1- Please do not allow anyone to change what is ours. We need to stop the vandalism of our cultural. Places
2- Without specifics of the measures to be taken and on ground reflection of intent, these promises seem hollow.
3- In all eight directions, BDAA dhous plan a miniforest which is atleat as big as lalbagh.
4- Heritage to maintain as we have given space 70% to outsiders only
5- Repeating heritage structure designs should not be encouraged. Example is the vikas soudha. It is a poor copy of the Vidhana Soudha and by sitting next to it, it spoils the heritage value of Vidhana Soudha.  
6- Very good
7- As far I see,  most of the listed have already been destroyed in the name of development. e.g. MG road,  what's left of this place anymore.  The Metro has ruined it's character and the skyscrapers are not doing it any good
