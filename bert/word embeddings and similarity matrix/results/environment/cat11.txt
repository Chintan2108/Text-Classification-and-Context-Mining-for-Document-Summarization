better manage waste materials
=====================================

44- Please educate house members, especially house wives about waste segregation and not to tie  garbage in plastic cover and throw. Please ban plastic, before banning please provide ideas and alternatives for groceries packing . All the vendors in Prashanth Nagar areas have plastic.. worst !!
71- Implementation of plants should be done in every places as it enhances the reducing in the pollution also helps in reducing the health care problems which are associated with the pollition there are several new techniques for implementation purpose not one to discuss it's better to discuss by speaking with each other 
138- Waste water and other waste treatment plant should be there in the apartments.  Proper arrangements should be made in the factories for chemical waste disposal instead of channeling to the lakes and other water bodies.
150- No construction  n no industry waste flowing strictly into lake beds. 
164- We need to make hard rules and should follow them without any if and but. We have do some public gathering to encourage people to contribute for the better environment. Even plastic ban in Bangalore, we can easily find that people are using it (even it has reduced but not fully). I am agree that only Gov body can do until people are not supporting so we have to make the Clean India Healthy India Campaign more frequently. We can start some program like Swach Bharat Ambassador for a particular area. It may help other people to participate in this actively. 
167- Use of green technologies and solar power must be definitely looked into. We need to live a plastic free life and make sure we dont create waste at all thereby altogether avoiding waste disposal needs. Bio degradable way of life what is followed in Indian villages - eating on leaf plates for example - must be followed. Defecating or Urinating in public must be severely dealt with and people should be heavily fined. Use of public toilets should be encouraged in line with "Swacch Bharat" from PM Sri Narendra Modi.
