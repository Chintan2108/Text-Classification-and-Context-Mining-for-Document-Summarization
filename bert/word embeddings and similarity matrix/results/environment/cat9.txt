The city will have charging stations for battery operated cars
=====================================

16- The plan sounds very vague at the moment. 
17- Sound like unrealistic aims for our governments. Battery operated cars have yet to reach that level of sophistication, though it is possible by 2031. Getting people to move on from petrol and diesel will be harder. 
23- The park and road should be monitored by the Area Authority on monthly basis.They should install proper lighting and maintenance of the platform as well.Tress should be planted more and government should encourage citizen to use cycle more.They should even plan events for cycling and should have Cycle stand and Cycles on rent installed so that the pollution level can come down as well as the parking space issue can be solved.This should start with our Elite Government officials first,so that more and more people will be encouraged by this gesture.
35- Cutting of trees for absolutely unnecessary reasons makes me furious. The trees are cut for road widening purposes where after couple of metres, the road merges back into a 2 lane road. What is the point? And the size of the trees being cut are enormous (easily 30-50 years old)  and are done in the night so that it is not noticed by any one who is  against it. The amount of shade and protection that these trees give is so much that the road makes you feel like home itself. But so many trees are cut, no one feels to come out during the day time. There is no point in chanting sustainability, saving of water, pollution free, or whatever it is if trees are going to be cut down like this. And after all the cutting, I have never seen any replacement efforts and it hurts me as I cannot do anything alone. Are human beings so selfish that we only care about our present comforts? Are we so stupid that we can't see what this is doing to our earth? I don't mind contributing to make out planet a much greener place. Everyone is so selfish and greedy and lazy that no one wants to do work and only wants money. 
40- The master plan look promising. But I hope there would be action. IT Projects getting approved in Brookfield area without concerned about traffic. Noise and pollution on the rise. Bad roads are one of the main reason for pollution. Govt can try odd/even formula at least once a week. Private vehicles(unpooled) are allowed at 10AM. Buses should connect IT park.
66- Because of the recent changes in Bangalore roads. The roads have been dug up... And many people have fallen sick most of 2017 or have faced breathing problems. Dust gathers everywhere and commuting doesnt only turn hard but next to impossible. 
106- * maintainace of existing lakes,  bus depot should not acquire the lakes to construct it.   * no waste should be released to lakes,  * government should provide subsidies to buy electric vehicles and make mandatory electric vehicles for students ( cycle or electric vehicle),  * provide attractive exchange offers to buy electric vehicles( on old petrol/diesel vehicles)   * all public transport with in the city should be electric vehicles.
140- The BBMP and BDA are imposing rules but not taking appropriate steps to ensure everyone is adhering to it. Also people get away with not following the set regulations by bribing the authorities which needs to stop.
146- The environment must not just be limited to plants and lakes, animals form a huge component.Poor stray animals wander about( and it actually isnt their mistake, where are they gonna go if their.land is encroached by bangalorean in making houses and roads) They share this land as much as we do.It is painful to see these poor animals being chased away from almost anywhere.What happened to the green city? what happned to the nature of ayiti devo bhava? Where humbleness and generosity was part in each citizen?
173- The Decision is good, but only if administration and maintenance becomes really strict, without any corruption.
