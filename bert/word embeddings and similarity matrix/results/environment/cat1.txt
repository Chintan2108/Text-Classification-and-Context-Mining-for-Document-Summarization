the municipality will plant trees
=====================================

4- Chopping of trees should be stopped unless it's a matter of concern to life. 
34- Banglore should go for strong trees than the exisiting thin and strongless trees breaks down when heavy rain fall.
47- there are ample trees being planted nor are there any proper maintenance of parks and lakes. some immense drives should be held to plant more trees along with tech parks every month(suggestion)
57- make it mandatory to plant trees by all the citizens around their houses. lake should be protected and proper sewage system should be maintained
64- Planting more and more trees isn't a option anymore, it's become a necessity
68- Their should small jungle in every part of bangalore the technique of this jungle is used by HAL where a small 10*20 place will be filled with trees and managed in such a way that their is no place inside by setting up of small mini size to huge trees in a orderly way this will fight pollution and save greenery
77- Stop cutting trees, start growing trees
88- Save trees
104- Who will maintain the planted trees? Till now all the planted trees are died without no Maintanance and water supply
110- Bangalore is especially known for its green art and named as garden city....so I request to plant trees along the road side,provide clean footpaths with benches and some decorative things like that which makes the city look beautiful...and also a request to not allow anyone spit chewing gums and pan and all
134- Ensure each housing society has trees planted, roof top gardens and zero discharge
147- Please do plant more trees and maintain the name given to us as a garden city 
153- Unsatisfied with the development and need to show intrest and improve the grenery plant the trees where it is required in every road with plan 
161- stop cutting the trees 1st
181- Where is the space to plant trees, footpaths have been trimmed and will become non-existent with the expansion of road to accommodate more vehicles, electric poles, transformers and traffic signs. My opinion would be to have an lane entirely dedicated for pedestrians and trees. At least the minimum we can think of is having an elevated footpath in places of dense and dangerous traffic or if we are more kind and generous towards saving environment make elevated cycle tracks.
185- The garden city is becoming  hotter. More trees to be planted in boundaries of the layout,road sides and gardens.
