use solar energy
=====================================

61- Well, I think solar energy should be widely supported by many people.. and each house should start taking this very seriously. Tesla as a company is doing so much better to the earth through sustainable energy. 
159- Needs more green spaces. Make use of solar energy in existing areas. Plant trees on the opposite sides of the electricity poles (better to channelize all wires underground). So trees can grow without being chopped off. Make open spaces in every ward, parks with trees a must!
