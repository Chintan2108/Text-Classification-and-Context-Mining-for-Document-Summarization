promote the use of recycled water
=====================================

36- Even though a lot of effort is being done to improve the environment , we still have a filthy  environment. This is due to the indifference and ignorance of the public. We have to use a lot of publicity about achieving a clean and healthy place to live in. TV, Radio , Movie theaters,  all the Government offices, Hospitals, Schools and colleges can be used for conveying strong messages about the donts -like, littering, defecating, urinating, SPITTING,  in public places,  and  heavy fines have to be charged when rules are violated.  Even though  thin  plastic bags are banned shops and vendors are still using them.  Emission tests are not carried out by many vehicles .  How do they escape the scrutiny of the police! There are many BBMP buses emitting black smoke . There should be periodical checks .  Educationg the public is the first step . 
45- Please avoid using some expensive flower plant or ornamental plants. Try to use convenientional trees which which we used to plant in old Bangalore areas. Vertical gardening is also a good idea
51- The problem with a democratic national is that the development plans for the next few decades look brilliant on paper. At the top level of hierarchy, the problems are jot down and addressed with a practical solution.  But it's equally hopeless when it comes to the execution as we move down in the hierarchy.  There needs to be a strict evaluation of the ongoing plans to curb the wrongdoings and also promote the need for development among the citizens so that the general public can enforce the same by being a part of it voluntarily.  Gone are the days where we sit idle and blame the government. If we need to see the changes around us, we need to change as well. Just wishing the government promotes active participation of citizens for the development of cities. 
126- Please ban use of polybags and disposable cutlery. Road side hawkers attract IT population and have no proper disposal of garbage. Garbage of disposable and polythene goes in drains and on foot paths
