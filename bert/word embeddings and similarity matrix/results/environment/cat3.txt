create more parks and open spaces
=====================================

2- Make plastic free Bangalore that will biggest contribution towards environment, Where free land is there government can lease out NGO or interested people to plant trees with financial aids so that it will create environment and creates job opportunities
15- Complete disregard for the environment.  There should be more green spaces in the city.
26- Bangalore is name for trees/plants, parks and beautiful lakes inside city. BBMP is cutting down all plants, covering all lakes in the name of development is not acceptable. We do not need such development where there is no good environment. Do not cut down trees and do development with the available resources only.
56- Adequate spaces for pavements, and to be raised so that vehicles are detered from using it. And lighting should be adequate.
124- These plans are very generic. There needs to be a timeline, budget, name of person accountable, place where it plans to be implemented.  Please provide us with an open forum where we CAN TRACK WHAT ALL IS GETTING IMPLEMENTED
137- Why BBMP is allowing individual house owners to build houses wall to wall or even the builders without thinking of the parks and trees to be planted at home and apartments. Wherez the initiative to ncourage by providing grow bags and seeds to grow at home eg terrace garden, waste composting.
184- There are lot of open plots that have Parthenium and other Pollen plants which cause harm to health of everyone. We should have a rule of the owners cleaning their plots or BBMP charge them a nominal fee for the upkeep
