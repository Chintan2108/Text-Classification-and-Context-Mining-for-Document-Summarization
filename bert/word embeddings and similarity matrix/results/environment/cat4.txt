draw clear boundaries for forests, streams, lakes
=====================================

12- Vertical gardening and envirnmt structures must be mandated for tech parks..as the glass panes heats up the city..the encroached lakes must be tackled sternly..firstly BDA land allotment must be corruption free and must not allot lands which have issues
43- In the masterplan these ideas looks good unless executed to the true core. We are seeing lakes dying, temperature rising due to warming effects caused by less greenery in our surroundings, Vehicles causing noise and air pollution leading to poor quality of breathable air around us. Not only municipality has to plant more trees it has to be an individual's responsibility to contribute towards the society.
118- We should try to reserve the lakes of the city 
169- Would like all the lakes to have adopted wet land cultivation.
