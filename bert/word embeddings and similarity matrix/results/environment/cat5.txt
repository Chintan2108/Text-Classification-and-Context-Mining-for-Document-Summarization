encourage water harvesting
=====================================

7- Water harvesting needs to be forced on people , just encouraging it wont help. Its ok to force if it is for common good.
58- Bangalore has more borewells and many residential property has more then one and in particular places borewells goes up to 2000 meters approx.it's not right way,as bottom surface get dry due to no water.government need to restrict with borewells after certain meters(*very strictly*) and need to supply water so as to save ground water and need to give awareness the advantages of solar energy
85- One of the major issue of continuous urbanisation is the decrease of green coverage. The concrete areas formed by the roofs, roads, parkings create heat islands. Putting trees on the roads might help but the main built area (flat roofs) remain. Why not encouraging green roofs and roof  top cultivation? Coupling this with grey water recycling, will tackle the issue of water scarcity to maintain a green cover.
96- Some major steps must be taken to avoid water wastage 
111- Unavailability of ground water is an issue of grave concern 
133- Use of Solar electric power, rain water harvesting and home composting should be encouraged. We need to educate public in these areas. 
148- A larger comprehensive policy detail needs to be included. Planting trees is fine or water harvesting is also fine. How are we going to achieve them? What is the strategy behind the same? A lot of water is wasted just via drains. How do we use that to recharge our ground water levels? None of this is covered and just a statement does not help.
155- We also need to work on drainages water logging issue in Bangalore.
182- Ensure that existing trees & area around the trees are not covered with concrete and there is space for ground water to be replenished when it rains
