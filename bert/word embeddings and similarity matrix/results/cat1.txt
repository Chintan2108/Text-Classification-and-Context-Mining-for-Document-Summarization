203- While all of this sounds great on paper, implementation has always been an issue.
206- These skywalks serve more as advertisement platforms than public utilities.
207- Also, integration of public transport in terms of accessibility and convenience goes a long way in incentivising the population to forego their private vehicles.
210- Reliance on private vehicles to reach the airport is expected in such a situation.
211- However, the authorities are more interested in widening Jaymahal Road by removing itâ€™s green cover instead of fast tracking and prioritising the Airport Metro Line.

315- More can b done .
316- Most of the public transport is on diesel and the vehicles keep emitting dark black smoke at a very high rate, be it normal bus, Volvo or autos.
317- This needs serious attention as the day is not far when we will be shutdown like Delhi ! Just do not go by the air quality index as it is good due to high altitude and powerful wind which sweeps away these toxic fumes.
318- Tree cutting should be kept to a minimum.
