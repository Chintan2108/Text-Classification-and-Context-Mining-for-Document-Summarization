The city will have charging stations for battery operated cars
=====================================

10- The lung space is reducing heavily.
41- The plan sounds very vague at the moment.
43- Battery operated cars have yet to reach that level of sophistication, though it is possible by 2031.
57- The park and road should be monitored by the Area Authority on monthly basis.
66- Bycycle should be distributed at all metro stations to reduce the usage of other transports.
95- The trees are cut for road widening purposes where after couple of metres, the road merges back into a 2 lane road.
115- The master plan look promising.
146- The problem with a democratic national is that the development plans for the next few decades look brilliant on paper.
191- The roads have been dug up.
204- The preparation for a Master Plan for the future must reflect in the attitudes of the authorities in the present and the authorities currently seem hell bent on making decisions that are not in favour of the ecology and aesthetics of the city.
205- The rampant construction of skywalks in the city is a case in point.
208- The authorities have completely neglected this factor while deciding the location of the Cantonment Metro Station despite many valid counters to their technical arguments by select and credible individuals from the society.
209- The Kempegowda International Airport is 11 years old but we still donâ€™t have a fully functional Metro/Rail system traversing the 40 km distance from the city to the airport.
270- The must be guidelines and rules regarding cutting of trees.
297- * no waste should be released to lakes, * government should provide subsidies to buy electric vehicles and make mandatory electric vehicles for students ( cycle or electric vehicle), * provide attractive exchange offers to buy electric vehicles( on old petrol/diesel vehicles) * all public transport with in the city should be electric vehicles.
322- The 2.
325- The BDA's approach to green cover (pg 79) is simply copied and pasted from a best practice elsewhere to give a semblance of concern, as the commercial zoning currently (mal)practiced recognises no need for ever a ward green space.
353- Pollution cannot be curbed just by installing tree, reduce the reduction of diesel cars for private use.
405- The city needs docking points so that people can dock their cycles effectively.
408- The BBMP and BDA are imposing rules but not taking appropriate steps to ensure everyone is adhering to it.
412- Move further out only and have wide signal free road to commute to city or metro extension.
414- The idea is awesome but will it be really executed or possible in this corrupt state.
429- The environment must not just be limited to plants and lakes, animals form a huge component.
461- Is there no end to human greed? The air quality index has broken the scale to worst and still administration is busy minting money by shielding land/sand mafia.
469- The regular offenders being the Government Institutions and the BBMP Garbage Contractors/Handlers.
476- The details of toilet construction is not sufficient enough.
507- The Decision is good, but only if administration and maintenance becomes really strict, without any corruption.
531- Second, The green area cannot be only on the peripheries.
537- Sixth, charging stations cannot be small establishments and at localised points.
