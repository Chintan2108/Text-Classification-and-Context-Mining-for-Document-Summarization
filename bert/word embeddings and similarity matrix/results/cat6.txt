337- They do not use such illegal and ugly looking things in their cities, why should we?, they respect their citizens, do we? This will be a major change in my opinion and restore Bangalore's beauty.
350- Please ban use of polybags and disposable cutlery.
407- This will promote a new kind of culture, and will benefit the city in the long run.
437- How are we going to achieve them? What is the strategy behind the same? A lot of water is wasted just via drains.
438- How do we use that to recharge our ground water levels? None of this is covered and just a statement does not help.
445- Promote e bicycle, since the cost of living near to office is high we stay far and use bike or car.
