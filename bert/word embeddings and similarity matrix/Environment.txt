84- this would b great if v are able to get food in the road .
85- The maximum impact to nature and environmental factors is due to the unhandled waste from the posters, ads, paper flyers all littered all around the city.
86- We need a law against littering in the public spaces.
87- We build beautiful bridges and the pillars are full of movie posters and political ads.
88- The trees are also not spared.
89- People put up pins and nails on trees to put there posters of PG ads and other things.
90- Can we please have our city back, beautiful and green and clean without all these litter every where we see.
91- Mainly have to stop cutting down the trees, if necessary try to replant those trees to another location where necessary.
92- Contact me for planting tree sampling where necessary for joining hands.
93- Banglore should go for strong trees than the exisiting thin and strongless trees breaks down when heavy rain fall.
94- Cutting of trees for absolutely unnecessary reasons makes me furious.
95- The trees are cut for road widening purposes where after couple of metres, the road merges back into a 2 lane road.
96- What is the point? And the size of the trees being cut are enormous (easily 30-50 years old)  and are done in the night so that it is not noticed by any one who is  against it.
97- The amount of shade and protection that these trees give is so much that the road makes you feel like home itself.
98- But so many trees are cut, no one feels to come out during the day time.
99- There is no point in chanting sustainability, saving of water, pollution free, or whatever it is if trees are going to be cut down like this.
100- And after all the cutting, I have never seen any replacement efforts and it hurts me as I cannot do anything alone.
101- Are human beings so selfish that we only care about our present comforts? Are we so stupid that we can't see what this is doing to our earth? I don't mind contributing to make out planet a much greener place.
102- Everyone is so selfish and greedy and lazy that no one wants to do work and only wants money.
103- Even though a lot of effort is being done to improve the environment , we still have a filthy  environment.
104- This is due to the indifference and ignorance of the public.
105- We have to use a lot of publicity about achieving a clean and healthy place to live in.
106- TV, Radio , Movie theaters,  all the Government offices, Hospitals, Schools and colleges can be used for conveying strong messages about the donts -like, littering, defecating, urinating, SPITTING,  in public places,  and  heavy fines have to be charged when rules are violated.

120- Govt can try odd/even formula at least once a week.
121- Private vehicles(unpooled) are allowed at 10AM.
122- Buses should connect IT park.
123- Lands of lakes should be reclaimed in full force.
124- Also the reclaimed land has to be turned back into lakes and the water catchment area of the lakes have to be taken over and turned green.
125- This has to happen by force else water will be a major crisis for Bangalore in another 2 years.
126- If we think about using force now we will be left with a city with no water.
127- Need to keep the city Clean.
128- In the masterplan these ideas looks good unless executed to the true core.
129- We are seeing lakes dying, temperature rising due to warming effects caused by less greenery in our surroundings, Vehicles causing noise and air pollution leading to poor quality of breathable air around us.
130- Not only municipality has to plant more trees it has to be an individual's responsibility to contribute towards the society.
131- Please educate house members, especially house wives about waste segregation and not to tie  garbage in plastic cover and throw.
132- Please ban plastic, before banning please provide ideas and alternatives for groceries packing .
133- All the vendors in Prashanth Nagar areas have plastic.
134- worst !!.
135- Please avoid using some expensive flower plant or ornamental plants.
136- Try to use convenientional trees which which we used to plant in old Bangalore areas.
137- Vertical gardening is also a good idea.
138- Please install many public garbage bins.
139- there are ample trees being planted nor are there any proper maintenance of parks and lakes.
140- some immense drives should be held to plant more trees along with tech parks every month(suggestion).
141- highly polluted city .
142- Instead of planting trees, trees are being cut.
143- The proud thing of Bengaluru was trees and alot of trees which is being cut, Bengaluru is losing its pride,its temperature is changed only because of this, IT sectors other people are coming to B'lore and there's no much space left so trees are being cut but when you chop one tree its like taking alot of lives, I request you to please make B'lore as before.
144- Please.
145- Dissatisfied.
146- The problem with a democratic national is that the development plans for the next few decades look brilliant on paper.
147- At the top level of hierarchy, the problems are jot down and addressed with a practical solution.
148- But it's equally hopeless when it comes to the execution as we move down in the hierarchy.
149- There needs to be a strict evaluation of the ongoing plans to curb the wrongdoings and also promote the need for development among the citizens so that the general public can enforce the same by being a part of it voluntarily.
150- Gone are the days where we sit idle and blame the government.
151- If we need to see the changes around us, we need to change as well.
152- Just wishing the government promotes active participation of citizens for the development of cities.
153- The newly planted tree saplings will take minimum 10 years to become a tree, so the aim should be to preserve the existing flora.
154- While planting new trees, the trees should be sturdy, in the sense, it should not succumb for mild wind guesses after 10 years.
155- At least 31 ratio of plantation should be done for each and every tree that is brought down in the name of development.
156- BDA should restrain from cutting trees just because someone built a shopping complex with the entrance placed in front of the tree.
157- The shopping complex or any building should have been planned to avoid tree felling.
158- Everyone in the city-limit should take prior permission from the environment board before cutting any tree that is there in private or in public areas.
159- The reason and plan of the building should be reviewed and maximum number of trees should be saved.
160- Moreover, for every tree they cut, they should plant at least 2 tree saplings and show then as grown trees at the time of completing the construction project.
161- To conclude Aim should be to save the existing trees, rather than planting and waiting for another 10-15 years for them to become trees again.
162- NOTE BDA can consider relocation of trees with the latest technology and machines available and followed in few countries.
163- Great initiative.
164- I hope this gets implemented irrespective of which government rules.
165- Let me know if i could be helpful.
166- Please check into the the increasing noise pollution specially in the housing areas.
167- Many small garbage collection/ welding shops have opened up in Radha Reddy Layout, Doddakanelli, Off Sarjapur Road.
168- One of them is next to Mana Jardin.
169- I really wish the promises made by the municipality will be executed.
170- Bengaluru misses it's greenery!.
171- Adequate spaces for pavements, and to be raised so that vehicles are detered from using it.
172- And lighting should be adequate.
173- make it mandatory to plant trees by all the citizens around their houses.
174- lake should be protected and proper sewage system should be maintained.
175- Bangalore has more borewells and many residential property has more then one and in particular places borewells goes up to 2000 meters approx.
176- it's not right way,as bottom surface get dry due to no water.
177- government need to restrict with borewells after certain meters(*very strictly*) and need to supply water so as to save ground water and need to give awareness the advantages of solar energy.
178- Although all these ideas are novel and can make an impact when implemented properly, no assurance what so ever has been given regarding this and the method of implementation is again up for speculation.
179- Another major drawback is that these measures prevent future degradation but do not include any steps for rehabilitating the currently degrading environment.
180- It's important to educate as well as make people practice to plant trees only then will the city improve in.
181- Environmental issues.
182- Well, I think solar energy should be widely supported by many people.
183- and each house should start taking this very seriously.
184- Tesla as a company is doing so much better to the earth through sustainable energy.
185- Everything is good but there should be compulsory CSR responsibility given to every company residing in Bengaluru for managing the environment in the city here by reducing the stress for the BBMP to look after each and everything.
186- I wonder to what extent this would be implemented, most of these laws already exist and no one care.
187- Its vital to take legal actions.
188- Planting more and more trees isn't a option anymore, it's become a necessity.
189- Should stop New extension for construction of buildings.
190- Because of the recent changes in Bangalore roads.
191- The roads have been dug up.
192- And many people have fallen sick most of 2017 or have faced breathing problems.
193- Dust gathers everywhere and commuting doesnt only turn hard but next to impossible.
194- Please put down commercialisation of residential areas with an iron hand.
195- This will save our environment greatly and help children to study and play more.
196- Please increase play area for children as at present even branded schools have small play area.
197- Please ban honking by vehicles other than ambulances in the City.
198- There is no need for honking with in the city.
199- Please have one hour study for children every day on environment protection.
200- Their parents are a spoilt lot who also need environmental education.
201- Please Make it compulsory.
202- Their should small jungle in every part of bangalore the technique of this jungle is used by HAL where a small 10*20 place will be filled with trees and managed in such a way that their is no place inside by setting up of small mini size to huge trees in a orderly way this will fight pollution and save greenery.
203- While all of this sounds great on paper, implementation has always been an issue.
204- The preparation for a Master Plan for the future must reflect in the attitudes of the authorities in the present and the authorities currently seem hell bent on making decisions that are not in favour of the ecology and aesthetics of the city.
205- The rampant construction of skywalks in the city is a case in point.
206- These skywalks serve more as advertisement platforms than public utilities.
207- Also, integration of public transport in terms of accessibility and convenience goes a long way in incentivising the population to forego their private vehicles.
208- The authorities have completely neglected this factor while deciding the location of the Cantonment Metro Station despite many valid counters to their technical arguments by select and credible individuals from the society.
209- The Kempegowda International Airport is 11 years old but we still don’t have a fully functional Metro/Rail system traversing the 40 km distance from the city to the airport.
210- Reliance on private vehicles to reach the airport is expected in such a situation.
211- However, the authorities are more interested in widening Jaymahal Road by removing it’s green cover instead of fast tracking and prioritising the Airport Metro Line.
212- Transplantation of trees saves the trees.
213- However, it leaves their former/original location bereft of the benefits of their presence and hence causes immense ecological damage.
214- Tree planting has never been successful.
215- Saplings are planted, money is spent and forgotten.
216- They just wilt away after a few months due to lack of care.
217- Implementation of plants should be done in every places as it enhances the reducing in the pollution also helps in reducing the health care problems which are associated with the pollition there are several new techniques for implementation purpose not one to discuss it's better to discuss by speaking with each other .
218- Need to stop demolishing Bigg biggg trees,you can't plant a 1plant instead of 1bigg tree.
219- -Ban petrol and diesel 4-wheelers inside the city-Heavily subsidise electric vehicles (busses, cars, and two wheelers/bicycles )-Build electric charging infrastructure-Make Rain water harvesting, electricity generation via solar panels mandatory for medium to large scale housing projects.
220- good plan.
221- Rather than plantaing small plants which only serve the purpose of aesthetics please opt for big shrubs that grow upto a height of 10-12 feet in between dividers and under the flyovers.
222- Good idea.
223- Stop cutting trees, start growing trees.
224- Everyone should take responsibility .
225- What is the meaning of "will plant more trees".
226- Instead of that make mandatory to all who are living in Bangalore that they plant 40 trees and by the next 10 years 10 trees should grow to their full health It should be their responsibility that they should take care of these plants.
227- Those who can make survive 30+ plant reward them.
228- I think there are 8 million people in Bangalore.
229- Let's take 4 million are adult in this.
230- So this count after 10 years  there would be 40 million tree at least.
231- And this would be a great thing for this beautiful and important city.
232- We should ideally stop new construction it will bring in more deforestation .
233- For your writing inputs.
234- Need to properly streamline all the projects and complete them within the deadline.
235- - Initiative and Subsidy for buying electric vehicles.
236- - Initiative to maximize electric stations.
237- Build a smart, better and resilient infrastructure for electric vehicles to come in.
238- - Promote e bikes and cycles- Ban all polluting vehicles.
239- Move BMTC to electric - More strict regulations to protect our lake and lake beds.
240- Prevent any waste run-over and sewage discharge into lakes.
241- Build better aquatic environment in the lake.
242- - Waste management required- Sustainable development required.
243- New innovative wats to use renewable energy to peer the city required.
244- Just planting is not sufficient, sustaining the existing and maintaining the new plants is the necessary of the hour.
245- One of the major issue of continuous urbanisation is the decrease of green coverage.
246- The concrete areas formed by the roofs, roads, parkings create heat islands.
247- Putting trees on the roads might help but the main built area (flat roofs) remain.
248- Why not encouraging green roofs and roof  top cultivation? Coupling this with grey water recycling, will tackle the issue of water scarcity to maintain a green cover.
249- Plant small trees along all roads in around Bangalore and make a dense forest kind of plan so that city gets back it's old charm.
250- Bangalore has lost 80% of It's greenery.
251- Where there is a will there is a way, we can definitely restore the greenery.
252- You need to fix a date and begin the awareness campaign 6 months earlier so there is enough hype and awareness is created for all to participate.
253- Make lakhs of saplings available and start a "each plant a tree" campaign.
254- In 10 years time a lot of greenery will be restored.
255- Also if the land around Airport can be beautifully landscaped, the entire City should have such landscaping.
256- Let each builder take up the job of landscaping a few areas, in return the govt can offer them advertising space such that it doesn't spoil the beauty of the landscaped area.
257- Also we see so many illegal bills stuck all over the city especially flyover pillars.
258- Make it illegal and fine those companies that advertise on walls.
259- Save trees.
260- If this follows exactly what has been mentioned here, they Bangalore will become a great city.
261- I would just like to add a point regarding allocation of land space for new construction, there should be a gap to plant trees.
262- BDA has done good job in assessing environment.
263- A simple and more effective solution would be to involve public in environment protection.
264- Issue a Government Order mandating 1 Tree for every House with minimum of 1200 sq.
265- ft area of land.
266- Apartment complexes can also abide this rule.
267- This will ensure quick implementation of tree cover, and reduce temperature, and increase water resources through rain fall.
268- Very good view and thoughts from the government.
269- Cutting down of trees must be made difficult for everyone.
270- The must be guidelines and rules regarding cutting of trees.
271- Just planting new trees will not help unless the old ones are preserved.
272- regulate garbage.
273- invest in recycling plants or outsource it.
274- make it licensed and legal.
275- Implementation should be enforced strictly .
276- if we keep environment clean then we can have everything intact.
277- Tree planting should be made mandatory and vehicles should be made electrified, no more fossil fuel vehicles to be run on the roads.
278- Some major steps must be taken to avoid water wastage .
279- Do not make the situation that are facing big city like Bombay.
280- Dehil .
281- Tree are cut irresponsibly,the trees must be planted in 110 ratio ,if one tree is cut in the same locality 10 trees must be planted ,the parks ,lakes must be surrounded by trees ,the roades must be maintained, proper drainage system must be in place , public toilet system must be in each locality,where not possible temporary modern public toilet system should be made , where public density is more and traffic is intense no vehicle zone or only pedestrian roads to be made ,like these issues must be addressed .
282- I hope whatever things that has been mentioned here won't get limited to paper only.
283- I hope it will honestly get implemented.
284- Plant more trees in the bhanergatta forests and make all the bridges green by introducing more of hanging plants.
285- Industries into more of pollution shuld be asd to pay heavy penalty and asd to be shifted to the outskirts.
286- penalty shuld be nlmade compulsory to any industry within and outskirts of banglore.
287- The lakes in the city must be cleaned and shuld take enough preventions that they do not get polluted again after cleaning .
288- Making residents to mandate planting plants at home at least 1 plant per person.
289- You are playing with environment.
290- Should look at the sustainability of the plan .
291- Who will maintain the planted trees? Till now all the planted trees are died without no Maintanance and water supply.
292- Roof top gardens and Skywalker with plantation in localities that would have housing next to next, also in case of It company offices.
293- Flats and row houses must mandatory have garden space with trees.
294- BDA must increase public transport including metro and publicize lesser usage of personal cars.
295- Also, prohibit the use of personal cars within Bangalore during peak office hours.
296- * maintainace of existing lakes,  bus depot should not acquire the lakes to construct it.
297- * no waste should be released to lakes, * government should provide subsidies to buy electric vehicles and make mandatory electric vehicles for students ( cycle or electric vehicle), * provide attractive exchange offers to buy electric vehicles( on old petrol/diesel vehicles) * all public transport with in the city should be electric vehicles.
298- What about the emission of the vehicles? What about age old vehicles causing problems?.
299- Need to plan around the environment.
300- Please make it mandatory for all buildings to have rooftop gardens.
301- Bangalore is especially known for its green art and named as garden city.
302- so I request to plant trees along the road side,provide clean footpaths with benches and some decorative things like that which makes the city look beautiful.
303- and also a request to not allow anyone spit chewing gums and pan and all.
304- Unavailability of ground water is an issue of grave concern .
305- Planting trees will just not help because they will be chopped of my the Govt for road widening Or for Metro Or any other reasons.
306- Why cant we enable Vertical gardening.
307- Its consumes less space and more effective.
308- Infact the space below the Metro lane is now becoming a dumping yard.
309- It can be well maintained too.
310- Maintaining the water beds should be thought off.
311- we see the lakes are been converted to land .
312- Eg JP nagar Puttenhalli lake which was once a wide spread lake, today is making way for a big apartment to come up.
313- Even with heavy rains this year, there were no signs of water in it.
314- One side the govt passed order to demolish the buildings built on the water bed, and other side the govt itself is granting permissions for covering  the lake.
315- More can b done .
316- Most of the public transport is on diesel and the vehicles keep emitting dark black smoke at a very high rate, be it normal bus, Volvo or autos.
317- This needs serious attention as the day is not far when we will be shutdown like Delhi ! Just do not go by the air quality index as it is good due to high altitude and powerful wind which sweeps away these toxic fumes.
318- Tree cutting should be kept to a minimum.
319- During Road widening and flyover construction work, environmental aspects should have a greater say than the financial aspects.
320- Buildings rather than a line of trees should be the first to go for any widening work and during budgeting this should be taken care of.
321- A value has to be places on every tree just like market values are placed on property.
322- The 2.
323- 2% forested area estimated to be in the Bangalore urban region is absurdly optimistic, and of this most is outside the core area.
324- Look at the Banerghata National Park for an illustration of the problem its entire north-eastern and northern boundaries are densely built-up right to the park boundary.
325- The BDA's approach to green cover (pg 79) is simply copied and pasted from a best practice elsewhere to give a semblance of concern, as the commercial zoning currently (mal)practiced recognises no need for ever a ward green space.
326- Need lot improvement and it should be an agenda of development rather religion.
327- We should try to reserve the lakes of the city .
328- It's pathetic .
329- Seat n food holding tray was too dirty.
330- cleanliness poor.
331- Environment also means the how the city looks to people- currently ministers and other high ranked officials deface the looks of this city by putting up illegal wooden hoarding everywhere.
332- This is criminal.
333- Sometimes these hoardings are so much in your way that it causes inconvenience to a common man in his/her day-to-day life.
334- This must stop.
335- Levy heavy taxes/charges on these hoardings.
336- Why can't we be like any other international country.
337- They do not use such illegal and ugly looking things in their cities, why should we?, they respect their citizens, do we? This will be a major change in my opinion and restore Bangalore's beauty.

339- Let us set an example.
340- Make mandatory for residents/companies/corporates, in fact all to plant trees and also maintain them till they grow.

360- Only planting saplings will not help all these .
361- it should be taken care properly, so that it grows big instead dying as saplings itself.
362- Good to see planting tree point in the plan.
363- this was there earlier in 80s when one could see roadside plants with plant gaurds .

371- People who had open spaces and interest in planting were encouraged.
372- Over a period of time, everyone is interested in deviating the plan of their homes and building complete space of the site.
373- Hence, there is no space for planting.

397- Proper arrangements should be made in the factories for chemical waste disposal instead of channeling to the lakes and other water bodies.
398- There is no clear mandate from where citizens can access data.
399- The scare in Delhi and Mumbai is a clear lesson for urban developers that incessant development without planning will have an adverse affect on the economy sooner or later.
400- First and foremost, we need real time monitoring systems that can be accessed online.
401- This will ensure accountability.
402- Cycling and renewables needs a focus in the city.

405- The city needs docking points so that people can dock their cycles effectively.
406- There should be days when vehicular traffic is limited to cycles (for healthy people).

417- This needs to be properly mapped and monitored before executing any plans which will help to have cost effective and qualitative execution.
418- Also there should be strict sessions/syllabus in every school.
419- Me being from Kerala State, but feel so bad hearing sarcastic fun on laughing at Bangalore being called garden of the city as it isn't really green.

432- It is painful to see these poor animals being chased away from almost anywhere.
433- What happened to the green city? what happned to the nature of ayiti devo bhava? Where humbleness and generosity was part in each citizen?.
434- Please do plant more trees and maintain the name given to us as a garden city .
435- A larger comprehensive policy detail needs to be included.
436- Planting trees is fine or water harvesting is also fine.
437- How are we going to achieve them? What is the strategy behind the same? A lot of water is wasted just via drains.
438- How do we use that to recharge our ground water levels? None of this is covered and just a statement does not help.
439- Many of the building construction are illegal.
440- Only Bangalore was concentrated for development and many of the projects should have been moved to other cities.
441- Over population and illegal construction and cutting down trees, no waste management.
442- All these issue needs to be addressed.
443- All the lakes should be rejuvenated.
444- No more projects in Bangalore, convince the company to open in Mysore or any other cities.

486- Even plastic ban in Bangalore, we can easily find that people are using it (even it has reduced but not fully).

520- Not enough done for Bengaluru environment.
521- Where is the space to plant trees, footpaths have been trimmed and will become non-existent with the expansion of road to accommodate more vehicles, electric poles, transformers and traffic signs.
522- My opinion would be to have an lane entirely dedicated for pedestrians and trees.
523- At least the minimum we can think of is having an elevated footpath in places of dense and dangerous traffic or if we are more kind and generous towards saving environment make elevated cycle tracks.
524- Ensure that existing trees & area around the trees are not covered with concrete and there is space for ground water to be replenished when it rains.
525- Pollution at its height.
526- There are lot of open plots that have Parthenium and other Pollen plants which cause harm to health of everyone.
527- We should have a rule of the owners cleaning their plots or BBMP charge them a nominal fee for the upkeep.
528- The garden city is becoming  hotter.
529- More trees to be planted in boundaries of the layout,road sides and gardens.

540- Water bodies, very critical to protect from pollution.
541- Nice vision but practicality seems lacking.
542- how are you going to move heavy polluting industries? Why not start with things like banning the heavily polluting buses and requiring all taxis and autos to run on cng.
543- Solar.
544- ok but storage is more important.
545- How about stopping the burning of leaves and garbage?  Heavy fines? Enforcement of existing laws?.
546- Should increase the green cover by planting more fruit bearing trees as it will help birds.
547- Also water bodies must be protected and rain water harvesting made mandatory at specific layout level so as to make them serif sufficient for their water needs.
