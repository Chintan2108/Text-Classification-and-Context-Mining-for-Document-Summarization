94- The amount of shade and protection that these trees give is so much that the road makes you feel like home itself.
95- But so many trees are cut, no one feels to come out during the day time.
96- There is no point in chanting sustainability, saving of water, pollution free, or whatever it is if trees are going to be cut down like this.
97- And after all the cutting, I have never seen any replacement efforts and it hurts me as I cannot do anything alone.
98- Are human beings so selfish that we only care about our present comforts? Are we so stupid that we can't see what this is doing to our earth? I don't mind contributing to make out planet a much greener place.
99- Everyone is so selfish and greedy and lazy that no one wants to do work and only wants money.
100- Even though a lot of effort is being done to improve the environment , we still have a filthy  environment.
101- This is due to the indifference and ignorance of the public.

115- Lands of lakes should be reclaimed in full force.
116- Also the reclaimed land has to be turned back into lakes and the water catchment area of the lakes have to be taken over and turned green.
117- This has to happen by force else water will be a major crisis for Bangalore in another 2 years.
118- If we think about using force now we will be left with a city with no water.
119- Need to keep the city Clean.
120- In the masterplan these ideas looks good unless executed to the true core.
121- We are seeing lakes dying, temperature rising due to warming effects caused by less greenery in our surroundings, Vehicles causing noise and air pollution leading to poor quality of breathable air around us.
122- Not only municipality has to plant more trees it has to be an individual's responsibility to contribute towards the society.

132- some immense drives should be held to plant more trees along with tech parks every month(suggestion).
133- highly polluted city .
134- Instead of planting trees, trees are being cut.
135- The proud thing of Bengaluru was trees and alot of trees which is being cut, Bengaluru is losing its pride,its temperature is changed only because of this, IT sectors other people are coming to B'lore and there's no much space left so trees are being cut but when you chop one tree its like taking alot of lives, I request you to please make B'lore as before.
136- Please.
137- Dissatisfied.
138- The problem with a democratic national is that the development plans for the next few decades look brilliant on paper.
139- At the top level of hierarchy, the problems are jot down and addressed with a practical solution.
140- But it's equally hopeless when it comes to the execution as we move down in the hierarchy.
141- The newly planted tree saplings will take minimum 10 years to become a tree, so the aim should be to preserve the existing flora.
142- Great initiative.
143- I hope this gets implemented irrespective of which government rules.
144- Let me know if i could be helpful.
145- Please check into the the increasing noise pollution specially in the housing areas.
146- Many small garbage collection/ welding shops have opened up in Radha Reddy Layout, Doddakanelli, Off Sarjapur Road.
147- One of them is next to Mana Jardin.
148- I really wish the promises made by the municipality will be executed.
149- Bengaluru misses it's greenery!.
150- Adequate spaces for pavements, and to be raised so that vehicles are detered from using it.
151- And lighting should be adequate.
152- make it mandatory to plant trees by all the citizens around their houses.
153- lake should be protected and proper sewage system should be maintained.
154- Bangalore has more borewells and many residential property has more then one and in particular places borewells goes up to 2000 meters approx.
155- it's not right way,as bottom surface get dry due to no water.
156- government need to restrict with borewells after certain meters(*very strictly*) and need to supply water so as to save ground water and need to give awareness the advantages of solar energy.
157- Although all these ideas are novel and can make an impact when implemented properly, no assurance what so ever has been given regarding this and the method of implementation is again up for speculation.
158- Another major drawback is that these measures prevent future degradation but do not include any steps for rehabilitating the currently degrading environment.
159- It's important to educate as well as make people practice to plant trees only then will the city improve in.
160- Environmental issues.
161- Well, I think solar energy should be widely supported by many people.
162- and each house should start taking this very seriously.
163- Tesla as a company is doing so much better to the earth through sustainable energy.
164- Everything is good but there should be compulsory CSR responsibility given to every company residing in Bengaluru for managing the environment in the city here by reducing the stress for the BBMP to look after each and everything.
165- I wonder to what extent this would be implemented, most of these laws already exist and no one care.
166- Its vital to take legal actions.
167- Planting more and more trees isn't a option anymore, it's become a necessity.
168- Should stop New extension for construction of buildings.
169- Because of the recent changes in Bangalore roads.
170- The roads have been dug up.
171- And many people have fallen sick most of 2017 or have faced breathing problems.

178- Please have one hour study for children every day on environment protection.
179- Their parents are a spoilt lot who also need environmental education.
180- Please Make it compulsory.
181- Their should small jungle in every part of bangalore the technique of this jungle is used by HAL where a small 10*20 place will be filled with trees and managed in such a way that their is no place inside by setting up of small mini size to huge trees in a orderly way this will fight pollution and save greenery.
182- While all of this sounds great on paper, implementation has always been an issue.
183- The preparation for a Master Plan for the future must reflect in the attitudes of the authorities in the present and the authorities currently seem hell bent on making decisions that are not in favour of the ecology and aesthetics of the city.
184- Tree planting has never been successful.
185- Saplings are planted, money is spent and forgotten.
186- They just wilt away after a few months due to lack of care.
187- Implementation of plants should be done in every places as it enhances the reducing in the pollution also helps in reducing the health care problems which are associated with the pollition there are several new techniques for implementation purpose not one to discuss it's better to discuss by speaking with each other .
188- Need to stop demolishing Bigg biggg trees,you can't plant a 1plant instead of 1bigg tree.
189- -Ban petrol and diesel 4-wheelers inside the city.

192- Good idea.
193- Stop cutting trees, start growing trees.
194- Everyone should take responsibility .

198- For your writing inputs.
199- Need to properly streamline all the projects and complete them within the deadline.
200- - Initiative and Subsidy for buying electric vehicles.
201- Just planting is not sufficient, sustaining the existing and maintaining the new plants is the necessary of the hour.
202- One of the major issue of continuous urbanisation is the decrease of green coverage.
203- The concrete areas formed by the roofs, roads, parkings create heat islands.
204- Putting trees on the roads might help but the main built area (flat roofs) remain.
205- Why not encouraging green roofs and roof  top cultivation? Coupling this with grey water recycling, will tackle the issue of water scarcity to maintain a green cover.
206- Plant small trees along all roads in around Bangalore and make a dense forest kind of plan so that city gets back it's old charm.
207- Bangalore has lost 80% of It's greenery.
208- Where there is a will there is a way, we can definitely restore the greenery.
209- You need to fix a date and begin the awareness campaign 6 months earlier so there is enough hype and awareness is created for all to participate.
210- Make lakhs of saplings available and start a "each plant a tree" campaign.
211- In 10 years time a lot of greenery will be restored.
212- Save trees.
213- If this follows exactly what has been mentioned here, they Bangalore will become a great city.
214- I would just like to add a point regarding allocation of land space for new construction, there should be a gap to plant trees.
215- BDA has done good job in assessing environment.
216- A simple and more effective solution would be to involve public in environment protection.
217- Issue a Government Order mandating 1 Tree for every House with minimum of 1200 sq.
218- ft area of land.
219- Apartment complexes can also abide this rule.
220- This will ensure quick implementation of tree cover, and reduce temperature, and increase water resources through rain fall.
221- Very good view and thoughts from the government.
222- Cutting down of trees must be made difficult for everyone.
223- The must be guidelines and rules regarding cutting of trees.

235- I hope whatever things that has been mentioned here won't get limited to paper only.
236- I hope it will honestly get implemented.
237- Plant more trees in the bhanergatta forests and make all the bridges green by introducing more of hanging plants.
238- Making residents to mandate planting plants at home at least 1 plant per person.
239- You are playing with environment.
240- Should look at the sustainability of the plan .
241- Who will maintain the planted trees? Till now all the planted trees are died without no Maintanance and water supply.
242- Roof top gardens and Skywalker with plantation in localities that would have housing next to next, also in case of It company offices.
243- Flats and row houses must mandatory have garden space with trees.
244- BDA must increase public transport including metro and publicize lesser usage of personal cars.
245- Also, prohibit the use of personal cars within Bangalore during peak office hours.

247- What about the emission of the vehicles? What about age old vehicles causing problems?.

252- and also a request to not allow anyone spit chewing gums and pan and all.
253- Unavailability of ground water is an issue of grave concern .
254- Planting trees will just not help because they will be chopped of my the Govt for road widening Or for Metro Or any other reasons.
255- Why cant we enable Vertical gardening.
256- Its consumes less space and more effective.
257- Infact the space below the Metro lane is now becoming a dumping yard.
258- It can be well maintained too.
259- More can b done .
260- Most of the public transport is on diesel and the vehicles keep emitting dark black smoke at a very high rate, be it normal bus, Volvo or autos.
261- This needs serious attention as the day is not far when we will be shutdown like Delhi ! .
262- Tree cutting should be kept to a minimum.
263- During Road widening and flyover construction work, environmental aspects should have a greater say than the financial aspects.
264- Buildings rather than a line of trees should be the first to go for any widening work and during budgeting this should be taken care of.
265- A value has to be places on every tree just like market values are placed on property.
266- The 2.
267- 2% forested area estimated to be in the Bangalore urban region is absurdly optimistic, and of this most is outside the core area.
268- Look at the Banerghata National Park for an illustration of the problem its entire north-eastern and northern boundaries are densely built-up right to the park boundary.
269- The BDA's approach to green cover (pg 79) is simply copied and pasted from a best practice elsewhere to give a semblance of concern, as the commercial zoning currently (mal)practiced recognises no need for ever a ward green space.
270- Need lot improvement and it should be an agenda of development rather religion.
271- We should try to reserve the lakes of the city .
272- It's pathetic .
273- Seat n food holding tray was too dirty.
274- cleanliness poor.
275- Environment also means the how the city looks to people- currently ministers and other high ranked officials deface the looks of this city by putting up illegal wooden hoarding everywhere.
276- This is criminal.
277- Sometimes these hoardings are so much in your way that it causes inconvenience to a common man in his/her day-to-day life.
278- This must stop.
279- Levy heavy taxes/charges on these hoardings.
280- Why can't we be like any other international country.
281- They do not use such illegal and ugly looking things in their cities, why should we?, they respect their citizens, do we? This will be a major change in my opinion and restore Bangalore's beauty.
282- A STRICT RULE TO ERADICATE ALL POLITICAL, NON-POLITICAL BANNERS FROM OUR LOVELY BANGALORE CITY.
283- Let us set an example.
284- Make mandatory for residents/companies/corporates, in fact all to plant trees and also maintain them till they grow.
285- Moving Polluted industries outside city does not look like a good idea, working around controlling and reducing them shd be part.
286- Forest and water bodies shd not be touched but to be maintained.
287- Solar power to be in use immediately and let go others for preservation.
288- Very clear demarcation on usage of public property- roads for driving, footpaths for walking etc.
289- Ban on chewing gums and any non bio degradable food item.
290- These plans are very generic.
291- There needs to be a timeline, budget, name of person accountable, place where it plans to be implemented.

301- please stop cutting trees and Govt.
302- should bring rules such as for every one new building permit they should have plant sapled and they should take care.
303- Good to see planting tree point in the plan.
304- this was there earlier in 80s when one could see roadside plants with plant gaurds .
305- after IT revolution started, this became another photo op or event instead of being a regular activity by the concerned department.
306- Please ensure no big trees are cut or if they have to, should be translocate else where.
307- Have a immediate movement called "Bring back Greenery" and go on offensive planting trees as part of or outside this plan.

327- Trees should be planted all roads not only major roads.
328- Ensure minimum one tree per house should be achieved.
329- Segregation of waste and wet waste should be converted in to manure and used for the plantation of trees.
330- Why BBMP is allowing individual house owners to build houses wall to wall or even the builders without thinking of the parks and trees to be planted at home and apartments.
331- Wherez the initiative to ncourage by providing grow bags and seeds to grow at home eg terrace garden, waste composting.
332- Waste water and other waste treatment plant should be there in the apartments.
333- Proper arrangements should be made in the factories for chemical waste disposal instead of channeling to the lakes and other water bodies.
334- There is no clear mandate from where citizens can access data.
335- The scare in Delhi and Mumbai is a clear lesson for urban developers that incessant development without planning will have an adverse affect on the economy sooner or later.
336- The BBMP and BDA are imposing rules but not taking appropriate steps to ensure everyone is adhering to it.
337- Also people get away with not following the set regulations by bribing the authorities which needs to stop.
338- Don't increase urbanization.
339- Don't increase FAR for construction.
340- Move further out only and have wide signal free road to commute to city or metro extension.
341- Also make sure to plant a tree with every cut down of a tree used for houses and carpentry .
342- The idea is awesome but will it be really executed or possible in this corrupt state.
343- Every new plan come comes with a heavy cost which end of the day is bared by common public.
344- How? Means XYZ authority take cost approval from respective authorities in the name of development which includes bribe for each and every person.
345- This needs to be properly mapped and monitored before executing any plans which will help to have cost effective and qualitative execution.
346- Also there should be strict sessions/syllabus in every school.
347- Looks good.
348- This sounds like a good plan, please implement .
