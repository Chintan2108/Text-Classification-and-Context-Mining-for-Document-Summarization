Karnataka can follow the Delhi model wherein public schools are getting improved, also more kids are leaving private schools to join public schools. Improve the infrastructure of the government schools. Digitize all sorts of necessary processes both in government and in private. Education in karnataka is not merely equal to education in Bengaluru. Develop schools in the other districts as well. Don't make school children burden by  carrying such heavy bags. It would be better if this is implemented. Nowadays, school is not a place to learn, but to get a 10th certificate. Let all schools tie up with edu start-ups. Same goes to colleges and universities also. Let certain universities have a MOU with foreign universities.

I have observed that the government schools lacks: 1. complete infrastructure,  2. awareness about the importance of education among the students,  3. interest among teachers.   The first issue needs urgent attention as few schools lack toilets for students and thus creates an impact on their attendance.  There's also need for basic laboratory facilities so that the students learn science with the help of experiments under supervision. This creates interest among students to pursue the career of their choice.  There needs to be a well stacked library for the students so that they can read inspirational books to develop a good character and become a responsible citizen in the society.   The students should also be provided with facilities to support their extra-curricular activities like sports, dance, singing, art among others. This gives a great platform and confidence for the students to follow their passion.  The second issue is solved when we provide enough opportunities for the students by solving the first issue. The importance of education should be known to every student and their parents because lot of students drop out of school due to financial or social issues. This needs to addressed by counseling the parents and informing them about the facilities provided by government to promote education.  And the lack of interest among the teachers is a well known issue in government schools. This needs quick attention since a student learns from their teacher.  Teachers need to be selected based on merit and their interest for teaching. If this is done, the government is successful in promoting education for all.\n", "18- Apart from this there needs to be compulsory practice of cleanliness as well as good environmental practices to be done at school levels, educating children and in turn educating parents for a better education and a better Bangalore \n", "20- It is not enough if more Govt Schools are set up. Problem is no one including economically weaker sections of the society would like to send their children to Govt Schools. So quality of schools should be better. Environmental studies in greater detail should be essential part of curriculum. Children should be made aware of noise and air pollution. There can be incentive for children who walk to schools or use public transport as opposed to getting dropped by parents. This way children will become aware of using public transport.

This means access to quality education by everyone.\n", "27- Apart from having a sufficient number of schools accessible to all, it is really necessary to focus on quality so that public schools have more uniform standards, making it possible for children to neighbourhood schools thereby reducing traffic. It is also imperative to educate children about the history, language and culture of Bengaluru so that they are better integrated in the city unlike the current situation where there is a complete cultural and linguistic erosion.

It is an burden on children as children as young as 2 years are put into care homes or kinder gardens. As an result more institutions are created for making money and are often industries or factories processing kids. On an average at least one of the married couple husband or wife will have an minimum qualification of graduation. Hence they can educate them at home until they are 5 or 6yrs old which is safe for parents and kids, it will discourage the greedy education industry, no risk of transport or crime or unhealthy food. So if the government comes up with an online certification or common examination centre where it can provide some assessments or grades for kids especially age 3 to 5 years annually and make it completely legal which will help them in entering primary schools.

Planting trees will just not help because they will be chopped of my the Govt for road widening Or for Metro Or any other reasons. Why cant we enable Vertical gardening. Its consumes less space and more effective. Infact the space below the Metro lane is now becoming a dumping yard. It can be well maintained too. 2. Maintaining the water beds should be thought off. we see the lakes are been converted to land . Eg: JP nagar Puttenhalli lake which was once a wide spread lake, today is making way for a big apartment to come up. Even with heavy rains this year, there were no signs of water in it. One side the govt passed order to demolish the buildings built on the water bed, and other side the govt itself is granting permissions for covering  the lake.   3.  \n", "115- Tree cutting should be kept to a minimum. During Road widening and flyover construction work, environmental aspects should have a greater say than the financial aspects. Buildings rather than a line of trees should be the first to go for any widening work and during budgeting this should be taken care of. A value has to be places on every tree just like market values are placed on property. \n", "122- Make mandatory for residents/companies/corporates, in fact all to plant trees and also maintain them till they grow. Moving Polluted industries outside city does not look like a good idea, working around controlling and reducing them shd be part. Forest and water bodies shd not be touched but to be maintained.

Now they are giving subsidy on current, if solar plants is installed similarly they should give subsidy on current or water if they have a tree planted which is recorded by government for that individual house/building, so that people will concentrate on that.   Only planting saplings will not help all these ...it should be taken care properly, so that it grows big instead dying as saplings itself.\n", "131- Good to see planting tree point in the plan.. this was there earlier in 80s when one could see roadside plants with plant gaurds .. after IT revolution started, this became another photo op or event instead of being a regular activity by the concerned department.

During the tenure of Mr. Ramakrishna Hegde it was encouraged by distributing free saplings in each ward. People who had open spaces and interest in planting were encouraged.  Over a period of time, everyone is interested in deviating the plan of their homes and building complete space of the site. Hence, there is no space for planting. This is leading to lot of air pollution in many areas and thus causing health issues for many people residing in Bangalore.  If you want to still retain Bangalore as \"Green City\" tag, then now is the time to change it. Please take some serious look.\n", "136- Trees should be planted all roads not only major roads.

This needs to be properly mapped and monitored before executing any plans which will help to have cost effective and qualitative execution. Also there should be strict sessions/syllabus in every school.  Me being from Kerala State, but feel so bad hearing sarcastic fun on laughing at Bangalore being called garden of the city as it isn't really green. We should give this job to Army personals who are good and maintaining and managing green.

At the top level of hierarchy, the problems are jot down and addressed with a practical solution.  But it's equally hopeless when it comes to the execution as we move down in the hierarchy.  There needs to be a strict evaluation of the ongoing plans to curb the wrongdoings and also promote the need for development among the citizens so that the general public can enforce the same by being a part of it voluntarily.  Gone are the days where we sit idle and blame the government. If we need to see the changes around us, we need to change as well.

The preparation for a Master Plan for the future must reflect in the attitudes of the authorities in the present and the authorities currently seem hell bent on making decisions that are not in favour of the ecology and aesthetics of the city.  The rampant construction of skywalks in the city is a case in point. These skywalks serve more as advertisement platforms than public utilities.  Also, integration of public transport in terms of accessibility and convenience goes a long way in incentivising the population to forego their private vehicles.   The authorities have completely neglected this factor while deciding the location of the Cantonment Metro Station despite many valid counters to their technical arguments by select and credible individuals from the society.  The Kempegowda International Airport is 11 years old but we still don\u2019t have a fully functional Metro/Rail system traversing the 40 km distance from the city to the airport. Reliance on private vehicles to reach the airport is expected in such a situation. However, the authorities are more interested in widening Jaymahal Road by removing it\u2019s green cover instead of fast tracking and prioritising the Airport Metro Line.  Transplantation of trees saves the trees. However, it leaves their former/original location bereft of the benefits of their presence and hence causes immense ecological damage.\n", "87- Bangalore has lost 80% of It's greenery.  Where there is a will there is a way, we can definitely restore the greenery. You need to fix a date and begin the awareness campaign 6 months earlier so there is enough hype and awareness is created for all to participate. Make lakhs of saplings available and start a \"each plant a tree\" campaign. In 10 years time a lot of greenery will be restored.   Also if the land around Airport can be beautifully landscaped, the entire City should have such landscaping. Let each builder take up the job of landscaping a few areas, in return the govt can offer them advertising space such that it doesn't spoil the beauty of the landscaped area.   Also we see so many illegal bills stuck all over the city especially flyover pillars. Make it illegal and fine those companies that advertise on walls. \n", "97- Do not make the situation that are facing big city like Bombay....

The lakes in the city must be cleaned and shuld take enough preventions that they do not get polluted again after cleaning \n", "116- The 2.2% forested area estimated to be in the Bangalore urban region is absurdly optimistic, and of this most is outside the core area. Look at the Banerghata National Park for an illustration of the problem: its entire north-eastern and northern boundaries are densely built-up right to the park boundary. The BDA's approach to green cover (pg 79) is simply copied and pasted from a best practice elsewhere to give a semblance of concern, as the commercial zoning currently (mal)practiced recognises no need for ever a ward green space. \n", "121- Environment also means the how the city looks to people- currently ministers and other high ranked officials deface the looks of this city by putting up illegal wooden hoarding everywhere. This is criminal. Sometimes these hoardings are so much in your way that it causes inconvenience to a common man in his/her day-to-day life. This must stop. Levy heavy taxes/charges on these hoardings. Why can't we be like any other international country. They do not use such illegal and ugly looking things in their cities, why should we?, they respect their citizens, do we? This will be a major change in my opinion and restore Bangalore's beauty. A STRICT RULE TO ERADICATE ALL POLITICAL, NON-POLITICAL BANNERS FROM OUR LOVELY BANGALORE CITY. Let us set an example.\n", "139- There is no clear mandate from where citizens can access data. The scare in Delhi and Mumbai is a clear lesson for urban developers that incessant development without planning will have an adverse affect on the economy sooner or later.   First and foremost, we need real time monitoring systems that can be accessed online. This will ensure accountability.   Cycling and renewables needs a focus in the city. Bangalore is one of those cities in our country which can easily be converted to the ways of cycling with minimal effort. We need cycling lanes and public sharing systems. The city needs docking points so that people can dock their cycles effectively. There should be days when vehicular traffic is limited to cycles (for healthy people). This will promote a new kind of culture, and will benefit the city in the long run.\n", "149- Many of the building construction are illegal. Only Bangalore was concentrated for development and many of the projects should have been moved to other cities. Over population and illegal construction and cutting down trees, no waste management. All these issue needs to be addressed. 1. All the lakes should be rejuvenated.  2. No more projects in Bangalore, convince the company to open in Mysore or any other cities.  3. Promote e bicycle, since the cost of living near to office is high we stay far and use bike or car. If cost of living reduced we can stay near to office and go by bicycle it's healthy and good for environment.  I am happy to suggest and participate in any initiative.

Second, The green area cannot be only on the peripheries. They have to be evenly distributed throughout the city to have an impact.   Third, flyover and metro pillars need to employ vertical gardens.   Fourth, dust and sand cleaning needs to be implemented using machines that are used internationally.   Fifth, Desilting and cleaning of lakes and interconnectivity of lakes needs to be introduced if not already existent. Flooding of low lying areas can be dramatically reduced if these are implemented.   Sixth, charging stations cannot be small establishments and at localised points. They need to be interconnected at metro stations, malls, airport.

The trees are cut for road widening purposes where after couple of metres, the road merges back into a 2 lane road. What is the point? And the size of the trees being cut are enormous (easily 30-50 years old)  and are done in the night so that it is not noticed by any one who is  against it. The amount of shade and protection that these trees give is so much that the road makes you feel like home itself. But so many trees are cut, no one feels to come out during the day time. There is no point in chanting sustainability, saving of water, pollution free, or whatever it is if trees are going to be cut down like this. And after all the cutting, I have never seen any replacement efforts and it hurts me as I cannot do anything alone. Are human beings so selfish that we only care about our present comforts?

Not to mention, every time the road infrastructure is improved, some person from BESCOM (among others) starts digging. All new layouts including government and private layouts, need to be established with underground electricity connectivity. This ensures that the ground level infrastructure is not disturbed and also this method is proven to be more robust and easier to maintain. BESCOM should jointly work with BDA to first build ducts / passages along major roads (e.g. ORR) and ensure that all power systems and transmission lines are laid underground. This will help sustain any widening or repair of the roads without shifting electricity poles. Not to mention, this will also vastly improve the livelihood of our electricians / linemen who bravely go up poles to repair any issues. \n", "33- Now a days some how they improved the electricity improve. but still we have to do proper plan and re-alignment for Electrical. better all electrical supply should be underground. so we can avoid more work and less maintenance \n"], "use of renewable energy\n": ["9- I think Use of solar and wind energy rather than using nuclear power must be followed strictly in states\n", "12- Need lot of improvements in using the renewable resources and also the maintenance towards the transformers and wirings in residential areas.\n"], "incentivize energy efficient gadgets\n": ["17- The best way to encourage companies and individuals to shift to solar energy is by: 1.

BTP even though doing a great job, there is a long way to go which is not being taken seriously. Ask me for solutions and i can give easy ways to ease the traffic problems. At the first place we need to ease the traffic problems and then think of eradicating it. Some sample suggesstions:  1) Uturn Management: where ever there is a uturn , the traffic is held up by rouge cab drivers occcupying all the lanes to take the u turn. All we need to do is setup a barricade  not to let them take that u turn unless they are in the right lane for it.  2) Bus bays: We need to create bus bays whereever they are not there. Using bus bays avoids the blockages by the BMTC buses near the bus stops. 3) Usage of Bus Bays: We are glad that we have bus bays in some areas. Unfortunately  none of the BMTC drivers use them. They fell that it is their right to block the road. Hosnetly if you set right the BMTC drivers by teaching them some road manners, 20% of Bangalore traffic issues will be resolved. Especially the Volvo drivers, just because they have a high end bus, they feel like they own the road. 4) Foot paths: Foot paths should be cleared of all the encroachments. Especially near the bus stops.   ETC ETC. A normal engineer working in Bangalore can give multiple suggesstions to de congest the city. Some dedication to implement them is all is needed.\n", "14- Answer to the plan is :  the prevailing traffic conditions are NOT new.

NOW.  by 2031 there will be no companies or jobs left in bangalore due to the pathetic infrastructure we have. People would prefer migrating to a different state where they can provide better infrastructure. Driving 2 hours to cover 7 kms is the state of roads and traffic we are in now and we are planning for 2031 ????  when the authorities couldn't solve issues all these years, what will they do in 2031? so, all this master plan seems so fake... and there is no substance in this. sorry. \n", "16- The earliar CDP has not been implemeted with respect to Road widening, and you change in the new CDP you have made broder just to harass without sintific approach and practically seeing the situation of the roads proposed width and where it statrs and ends.\n", "23- Join the remaining part of nice road to reduce the the traffic flow in City.\n", "25- Any new residential or commercial development needs to have traffic assessment done and approved. Approvals should consider infrastructure to accommodate new traffic generated by development and if infrastructure can handle it. Capability of the development to accommodate parking within itself should also be given prime importance.\n", "31- I am concerned about all the new construction and whether it will cause more traffic than is already there. BBMP has to find a way to do that somehow. \n", "34- A well implementation of discipline will help a better commuting.  1. Strict enforcement of traffic laws. 2. Parking/ No Parking Zones defined should be strictly controlled. 3. Enforce people to follow lanes strictly 4. Make roadside parking only with payment to BDA/ BBMP 5. Promote paid parking in areas where sufficient parking spaces are not available. Provide expert agencies to handle paid parking. 6. Traffic violators should be tracked - both vehicle number and licence number. 7. Recommend to increase the insurance premium in the subsequent premium payment for violators.  Implementation of these international rules will improve the journey speed.\n", "36- Land acquisition policy should be given 45 days deadline with immediate release of money to private owners or else inflation and appreciation value will be concern. And all contractors should come under transparent rating system and new contracts it should be awarded only if ranking improves.\n", "39- The last mile from metro needs to be addressed with different methods. One of them could be to provide huge 2 wheeler parking space at metro stations. We are predominantly a 2 wheeler majority country. If this characteristic of the population is used effectively, this can be a high impact solution to the traffic issue. People will start using metro by default, bringing down the traffic congestion.\n", "40- The most common sight on the road is of the slowest moving vehicles like autos, goods vehicles, LORRIES, CONTAINER LORRIES, All driving on the right side of the road. This causes a huge disrupsency to the traffic. The right side is for the fast moving vehicles. The slow moving traffic should stay on the left. Bangalore traffic does a good job to catch those vehicles that are overspeeding but what about those who go very slowly and cause traffic block to everyone else. That is equally important. Please fine the people causing traffic jams as well. Without these steps, our city will never be congestion free. It\u2019s a shame that the first thing that anyone relates to when they think of Bangalore is the traffic jams here. It\u2019s very sad to hear as a bangalore citizen. Without some strict actions being taken, we will spend most of our lives sitting in traffic jams and wasting time.   I am sure there will be good agencies available to help in finding ways to reduce traffic jams in our city. That is the need of the hour currently. Please take it seriously. \n", "52- Traffic is the biggest challenge for all Bangaloreans. The state government should work at a war footing speed to resolve the burning  problem we Bangaloreans face every day. The government apathy and insensitive further worsen the situation. \n", "60- The local BMTC count should not be increase so much. Karnataka Transport Department has proposed slab rates based on the cost of the car, this is not good. Government should not fix these rates I feel. We should try to make use the existing railway tracks to start local trains wherever possible with in Bangalore. Strict punishment or fine should be put on those who are breaking traffic rules. Government should make more Mobile apps and websites so that Public can post complaints if they see somebody breaking the traffic rules.\n", "62- Spending on ring roads and signal free corridors and ramp intersections is one thing, enforcing traffic rules and making sure that it is strictly followed is another. There needs to be more focus on better planned roads and pavements - yes but equal focus must be given towards improving traffic police conditions and more traffic patrolling to ensure that rules are followed. Stricter motor vehicle license tests and proper training for public transport vehicle operators, drivers and private cabs must be put in place along with clear speed limit signs throughout the road network. Not to forget clear lane markings, proper maintenance of roads and making sure that the road works are carried out effectively is also essential and severely lacking at the moment. Parking management is again very crucial. Illegal parking on junctions with underpasses and street markets that are illegally set up on pavements and other main roads must be discouraged with pro-activeness. Also, most new areas that are developed have no proper planning of roads - most cross roads are dead-ends and have no adequate connectivity. There must be properly designed footpaths for pedestrians to encourage local commute on foot for short trips. With dead-end roads without allowance for even foot journey, the most convenient choice is obviously personal vehicles. Lack of parking facilities means vehicles are parked on roads blocking traffic movement and hence more congestion. Restricting parking without providing alternatives is a pointless thing to do. Enforcing these basic things and emphasis on pedestrian and cycle commutes are a great way to build smart cities.\n", "65- Need strict implementation of obeying traffic rules, keeping the lane. Sometimes traffic signals causes jams. Every signal needs to be studied to see if it is causing jam, how many actual seconds of each lane traffic and pedestrian crossing is required. This can avoid unnecessary jams at the signals.\n", "70- Penalty for traffic offences should be increased at least 3-fold from present rates  to let the public know that they need to maintain traffic discipline.\n", "72- Majority of the traffic issues are due to poor driving skills and not following traffic discipline \n", "74- how is the current traffic situation being handled while new development happens? I already see the white topping and the metro development is triggering gaping holes and ensuring roads are clogged throughout the day.  Atleast, plan things in a way that all the development does not happen at once and you pick things up in parts. so that the impact is regionalised and people can opt for alternate routes.\n", "82- Adoption of smart traffic road\n", "87- Traffic problems make our lifes in HELL.Mainly this is due to the absense\\not assigned traffic polices in some areas .Traiffic polices present in main roads and can see them only in first and last week of every months(might be showing or meeting their targets)\n", "88- Despite what is the popular trend, the bulk of India's traffic is on two wheelers. Our climate allows it and it is also a good compromise on affordability and flexibility. What is critically important is to make the roads safer for two wheelers. Few suggestions: 1. Create two-wheelers only lanes on main roads. Do not allow cars or other heavy vehicles in those areas 2. No two wheelers allowed in other lanes. It is for their safety as well 3. Additional safety measures to prevent serious injuries from accidents - shatter proof strong plastic shield in front, storage baskets for luggage, bike lane limited to vehicles 200 CC or lesser\n", "89- Good traffic management\n", "90- You have ignored the prominent issues, There should be flyover from Hope farm till varthur kodi , also from Varthur kodi to cross Varthur. Its already saturated and government is planning to widen the road of varthur to varthur kodi. It will not solve the purpose. I think 1 flyover can solve this problem at varthur kodi junction.  Flyover from Hope farm till varthur kodi if you are thinking of future else it will be mess as you might build just bridge or underpass at hope farm, it will solve the short term problem not the long term. Density of popluation in whitefield working in IT/ITES/ manufacturing is quite high. You need to think ahead of 10 years.  I felt bad when i see the current situation where even 1 underpass at kundlahalli takes years . How will you achieve the infra problem.  There should be peripheral metro also to connect the city which will solve 2 problems traffic, pollution . Like - Whitefield to Electronic city, Electronic city to Nagwara, and hebal to whitefield. That is the only way to control the traffic mess.  You also need to implement other feeder systems like Rapid transport . I am sure people are ready to pay as we know the everyday struggle to reach to office.  Few proposals you should pay attention rather than discarding :)  1. Peripheral metro to connect the city as city expand , it will be more mess. That one should not ignore. ( This is the best solution to solve long term problem not the roads) 2. Build Nice road - Electronic city to Whitefield and whitefield to Hebal.  3. Flyover from hope farm to varthur kodi to Varthur  , It getting messier 4.Rapid transport - Pod taxis - ( it can be implemented at congested places)- Proposed but need some action on ground.  5. More training to traffic cops as i find them uneducated about the congestion of traffic.  6. Kundlahalli junction underpass pending from last 5 years ( if we cant build 1 flyover ,how we will improve the infra )  7. Underpass or overbridge at yamlur signal. Its not managable by traffic cops now. I am sure no one paid the attention also.  8. Tin factory - k.r. puram till 100 feet road indranagar, ( need to have less signals )   9.Also underpass at HAL signal ,ISRO signal and Leela palace . It is proposed but need to be implemented quickly otherwise it will loose its importance.    I stay in this part of city east part of city and travel to Indranagar from Whitefield.  These are few suggestions which you can look upon. \n", "92- With the plan on paper, it's a good plan. The the problem arises in the implementation of the plan. The progress speed and the quality of work provided. We should aim that whatever is being constructed now, may it be roads or anything should easily last for next 20 years.

Foot over bridges to b made with a different design and with less number of steps on all the major traffic prone roads - but shd see that invariably lift or escalator is installed failing which the purpose of making the bridge will b defeated.  2. Almost all the main junctions where 3 or 4 roads meet traffic signals are to b installed with proper syscronization and with sensors to automatically change the lights if traffic is less at any point of time . In addition to this there shd b pedestrian crossing signals which again will b syscronized with the main traffic signals. Lastly if at all they r planning to reduce the congestion , like in other countries flyovers are to b built in above the other to lead the traffic to different destinations \n", "133- Always getting stuck in traffic\n", "145- To avoid traffic Road should be widend also reducing unnecessary humps nd making sufficient parking \n", "149- The traffic authorities should also be involved actively to introduce penalties offences that are not currently in place. The authorities must also put an effort in booking the offenders. Lot of traffic jams happen because of lane disciplines not being followed, signals being jumped and people flouting many such traffic rules. Greater effort should be put in identifying such offences and the penalty amounts for such offences must be made very steep. The licenses of repeat offenders must be suspended. \n", "150- The focus should be on traffic flow rather than road widening which is a never ending cycle. If people drive in wrong direction and don't follow lanes for turning left or right then any length of width of roads is insufficient. There should be a drive to educate people and enforcement to follow traffic rules. The speed of vehicular movement is slowed down by unauthorized parking on any spot including near the turns, pedestrians crossing every where, vehicles coming in wrong direction, vehicle turning right from the left most lane and left from the right most lane leading to chaos on turnings, very slow movement on traffic signals, un-managed auto movements in every direction. The planned infrastructure looks good on paper but it cannot be sustained without people participation and for that discipline and enforcement is the basic need that is prevalent in every developed country except in India. The master plan should also include a chapter how they plan to handle this basic issue which will increase further with additional number of vehicles on road if not tackled properly. In that case any amount of modern infrastructure will just add to chaos on the roads.  Also, when granting permission to build multistory apartments on narrow lanes of the outer areas, capacity of the roads should be measured and only appropriate number of buildings be allowed or the road capacity should be increased beforehand as it is next to impossible to demolish and residential apartment or other buildings at a later stage and residents have to suffer the never ending traffic blockages throughout the day.  There is no mention of handling this issue in the plan. You may have multiple ring roads but if the roads connecting to these and and other major roads in the city are so congested it will take hours to reach the main roads from small narrow by lanes. There is no concept of parallel roads in Bangalore and everyone has to pass through same main road example outer ring road or Whitefield road and all other roads leading to these are very narrow.\n", "159- Roads need to maintain well then link roads may be help to control traffic wherever it is necessary...\n", "167- 1. If people/commuter can identify and alarm the system, for the offenders, a lot of violation can be taken care. e.g, I can capture (video etc.) and upload to the authority and they penalizes the offender, basis the offense done. This way a personnel need not be deployed on junctions and breathe smoke. 2. If the bus/auto stands can be moved out of roads, probably on an elevated station, out of the roads can avoid stopping/slowing of traffic, this can also help authority to do away of the speed breakers. 3. A lot of vehicles, mostly cab drivers, drives on high beam on their headlights which causes a lot of distraction for the fellow commuters. 4. Riders/Drivers should be educated on usage of horns, many honks without any reason and causes distress for the fellow commuters.  Can explain all these points and many more in details, if these are worth a workable points \n", "169- While so much is being done for us, we as a citizen should also have responsibility. What is the measure taken to stop citizens from following wrong traffic rules like going on one ways, talking on mobile while in a two wheeler, not following signals. How do we change the mindset. People only want to rush irrespective of what happens behind them. They have an attitude of I hv to move front, I am not bothered about the rest.

Strict enforcement of traffic rules and violaters should be penalized. 2. CCTV at all points and ward wise traffic control rooms, thereby minimising the physical need for traffic constables. 3. Educating all the drivers while procuring the license itself which should be made compulsory and visits to Hospital or video recording of accident victims. 4. Lane discipline should be followed. 5. Roads should be of good standards, proper warning to be displayed if there were some repairs of the roads or potholes. 6. Cases of traffic violation to be disposed off as soon as possible, long delay in judiciary is bound to embolden the offenders. 8. Roads should have prelaid pipes for cables and water or drain , or gas pipes, frequent digging to be avoided. 8.

What is the strategy to curb construction of multistory complexes and the  traffic generated by them adding chaos and traffic jams (example: Manyata park and other such IT complexes). In order to reduce congestion it is very important to decentralize the activity centers like whole sale markets, vegetable markets, other such activities. There is not much information of traffic management systems.\n", "181- Please put a traffic cameras to study the traffic conditions, all traffic lights timeouts should be based on real time feeds and not on time based timeouts, this only increases traffic, ensure that potholes are duly filled on time\n", "184- road dividers should not be opened in between to ramp up city speed. this in mid road dividers results in traffic due to no signals and no traffic controller.\n", "188- One way to check traffic\n", "190- Half of the traffic related problems can be solved simply by providing good, long-lasting roads, and by completing all ongoing infrastructure tasks in a time-bound fashion. \n", "197- The question is of quick evacuation of traffic & how. Vehicular population will keep growing. So, we need multi layer uninterrupted traffic flow underground. This is an expensive solution, but is good for the next 25-50 years. Longer distance traffic will not disrupt short distance vehicles & vice versa. Entries/exits can be planned every km. Availability of space is not an issue at all. All areas under existing roads can be used & more. We don't have to cut down trees. In addition gardens & playing areas, garbage disposal, sewage treatment etc can be planned. PLASTIC SHOULD DEFINITELY BE BANNED.\n", "212- Better management of traffic\n", "216- Poor management by traffic cops. They do not regulate traffic... they only stand in groups by the roadside,  chatting & drinking tea. They pounce on vehicles even if no rule is broken, & threaten with high fines, thereafter pressurise the drivers/owners to pay a lesser amount,  without receipts. If this style is stopped and they do their job sincerely,  traffic would improve considerably. It requires a sea change in attitude of an entire generation of cops.\n", "218- I know our cops are doing the best appreciate that but every one has to reach before time. It will be great if we follow the traffic like the other countries do follow a lane and continue the same till you cross the road and maintain a speed limit \n", "223- I am sure the responses for this segment would be in the thousands. Basics: 1. Remove illegal speed breakers and proper marking on Speed Breakers. Most breakers are not visible until you are almost upon them, especially at night 2.a. On major roads like the ORR, have a 3 ft hedge of shrubs on the divider. This will increase greenery, plus helps night driving as the opposite high beam does not blind drivers. Will reduce night accidents 2.b. Alternatively setup proper signals at major crossings like Kalamandir, JP Morgan, Oriental College etc., to ensure safe crossing for pedestrians. 3. Build FOB at all major pedestrian crossings and setup grills on the divider (at least 150m on each side of the FOB) in the middle to ensure pedestrians will definitely take the FOB 4. Monitor and close gaps forcibly created in dividers by 2 wheelers for a quick U turn. 5. Have small (fixed traffic cone type) dividers setup near turns so that those who need to turn will go into the correct lane and not obstruct the traffic going straight by occupying all the lanes 6. Remove the compulsory helmet rule as it is only facilitating traffic cops to make a quick buck. Taking care of their safety is the rider's responsibility and not the traffic department's. The seat belt and helmet rules are useless in the current Indian mindset. The cops should instead focus on stopping and penalizing those who break other traffic laws like jumping a red light, driving in the opposite lane, etc. as these could prove harmful to other drivers who are following traffic rules. 7. Use good quality material for tarring or white-topping roads, so that they last longer and allow traffic to flow smoothly. I feel that at least 40% of the traffic jams in Bengaluru will be avoided, if the roads are in good condition.\n", "226- I feel the law enforcement is very low in Bangalore overall, for example when a commercial complex is built, no measure taken by the BBMP or BDA before approving it, least bothered about the parking space is available for the multi storied buildings, the residents end up parking on the footpaths and on the roads, you can see this culture everywhere in bangalore, people build independent houses but park their cars/bikes on the roads, there is no safety measures taken for the people walking, they are forced to walk on the roads risking their safety. What about elders and kids, where they walk? where are the footpaths? even a medical shop puts their bill board on the footpath, footpaths are not meant for people to walk, I think this is a serious issue in Bangalore. I do not see this point in your master plan.\n", "231- Need to plan all constructions properly as the entire city is dugged up throughout the year. The condition of roads cause more traffic and traffic police needs to be more strict with people not obeying traffic rules.\n", "235- Our Traffic system is in a pathetic state. Average peak hour speed between 8:30am-11:30am is about 10-12kms/hr.  Firstly I do not blame the government alone for this problem as citizens are equally responsible for this as we do not follow even the basic traffice rules and common sense is just thrown out of the window when we are in the driving seat, but we should also recognise much of the problems need government to take first initiatives.  So what I propose is that, better traffic management and augmented common services are need of the hour.  1. Traffic violations should be severely dealt with with Impounding of vehicle for weeks or months and the safe keep cost added to fines. Community services should be made part of the fine and repeat violators should be subjected to naming and shaming.  2. Methods should be divised to improve lane driving diciplin and specific training and orientation for 2 wheeler drivers.  3. Corporates occupying large office complexes should be encouraged to devise staggered reporting times for employees to ensure less number of  vehicles at a give time. Further Corporates should also be encouraged to work towards a 30% population of employees working from Home on any give day, unless absolutely required to work from office. Having been in Corporates for 22 years I am confident that it is possible if they try, yes it will have some cost impact but I am confident it will only improve the productivity, which effectively can offset some additional cost.  4. Management and coordination of our shared commute modes like bus and metro needs to improve. Metro where available is a boon but Feeder bus and general bus commute still takes a long time. Traveling on ORR or Richmond road averages between 5-10kms/hr most of t he time during the day, this needs to improve dramatically.  5. Quality of roads are PATHETIC.  However to be positive I believe white topping should improve situation and needs to be done much faster pace, plastic based mix for interior roads should become a norm. And most of all contractors doing the road or civic works should be held accountable which is not the case leading to awful patchwork that doesn't even last a month.  \n", "239- Metro work is too delayed and till the time it will be completed there will be chaotic situation in the city, pollution and traffic is already at peak, how are we going to deal till then?\n", "240- Building roads alone will not fix the traffic issue.

In the absence of a strong public transport system , people rely on their private vehicle clogging the roads and resulting in wasted time, fuel, pollution and stress. This approach can continue forever without crippling bengaluru for ever.  While Metro contrsuction will take another decade to complete to cater to a significant chunk of the road traffic.. in the interim there is a need to implement  Introduction of BusLanes : For faster movement of BMTC buses on major roads  like ORR ,so that residents can make the shift to public transport.

Engineer and contractor to be held responsible for finished roads, for upto 3 years.\n", "54- All deisel vechiles and buses should be immeditly replaced either with CNG or electric buses/cars/scooters, This is creating huge pollution in traffic. Metro rail work should speed up with frequent connectivity to all TECH parks either on road or underground nearly 50per traffic will be controlled. People should be encouraged more to use public trasnport and also Banglore should come up with a policy for all pvt Companies to mandidatorily use public services than individual pvt vehicles.  \n", "55- No matter how many metro will be constructed, according to data, everyday 122 to 1600 new vehicle registrations happen in Bangalore. Personal cars should be mandated for pooling and no single travel per car.\n", "59- 1.   Choose atleast 6 roads running north to South (one example KAMARAJ Road which runs from Chandapurar in south to other end or north Bangalore) and 6 roads running East to West (Example M.G. Road running from Hoskote to Nelamangala) making a square net work.  2.   Declare TDR and give a good rate of not less than 3 times the Land area and even upto 4 or 5 times to lure land owners to easily opt for vacating and surrendering the Land. The bureaucrats are spoiling the scheme by suggesting 1.25/ 1.5 etc as if the Government is paying from its own pockets. 3.    Please expand the Roads to 200 Ft. wide 16 to 20 lane roads, with continuous signal free  provisions for vehicles to freely and quickly move. All cross roads to be over or under these 150 Ft. wide roads. This is the cheapest and positive way of solving traffic since it does not cause the exchequer much as compared to Bridges and Flyovers. Every one will immediately after leaving their houses heading for their destination, will take one of these 200ft roads and exit from these roads at  the nearest point of destinations. 4.   While acquiring land  Please make provision for additional land to create parking infrastructure at several places.  5. These Roads should provide for minimum 8 = 8 lanes of preferably 10 = 10 lanes in which devoted lanes for police and ambulance vehicles, separate lanes for public transport vehicles including KSRTC and BMTC vehicles should be made.  \n", "75- Traffic rules not enforced. Two wheelers are the worst violators. Wrong side driving,no helmet, unlicensed youngsters driving with 3 or more passengers, signal violatio etc. ,Violation occurs in front of policemen. \n", "76- Smaller electric buses from metro stations will help to meet last mile connectivity issues\n", "94- Firstly the traffic condition in our city is going worse. I think people are getting into our city more and more as time goes by. Well, it's high time for us to use electric vehicles. In this era the technology is being developed so well that I feel it's high time for us to shift to the eco friendly vehicles.. HEMP also produces fuel to the vehicle where the environment wouldn't be polluted so there is no need of petrol because it creates too much pollution compared to hemp fuel. Please government, please do take HEMP very seriously. IT CSN CHANGE THE ENTIRE WORLD.\n", "96- Should reduce the police checking in every corners.. that makes lot of traffic blocks as well. And build parking areas as well .. so that people won't park on roadside.. \n", "100- Plan share vehicle policies for people traveling in same direction and start odd even day policy for 4 wheeler vehicle holders.\n", "112- Mini buses should be introduced by BMTC to cater around all metro rail stations within radius of 3 to 5 km.so that it can cover all narrow roads.This will reduce the noice and other polutions of auto and two wheelers,.if CNG or electric mini buses are used.\n", "131- Discourage private vehicle use. Improve public transport systems. Revive 2 way traffic wherever feasible.(London roads are narrow but traffic is 2 way). Rationalise 1 way traffic directions - e.g. - interchange 1 way directions of Margosa & Sampige roads, Malleshwaram. Provide emergency vehicles lane across city bypassing congested zones. Bar hawkers from roads. Implement traffic rules with CCTV surveillance. Encourage bicycles with dedicated lanes. Provide pedestrian space, ensure safety.\n", "141- Well, Bangalore is growing tremendously without any doubt. But still proper Engineering is required to avoid traffic. Proper flyovers underpass metro stations etc.\n", "156- Please do not even consider building one way flyovers. Public transport needs to improve heavily.\n", "158- Why don\u2019t MNC companies stop giving parking slots for the employees who are getting their own cars and ask them to use public transport or car pooling.\n", "168- Plan is good but it has to be implemented on warfooting as everyday I spend around 3 to 4 hrs only in commuting\n", "194- Metro, Bus, Rail have to be integrated.. looking at current metro plan, wonder if any detail plan have been done as bus stations and rail stations are not integrated ..and commuters are forced to walk across with their luggage. So integration is important. 2. Keep cost of mass transport affordable (don't look at profit always).. by keeping cost, utilization will go up and this will automatically result in profit by increase volume and utilization and also traffic mess will be solved automatically. No mention of technology is seen here.. use sensors, cameras and intelligent traffic systems to streamline traffic, synchronize traffic lights and also have good pedestrian system. Most important, penalize traffic offenders heavily.. and without any corruption line Singapore and other countries. Drunken driving should result in minimum 10 years jail or more.. and traffic courts should function super efficiently and quickly.. \n", "198- I agrer with the points mentioned in documents mentioned above. But we should look and think out of the box to reduce traffic. Bengaluru is having very good channel of Rail Tracks. Its just we are not looking or considering that channel. We can  think of running local trains between stations on at least hourly or half hourly basis (like Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai etc.). This will reduce traffic on roads and will not incur extra costs of maintaining roads. Day by day population is increasing in Bengaluru. Local trains will help a lot not only today but in future also to reduce road traffic. \n", "203- The bridges should be integrated.  The bottlenecks/Slow moving places should be identified.  The signals should be integrated.  100% Camera surveillance should be implemented.  The local transport timing should be strictly implemented with technologies like GPS, cashless ticketing, IOT etc., which will enable to reduce the no. of individual vehicles in the city.  Online payment of toll gate should be implemented.  Speed breakers should be minimized scientifically.  Traffic violation should be handled strictly \n", "207- We need congestion charges on private vehicles like London has. No private vehicle can enter the core areas of the city without paying these congestion charges. This will help curb vehicles on important roads.  The metro needs accountability and last mile connectivity. Public cycle sharing systems should work like magic.  Moonshoots like pod taxis are a waste of the tax payers money and should be abandoned as soon as possible\n", "228- We could have separate lanes for two wheelers and others so two wheelers green signals can start a few seconds earlier and then for the rest.  This is being used in Chandigarh for cycle rickshaws. \n", "233- Please consider the following input to be included in the  Revised Master Plan(RMP) 2031, if you think it is relevant.  In Bangalore,  wherever we go, we find cable TV wires or internet wires loosely hanging on road sides from electric/telephone posts or trees. These cables are laid either by cable TV operators or internet companies. Cables are haphazardly pulled through tree tops and telephone/electric posts to houses/buildings. The left over or unused wires are rolled and kept hanging loosely. Among these there are plenty of unused wires, broken ones dangling touching heads of pedestrians. A child running carelessly or a two wheeler can get entangled with these wires and fall. These companies do not care to remove the old wires/unused wires, laid by them.    To me it seems, at the present scenario, none of the service providers have a secure stable method of carrying the overhead wires to consumers, other than using electric posts/telephone and trees. A stable infrastructure will be useful for both the companies and to their customers  Otherwise, in the years to come such wires will be on the increase creating mayhem, inconveniencing residents, pedestrians and vehicle drivers.     Suggest BBMP or any other agency to provide a permanent/stable infrastructure or  a special  bay for accommodating such cables/wires and rent it out to service providers.  None should be allowed to use electric post or trees for laying cables or internet  wires. You may consider including this item in the master plan, if not already included under any other heads.  Thanking you.  \n", "234- Please invest in building dedicated safe cycle tracks through out the city. Road/ traffic / parking problems will all become easy to solve. Imagine public taking cars for office a km away just because there are no footpaths or cycle paths and in turn causing , miles of traffic pile up on bad roads. One solution will solve many problems. Please lower your commission/profit targets and give citizens a chance to better life.\n", "251- could have combine near by IT companies transportation.for example L&T,Mindtree,UST all near bu companies.they all are using third party cab services.but independent cab services for each company.in each maximum 2 or 3 employers will be ther.My suggestion is Why cant we club near by IT companies transportation.anyhow companies workings time and all almost same.so if we can club the transportation atlset the cab will be full,less traffic,cost can share among by these IT companies . \n", "260- One of the major problems faced in Bangalore is parking. Regardless of how well our roads are laid and how much effort our policemen put to regulate traffic, the basic need to park our car doesn't exist in Bangalore. People even park on busy roads and immediately jam traffic. It is important that BDA places high priority in identifying parking garages near Metro stations and bus terminals. Without which, any public transport system is bound to fail. Since public transport is not a door to door facility, it's important to help people park their vehicles safely while they avail the public transport. If these are rolled into a Metro payment card, it will enhance the attractiveness of taking public transportation.   The other area where BDA and our BTP can help with is to understand traffic patterns and proactively managing traffic lights. In many cases, until and after traffic piles up, people park haphazardly and drive erratically causing the traffic jams. Then when the traffic is piled up, cops try to sort it out. If we have policemen on beats ensuring vehicles are moving along and not blocking traffic early in the day, it could definitely help. \n", "262- Reducing the 4 vehicle usage may reduce the traffic and increase the metro lines. bus transportation should be increased\n", "263- There be some Bus only routes and entire city to be covered by electric only buses. connectivity is a big issue in city and to airport and need to be properly connected possibly with open roof electric buses.\n", "287- The following are basic reasons for traffic problems in the city:  1. Quality of roads 2. Non accountability of contractors for poor roads 3. Constant digging of roads 4. Poor patch work of roads 5. Delay in inspection of roads and hence greater damage 6. Lack of incentive to use public transport 7. Poor last mile connectivity 8. Major surge in taxi operators and hence 4 wheelers 9. Non existence of limiting vehicle ownership policy 10. Upsurge in 2 wheeler traffic 11. Lack of incentive to walk 12. Existence of corridors of converging traffic and narrowing roads 13. Traffic police is busy fining people than controlling traffic  Here are possible solutions to the above points:  1. Public Accountability of the contractor and the office responsible to ensure road quality - timely inspection and repair, minimum time guarantee being imposed,  usage of apps with location to be able to tag the location of problem and response mechanism along with auto escalation matrix   2. Build and Incentivise public transport use to major hubs of traffic movement - this includes safe and regular last mile connectivity options, incentivising walking via well kept footpaths, overhead bridges, cycle routes. Without last mile, people will still use private transport or autos and taxis   3. Phase out 3 wheelers and introduce 4 wheeler autos - the driving behaviour can be curtailed this way  4. Dedicated bus lanes and non private transport areas within the city - de congest rings to increase public transport utilisation  5. Phase out privately owned 2 wheelers. Only logistics organisations can own them. Provided subsidised public transport usage to this part of public.   6. Private organisations to be forced to implement no 2 wheeler policy.   7. Employ strict policing mechanisms to ensure smooth traffic flow. Move to digitally secure payments to disband bribes, AI And visual tech for infringement identification, safety driving mechanisms such as high pricing of insurance for drivers based on driving style  8. Identification of traffic flow to specific locations such as tech parks and regulate time of travel. E.g Manyata tech park can operate only after 11 am, while ITPL can operate starting 7 am. These can split peak traffic load  9. Relocation of tech parks to separate small townships that encompass a complete habitat. Will cause responsible development of the area. SEZs need to be identified to incentivise movement, affordable development to be undertaken \n", "290- Public transport should be strengthened and incentivise people who are using public transport by means of tax waiver etc. Interconnectivity with different modes of transport must be made efficient. Footpaths and sky walks should be made GU i\n", "291- Each shopping area should have multi level car parking. Also all metro stations should have parking for 200-500 cars\n"], "Footpaths and bike paths will also be constructed on the road\n": ["11- Make smooth dust free widened road for bangalore as per population growth.Pathetic plans need to be reviewed\n", "13- Planning of road every thing should change I have a plan \n", "21- Problem: Main problem is BMTC stops on main roads. They stop anywhere and do rash driving. Suggestion: Construct nice bus stops every 5km with bicycle to rent. No stop of BMTC bus every few meters on main road. Strictly follow lane rules Better to have seperate road oy for BMTC bus. \n", "45- Especially for ladies there should be separate lane for driving zone and gents also separate driving zone. it will be helpfull for smooth driving. \n", "48- There is no mention of multi level parkings being planned. BDA owns so many buildings and if properly planned they could add atleast 2 floors of parking which could save space on the road. Currently we see 30% of the road used for parking\n", "57- Sir / Madam  The plan is good but it is mentioned for only ring road where in we have lots of traffic problem  in ulsoor area also the roads are narrow  and now it has become four side lane road so is their any possibility to look into the expansion of road in ulsoor area near the gurdwara\n", "67- I am not giving feedback on the masterplan. I am just giving my opinion. Actually new houses are being built with 3+ floors without any car parking and the tenants are parking on the road which causes a big inconvenience to the residences. Road is for driving and not parking. Why can't they build a house with car parking. Why is the BBMP silent on these matters?. \n", "80- Tree conservation and road expansion doesn't hold good together. How do they maintain a balance? And more sky walks on fast moving roads such as Ring Roads and Airport roads along with barricades on the divider. \n", "81- Repair and better quality roads must be laid. To have a porthole free road in Bangalore must be priority one of any administration. Garbage collection and prevention of dumping materials and garbage on roads and public area. \n", "85- Roads must be we'll maintained and no promise regarding that has been given and must be ensured so that private cars also don't face any hassle\n", "97- Parallely, we need to work on existing infrastructure also. Make a person on a self driven wheel chair the datum. He should be able to independently move around. Do our pavements and pedestrian crossings comply to this requirement?   Lane marking and signage to indicate, which lane to be maintained for the next turn/straight. Also mark out parking places on the road side.  Zebra crossings are mostly non-existent. Where they are, they end in a fence or a bush in the divider. Stop lines at red lights with the word STOP not marked.   Level of assurance of a penalty needs to be much higher. Presently it is so low that people can break the law and get away with it. We need to reduce the probability of getting away.   Doing future planning and creating new infrastructure is all good. But first take care of the existing.   Our biggest hinderance to traffic woes is the rate of traffic movement at a junction. We need to work towards increasing the average speed on a green light. Case in point being Marathahalli Bridge. There is no Red light, and the traffic is still clearing very slowly. Address problems like these first.\n", "103- This is good , but there is also a problem of signalling . It would be more helpful if signals are replaced by roundabouts like in Brazil , and the remaining signals be synchronised to avoid multiple stops on the same stretch of road \n", "123- All these things are required and very good vision from the government. But construction of flyovers must be considered as the cause of delays are more because of jams at the road intersection / junction. More and more flyovers should be made.\n", "129- Separate walkway for pedestrians and separate road for 2 wheelers should be provided in order to safeguard the people and avoid accidents which  also reduces traffic jams. And also cycling should be promoted more to reduce air pollution.\n", "155- Along with traffic need to control how permission is given to construct new places with no amenities to park the traffic is a major issue that would also mean enough roads\n", "160- The roads are very narrow and the vehicles are so more that the road gets blocked and it gets jammed at Hebbal flyover...not only here but many other place and too...so firstly I would like to suggest to widen the roads \n", "187- Traffic and good roads go in parrallel, unscientific speed breakers need to be removed and regularized properly.

I would want to plant lot's of trees. \n", "219- Wide roads are required in the residential areas around the IT tech parks. For example the Panathur main road which is the main connectivity road in the ECO space outer ring road is very narrow and this leads to daily traffic jams.\n", "221- Footh paths are a MUST. We have so much pedestrian traffic but no proper walking spaces designated to just pedestrians. It will encourage people to walk more if the foothpaths are maintained well leading to less congestion, and yes expansion of roads, properly planned flyovers to tackle the monstrous travel time within the city.\n", "225- Traffic is a big topic  Here i only mentioning about road condition Most of the roads are in very bad condition with dangerous path hole  Need a concerned person to have survey give them the ETA and fix asap if not fixed by the concerned team penalise them and make this process transparent  Evry area should have the concerned person details mentioned somewhere in that area to let prople know and easily complaint about tbe road condition\n", "232- Firstly the space allocated to roads, dividers, footpath are inadequate. For main arterial roads they should be 6 lane. The divider should be wide enough to provide for additional lane at crossing signals for right turning vehicles while there should be free left turning lane separating before turning and merging gradually with main traffic after turning. Secondly, lane discipline should be enforced and offenders to be booked with heavy penalty. Cameras at all crossings for monitoring and speed cameras in long stretches are must. Thirdly, all humps must be painted black and white for easy visibility. Footpaths should be cleared of vendors, transformers, uncovered drains so that padestrians do not have to walk on the road slowing traffic. Fourthly more skywalks on busy roads with escalators for senior citizens and differently abled. Fifthly, separate fenced lanes for two wheelers and making all major roads out of bound for autorickshaws.\n", "250- Love the idea of foot paths and cycle paths.

Along with this, the roads especially at the traffic signal junctions should be in good conditions, as I have observed the stretch of the road will be more or less good, but exactly after the signal, the roads will be dug up or have pot holes, which tends for slow exit of traffic from the signals.. this condition is in many signals. Another request is to ban old/Vehicles with more pollution, inhaling more exhaust of the vehicle while cycling becomes difficult.\n", "275- Traffic is the main concern in Bangalore. and also road pavement should be good.\n", "286- Details are missing. Badly designed roads. ORR has bus stops on the main road and the service roads are not used properly. Exit from ORR and entry into ORR through the same exit point is a blunder in design.

Traffic during these transition must be managed properly.\n", "10- Bangalore is unique in the sense that it has so many one way roads. Suddenly, on one fine day, the road gets converted to one way. What about building bridges? What about building underpasses/overpasses for pedestrians crossing on these ring roads? What's the plan to unclog major residential areas such as Hennur, Indira nagar, koramangala, Marathahalli which are seeing increasing traffic congestions? Why can't we impose no entry for big commercial vehicles?\n", "26- Road quality has to be ensured when giving contracts to contractors . All agencies like BWSSB, BBMP, KPTCL, traffic police , Namma metro have to work together to ensure newly laid roads are not digged . There should be ban of minimum 18 months once a road is relaid . This should ensure better coordination among these agencies .\n", "37- Bengaluru badly require a cycling track from btm to itpl to check pollution, traffic and also it keeps people fit\n", "56- When new roads are built, then proper Lane signs are to be drawn. The same as well should be done for existing roads. Following Lane discipline should be followed as a strict rule for all drivers. BMTC bus drivers must be highly educated on following disciplines. Majority are traffic pile up starts in the Bus stops. Bus drivers should following exact timings on when the trip should start, to avoid ending up with 4-5 busses at the same time in a single bus stop. The roads should be widened along the bus stops with dedicated space for buses to pick/drop passengers. Private buses should not be given permission to conducted bus services. They stop whenever and wherever they want to pick passengers, which adds more fuel to the traffic chaos.\n", "63- As the bangalore population keeps on increasing we need to focus on proper usage of existing road infrastructure. Heavy rules and fines  need to be imposed on people not following it. Infrastructure need to be made to support rules. Make mini BMTC buses to easy maneuverability. Have good lane discipline. Create right infra to avoid traffic on merging and dividing traffic. Put more traffic places in high congestion areas all over bangalore. \n", "64- As long as there is an inconsistency on road widths (lanes), you will be creating bottle necks. Which are one of the major cause of traffic. Similarly every major junction, flyover, underpass, bridge, signal.... a bus stop is provided right after or before these places. public stand covering half of the road, then autos stand at bus stops, forcing buses to stop in middle of the road... all this adds to the traffic snarls.  In addition to these proper pedestrian crossings are not provided to public, forcing them to take risky route to cross. Even after all this problem wont be solved, unless proper education is not given to citizen. Hope these suggestions help Bengaluru in making a world class city\n", "83- It should be made mandatory for all BMTC buses to stop only at the designated bus shelter. the drivers should be strictly penalized for stopping at the wrong place. Automatic card reader should be installed at the front door and only from the front door the passengers must alight the but and get down from the rear side\n", "86- Plz stick with your plan for traffic free Bangalore and  you must expand local area too \n", "93- Roads are not good, speed breakers are not required because pot holes are doing the job well, this all makes the traffic slow, and road jams. No lighting, I was surprised a day seeing a street in Koramangala with no street lights.   If road will be well, traffic will run fast and there will be no jams.  Bangalore is pathetic city in India in terms of traffic management and roads development.\n", "95- My feedback is on metro people traffic. I recently saw a video on how people are stuffed into metro carriages...I feel it's a safety issue.... we need to get double decker metro trains from Silk Board to electronic city and from Silk Board to marhathahalli. we the the traffic from these IT zones will be crazy...we need to plan and get double decker trains for these routes. these double decker trains are currently available in Sydney Australia already. \n", "106- Setting up metros,more buses etc all are a great initiative however when lane discipline isn't maintained the traffic congestion is bound to happen.Lane disciple does not only mean the vehicle movement in a single lane but also parking if buses in allocated bus stops.illogical u turns made by commuters.Lane discipline should be enforced as a hard n fast rule and fines slapped to the impatient drivers \n", "110- Please fast track the metro project. All the new buses inducted in this city should be all electric and phase out the existing BMTC buses and allow only electric buses for environment goodness. By 2031 no cars on Bangalore's street should be of fossil fuel users. I think mtero connectivity is very necessary to resolve traffic problem. Try to connect all the areas with metro.   And one most important thing all the new metro project should be under ground PLEASE. This is good for environment.  One other way to resolve traffic issues is by scalling up the adjacent  small cities of Bangalore. Don't over crowed Bangalore likes of Delhi Kolkata and Mumbai. Please.\n", "120- Buses actually cause more traffic jam\n", "138- Put a rule that single person can't travel in car during traffic hours \n", "142- No proper roads, cabs parks where ever they want, that creates traffic jam\n", "144- Ramamurthinagar nagar Channasandra bridge is a known place for traffic jam and there was a plan proposed for parallel bridge but it is not initiated .  Even other areas like KR PURAM , MARATHAHALLI , \n", "147- A railway under pass required in kanaka nagar area, nearly  30000 vehicles run every day the road connecting veerannapalya mayata tech park and RT Nagar which is creating huge traffic jam for hours when the railway gate is closed. \n", "163- 1. Metro work should be expedited. Its a very slow process which is actually the main cause of traffic. Area which needs the metro to be completed fast. eg near the whitefield phase to be completed on priority While the work is being done, there has to be alternate plans for diverting the traffic which the govt should have planned for. Every Metro phase completion atleat takes 5-6 years. I guess, we should have done a better job there.   2. The BBMP work on the road repairs is again pain point. the repairs takes 2-3 months to complete. We do not see people working at all no matter at what time of the day you come in there. (eg: JP nagar. signal Near Nandini hotel). Same is the case with laying a drainage line. does it really take 2 months to complete?  3. Closing all the potholes to be done much early in the year. this activity is take up just before the rains  and it hardly lasts for 3 -4 monts.  \n", "165- Increasing BMTC busses to 15K will surely help public transport domain, but on the other hand this will lead to traffic blocks. As you see Outer Ring Road and most of  the roads in Bangalore, 80% of the traffic is caused by BMTC busses as they don't follow the rules.  Lets take ORR first, BMTC bus stops are on the roads. These busses does not moved to the sides when they stop. During peak traffic hours, even if the bus stop on the side on the ORR, there will be huge traffic congestion.  One solution for the problem is to make ORR free from BMTC busses, and to have proper connective of service roads in ORR. Once that's done, all BMTC busses  can run via service roads and make free traffic flow on ORR. This will help to reduce traffic to a great extend \n", "171- These BMTC buses always stops at diagonal of the road blocking all the traffic, yes ALL the traffic that too at junction which is very painful. You dont need to wait till 2031 or new busstation to fix this small issues as it needs small education and tight monitoring of the driver patterns.\n", "186- Build parking places at crowded areas, Bus stops should be shifted from main road to inside lanes wherever possible so the main traffic doesn't stop. Strict action for blocking traffic for private buses and cabs. Most cabs are parked on roads which causes congestion. Encourage public transport by increasing bus/volvo connectivity. Right now there is no proper connectivity on Old madras road from TC palya. Make new roads via tech parks and societies wherever possible, only 2 entry exit roads to whitefield is causing sever issues while commuting to office.\n", "199- Pl pay attention to pedestrians by providing underpasses at almost every junction, road crossings. We also need to have bmtc bus stands at least 100 meters away from traffic junction and it must be made compulsory for buses so stop at bus stops and not elsewhere. All vehicles including autos taxis should park at least 100 meters away from junction.  Alternate  routes near main routes need to be widened and developed to decongest the traffic. \n", "204- Traffic management should be organised. Lane disciplines, usage of skywalkers should be made mandatory. BMTC and all private buses should stop only at dedicated bus stops. Bus stops should be made in an extended portion of the roads. No stops should be allowed next to signals, next to start and end of flyovers or next to cross sections.\n", "208- 1. Whenever cleaning happens, the waste is laid out in dumps on the footpath.  2. The bus almost never stops at the bus  stop. They will stop just after  the signal causing all sorts of honking and all by the drivers behind.  3.Roads not wide enough (and tech parks after tech parks on the same outer ring road).  4. There was flyover construction work(digging for a pillar) at Ejipura signal. Now there is no work for past 15 days but the still the barriers are there, making the road a single lane road just after the signal. The flyover will take 2,3 years to complete atleast. Will the road be still half closed till then?  5. Please take strict actions against bike driving on footpaths, going on the wrong side just to save 100m or so.  6. Strict action against jaywalking, especially when people crossing road under a overbridge. Eg. Marathalli overbridge, Domlur overbridge. Also, more and more overbridges are needed.\n", "213- Looks good on infrastructure on paper. The designs of all underpasses over bridges, flyovers are very bad, no proper access, access and exit at midway of wide roads explains lack of knowledge of BBMP on design. The entire plan should be designed by leading designers, and strict supervision by design firm on execution by BBMP.  The traffic staff unaware of rules, more often chat with colleagues at traffic intersections All traffic staff should be trained by competent training firms with authority to suggest unsuitable staff to BBMP. BBMP should commit to this with suitable action on inefficient staff. \n", "214- Kindly complete all Metro Phase works at the earliest by having connectivity for entire city. Connect long stretch metros like Devanahalli to Majestic,  Majestic to Whitfield, ITPL/ Sarjapur/Marathahalli to Bypanahalli, MG Road to Electronic City/Hosur, Electronic City to Devanahalli, Nagwara/ehlanka to MG Road etc  Secondly remove all outstation bus stations like Madivala to some empty/unused grounds.   Third - Proper management of traffic signal as apt for the hour rather going for automatic mode where it waste lots of peoples time who waits unnecessarily in signals without having any importance if waiting when there isn't any movements of vehicle in opposite direction.   Fourth - Stop all festival/wedding/house/political/commercial events related stuffs to be conducted on roads by blocking the same.  Fifth - Categorize company into different parts and one catagory should follow one day of the week compulsory to avoid taking there personal vechiles on road with also giving leverage of 1 hr late punch in the morning as they need to commute in metro/bus only.  \n", "217- Kindly include a bus timetable in bus stops\n", "224- The problem of Bangalore roads is that we have very few main roads and invariably the whole traffic comes to these roads. We should identify these roads and sub-roads and categorize them as A,B,C... etc . Each category road should have a template. Ex A category being highest should be something like, it should be  1. One way road. 2. 2 lane road. 3. Signal Free. 4. After every few kilometers it should have a system where traffic can take turns into any 4 direction. 5. Entry into these roads from B and lower category roads to be restricted and should have very well defined way of merging traffic. 6. Heavy penalty on drivers who break rules on these A category roads.  Same way we can form guidelines for other category roads and see to it that when a road is categorized it follows these guidelines.  \n", "229- remove bottlenecks on ORR, 5 KMs takes 40 min .1)expand service roads near flyovers 2) remove divider between service road and main road 3)create bus bays which are NOT right on the road but inside 4) create sky tracks for bicycles over the road dividers 5) Put metro for entire ORR 6) create flyover near KR puram to connect ORR and from old madras rd near new underpass 7) create flyover for ORR traffic to pass through KR puram 8) create alternative diagonal roads for critical junctions 9) sky walks need to be many more with escalators which are in working condition 10) complete PRR , ASAP with traffic speed target of 100 kmph. 11) connect Electronic city , Sarjapur , Whitefield via Budigere and second airport entrance near Begur. \n", "238- The entire Outer Ring Road of Bangalore should have multiple levels of speedways connecting the South to East to North. Traffic coming from Silk board to Hebbal should be made a speed way & like wise traffic coming from Hebbal to Whitefield. Make that a Paid Toll Speed way across the city - which will avoid traffic to a very large extend. More over the usual road infrastructure need to also improve drastically.  \n", "244- Just increasing the BMTC buses will not help, these are the reason also for congestion as roads are narrow. Please look for mini bus options, frequency can be increased. Also improve the connectivity with Metros/ long route transport by using buses as efficient feeders only not to compete with them. Please make it convenient that people feel tempted to leave their cars and use public transport, currently majority of Metro goers are those who switched from 2 wheelers or buses, not from cars because of the inconvenience and not because they're not willing to.\n", "246- Immediately the Intercity Buses to be stopped coming inside the city, needs to be feed from some place taken on hire basis & get feed through Public Transport\n", "252- In City Neverdays More traffic, Above you mention that BMTC Buses will be increase to 15000, but i don't think that it will work, because if More buses is there in city than traffic will be more not less, if our government can do the work like, Richmond Road Bridge they can connect to K R Market Bridge because whoever want to go to Mysore Road they can go easily,  And main is Corporation Circle near Halsuru Traffic Police Station, in this area traffic is more, government have to take some action for traffic issue.............\n", "269- Traffic congestion is one of the biggest problem Bengaluru is facing as of now. Please focus on to the Solution which improves the traffic.\n", "281- Roads are completely logged... both in weekdays and weekends... we really need to do something really fast!

Multi-modal concept is missing, which will promote people to easily switch between modes of transport including last mile connectivity using auto/2W.\n", "12- Please have wider roads and dont allow vehicles to be parked on main/service roads.\n", "42- Rather than stopping vehicle in the middle of the road and taking key from the vehicle Traffic police should me more friendly to all.But in the same they should be strict and should impose huge fines to one and all who violates traffic rules. Allow BMTC and department  approved vehicles during peak time which will reduce traffic upto an extent Put more buses on track where it feels more commuters traveling.\n", "46- Need a quick effort from the authorities. I recommend taking a drastic action to reduce the number of vehicles in the city (including the peripheral roads) by the following recommendations: 1) impose a restriction / heavy permit charge for vehicles entering the city area 2) introduce more buses and streamline the flow - make the buses also bound by laws, dedicated bus lanes, no overtaking, speeding etc. 3) restrict movement of large vehicles, but prioritize those needed to move the infra development effort faster\n", "58- We have necessary traffic rules but the public does not have the discipline to follow the rules. Driving license is given to people who have no understanding of traffic rules. and road signs. Parked vehicles take away half of some of our narrow roads. It is extremely frustrating to commute every day to work and back with many hours stuck in traffic  in highly polluted roads. Can we encourage our young people to use bicycles but also provide safe road to ride. I find it extremely difficult to cross a road. The vehicles are not aware of the Zebra lines. Pedestrians do get injured by vehicles.   A patient in an Ambulance has to be considered as the V V V V I P - all vehicles no matter who is in it should give way to the Ambulance.  \n", "66- Safety of pedestrians should be given utmost importance, which is not the case today in Bangalore. All roads in the city must have continuous footpaths. No road in the city shall be built without footpaths (in places where there is a need for walking). Footpath should be included as a primary part of road construction. It should be like, road = road for vehicles + footpath. Please see the examples from developed countries. If you take up Germany as an example, a person can walk safely and without getting mud on the shoes almost anywhere in German cities. City development should be from a pedestrian first approach. Only then will people try to use public transport more. There should be safe road crossing facilities in all roads at locations where people need it.  Also please do not try to force impractical traffic rules. Traffic rules should be for the benefit of all, not for fining people more.  Thank you!\n", "79- Well as you have mentioned regarding building hubs for heavy vehicles outside the city is a good plan.I would like to mention about the problems caused to the ambulances as well.Well its hard to construct a separate lane for ambulance, especially within the city.So how about painting one side of the road with one color which should be cleared by the people for an ambulance when it comes with a loud siren.which avoids confusion among people i.e, which side of the road to is to be left for the ambulance.Well i ain't know that how cool is this suggestion but at least a cop present there(at the signal) should clear the road in well advance for the ambulance in well advance and report to the next signal. Vip and politicians do get such road clearance right? Not much difference between them and an ambulance both are in hurry and also worried about their life.\n", "84- Well it's a nice plan but it's not going to stop the traffic because people never stop buying vehicles it's better government restrict more vehicles,buy increasing the road tax(well every one has a car even if there annual income is below 6lakhs).I think government has to restrict buying of cars below certain income so that it may reduce the traffic and environment pollution\n", "99- Bangalorean's perception of city traffic and use of road is like a villager's. It has not gone in to minds of people that this is a megacity and citizens have to behave responsibly. Traffic is a zoo in the city. Master Plan says increasing road density and number of buses. Previous master plans also did this. Did that help? We have ring roads smaller in width than side lanes. Ring roads on commercial complexes on either side. Mega marriage halls on ring roads with no parking basements. Basements in sanctioned plans but either no basement or that is used as shops with help of corrupt officials. BDA makes plan but BBMP sanctions plans for individual complexes, houses etc. My suggestion is start a massive campaign for educating public that this is a mega city and it is doomed if they drive and use private vehicles as they do now. Make parking expensive and put up banners for avoiding loud honks, driving without silencers, over speeding etc. On all main roads, close the medians so that erratic turning is avoided and make exit points atleast one km from each other. Make it compulsory for even high end schools to ferry children through school vans and prohibit their rich parents to ferry them in their Mercs, BMWs. \n", "119- You need to regulate the effective way of monitoring the traffic violates, have a heavy spot fine , have a massive check on sound pollution and emission check on all vehicles with a huge team including volunteer\n", "126- I have one suggestion to avoid tragic at peak times  As you know long back Delhi gov tried to implement even odd rule which is not that successful, however in Bangalore it will not work and yet we want to overcome the issue Here is my suggestion   We can try to implement 1car min 2persons at peak time, if any men coming in traffic alone in car then fine has to give and for women's you can just give warnings. from this we are trying to risk there freedom however if we try this only on trafficky areas like silk board etc   It will impact a lot and many empty cars will not come n struck in traffic, if they want to go office or home or some entertainment places they can go with there friends n family in 1 car.. And for worst case government can create one app so can the car owners can share there route in map if any riders are present they will get to ride in it for that if necessary involve money or some good credits like you did something to Bangalore u earn this something like that  One more advantage is we will get to save the petrol also \n", "127- Please make the development of roads a high priority, because it affects the economy badly and for the culture of the city. Broader roads to be built which would be future ready to randomly accommodate the increasing migration to this city.. Being a silicon valley of India...

These types of things would make life more easy\n", "132- Different bus terminals and truck terminals are ok. but the reason for traffic here in Bengaluru is the travellers are not following the traffic the traffic rules. Due to some extend the cops are not doing there proper work. Fine should be imposed heavily to make traffic rules compulsory.

Yesterday all road going out of Babusapalya were blocked due to that. Who takes ownership of traffic???\n", "195- We know that till today no Government has fast paced anything. This looks good after next 10 years or 15 years. Not immediate solution. The need of the hour is to stop particular vehicles causing congestion in heart of the city.  For example in Mumbai, Autos are not allowed in all areas. The areas where high class people reside does not require Auto to ply. You can restrict same in Bangalore.  Next big thing is Yellow Cabs. Permissions are given to any body who can start service. Latest to include is TGYR cabs other than Ola and Uber.  Traffic checking is very poor. People without license, pollution certificate are allowed to ply causing Air Pollution and rash/hapazard driving.  Please look into stream lining current problems rather than showing Master Plan.\n", "202- It's not about increasing number of buses or roads , it's all about people's mindset and attitude. For example BMTC authorities should be more disciplined in sticking to schedules , routes , returning change , commuters must not use private vehicles if it is a single person. In such cases heavy toll must be charged..\n", "215- This sounds like a good plan, please  implement \n", "222- Requesting all concerned authorities to please plan ample space for parking vehicles & separate way for ambulance.\n", "227- Although we have quite a lot money earning AC buses, Government vehicles are the ones that causes heavy traffic.

There is often only one road for one particular area. No alternate road is oresent or if its there its too far. In other cities e.g.Pune there are multiple entry and exit points going into any area, spreading traffic evenly. With only single main entry/exit point all traffic is forced to pass through one choking point. For example, Panathur villege area has only one proper entry/exit from ORR. No small roads connecting inner gallis/roads. Everyone who wants to to in Panathur is forced through a small main road.

Safety- For the safety of all road users (young and elderly) we need proper coverage of CCTVs so that any incident can be traced back to the vehicle and its perpetrators. Traffic rules: Most drivers follow traffic rule- but more recently it has become a fashion to jump signals and many people ride their bikes on the footpath especially if they are late. No one should be doing such things in civilised societies. I wonder how authorities are letting this happen without any strict fines/punishments. A number of lives can be saved in such instances. Speed limits: All of Bangalore should have speed limits- clearly indicated and strictly enforced. In and around Educational institutions, public offices, hospitals and many other crowded places should see speed reduction. Let us give people the priority. Horn usage: Heavy fines should be enforced on drivers using horns! Horns must be banned within the city limits- everyone needs to get somewhere, so using a horn to express agony in traffic is ridiculous bullying behaviour.

The sewage line and storm water drains currently  in place is unplanned, whenever the work carry out by contractor, there was no supervision by BWSSB or BBMP Engineers.

So that even the pollution decreases. And people should segregate the waste seperately\n", "62- More importance needs to be given to segregation at source with strict enforcement and deterrent measures such as big fines for non segregation at least of wet / dry waste. Of course this goes in par with frequent collection. If daily door to door collection is not possible, and since wet waste cannot be kept more than a day, maybe an option is to have wet waste collection points / composter in each street, maintained by the municipality.

Absolutely no coordination hence black spot are simply multiplying and littering of garbage everywhere has become unstoppable & uncontrollable.  Hence garbage pick up pattern should be looked into and installation of cameras is a must to monitor and penalize the dirty makers of the locality. \n", "74- There should be a plan for handling the STTP issue as well. Why every apartment complex should have its own STTP plant which is an additional expense for the residents and is always dangerous for the workers like recent deaths in one of the apartments. No other city in the world has this concept and waste is collected through the sewerage pipes and is processes in central plants. Citizens pay property tax, Water and Sewerage connection charges but end up arranging their own water and sewerage treatment plants. This is not what you expect from a state capital that aspires to be a leading smart city. The BDA and government should plan for laying the sewerage network and central processing plants.\n", "75- garbage/landfills are not enough, Reverse Wending machine is a new idea which world is going to use..  bringing awareness to people about waste management and bringing more clear solutions to help residences to dispose their garbage.  cleaning existing drainage is necessary, open drainage needs to closed.  need to have more dustbins around corner of bus stands, streets.   \n", "77- Need to recycle efficiently as we see garbage getting dumped in lakes and also level of segregation very poor.

I often notice, that the garbage carrier, mixes all together, collected from different sources (Dry and Wet waste). A thorough check should be done with them, before they dispose them. Majority of the carrier vehicles are poorly maintained, dirty and releases thick smoke.\n", "82- Happy with the process of waste management....but again it all depends on how we as individuals contribute towards the success of this process. \n", "85- Garbage is a bane of Bangalore, everything looks fine on paper but execution and accountability is nil. Collection and primary segregation to some extent is happening, but transportation is really bad. No place for consolidation nor secondary segregation. There is no concept of compaction . I feel designated areas in each ward to be allocated to carry out secondary segregation and compaction, reduce the burden of waste in volume. This is is the basic problem we face, the filth on the corners created by bbmp, the burning which goes unchecked leading to pollution and health hazards and also street dog menace. All hotels should be having biogas plants to reduce the load of food and wet waste. The abattoirs should have a plan to dispose the remains, all plastic paper, cups, plates should be banned a good idea to come back to earthenware pots and cups. Streets should be provided with bins at every corner which is easily operable and user friendly. I feel for the garbage handlers, they should be given a decent uniform and gloves for handling such waste. Finally the disposal is still a problem. By reducing the waste generated and proper segregation and compaction the volume can be brought down and this disposal should be done ward wise rather than taking it through the city spilling all over.  Awards for the best wards, recognition for the pourmikars , incentives, proper accountability and legislation would go a long way of getting rid of this problem \n", "87- 1.In every ward dry waste collection centres need to be established and they should work. 2. There shd be provision for sanitary waste to be collected separately and not mixed with wet waste. 3. Incinerators should be provided at the ward level to dispose sanitary waste.\n", "90- Enforcing waste segregation at the origination point is very important. Unless that is enforced, rest all will be very challenging to achieve. All the Large housing societies should at least be able to recycle all organic waste inhouse and use for landscaping etc. Then the plasctic waste is supposed to be segregated in recycled or non recyclable category. A lot of waste is still not classified correctly to be segregated.\n", "94- All plans on paper look good. Implementation is the key. Businesses that do not comply with waste segregation and waste management should be forced to shut shop.\n", "96- Looks unrealistic not to have any land fills.. even developed countries have some land fill but their collection, segregation and most importantly, the citizens are involved with right education and awareness. Here even if citizen segregate, the collectors mix and take. So, patchy implementation and adherence in few wards doesn't solve the problem.  As photo op, politicians/leaders do launch some scheme and then no clear implementation and accountability exist down ward and this results in poor implementation. Completely privatize the collection of garbage to some good corporate.. and it will work. Otherwise, same contractors and lorry mafia will continue even at 2031. \n", "100- Why can't we use garbage into tar road making,  as it's already done at Kamraj  road ,where garbage was melt down due to high temperature of TAR material,  pollution less and there a Is huge requirement of good roads. \n", "102- Waste collection facility should be done 24x7.  Waste collection centers should be installed in every ward. Throwing waste on road should be strictly monitored and violators should be punished severely like disconnecting power/water etc.  The segregated waste can be bought by government for minimum price and the recycled output can be used/sold by government in various schemes. \n", "103- Waste management in public areas should be organised. Recycle bins and wet and dry waste bins should be kept every 200 mts in roads and in cross roads.

This will also help city tourism development and increase business investments which will create more jobs and importantly will attract huge acknowledgment from countries all over.  Also there should be strict sessions/syllabus in every school and awareness programs in every single home and cleanliness starts from there. Proper management and installation of garbage boxes in each and every nook and corners of the city. \n", "108- It's a good vision however the education and behavioral change in people has to be brought in.  Currently I see no segregation of waste even by those who are educated about it's importance. The garbage collections vehicles should deny accepting if not segregated.  Installation of CCTv's at areas where garbage is thrown by people regularly and a stringent policy to fine and punish the offenders. \n", "109- I have a suggestion that please have waste collection cans, huge ones per street where each household /building should segregate and put their wastes.

Once this happens, a lot of the space consumed today because people cannot walk on this path etc can be cleared out and better usage of the space we have.\n", "117- The pornakarmikas to be given More safety measures and rights to refuse picking of waste if not segregated.

The current Sewage treatment plants barely manage 50% of the requirement, thus leading to pollution of the lakes and the surrounding land and ground water. Adding more strategically located sewage treatment plants with new efficient methodologies, will help reduce the discharge into our lakes, thus saving them. This also resolves our water problem as more and more lakes will become available for water supply.\n", "120- There are many places like Kodigehalli and Sahakarnagar where garbage are dumped on the road.

Stringent limiting of water use (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural) should have been put in place when the city's population crossed 5 million. In early 2018 the population is 10 million and the 3 agencies have no water rationing mechanism for the city. An allocation of about 600 litres/day per typical household (see pg 105 for the figures) is far too high for a metro that has lost three-quarters of its water bodies over the last two decades. Projecting a population of 20 million in 12 years with this water allocation per household is incomprehensible and shows just how far out of touch with hydrographic cycles the 3 agencies are.\n", "43- Rains are more than substantial in Bengaluru and bbmp should consider storing these water in underground reservoirs in the time of need. Proper drainage channels will help in this regard.\n", "49- In the plan, why BWSSB has no plans to recycle water and sell to the citizens by way of tankers/dedicated pipelines to big apartments. ?? They seem to be putting all the responsibility on the citizen even in the master plan!! Regarding Cauvery water supply, please have Tippagondahalli Reservoir functional by preventing misuse of land in and around it.

Most house owners are doing only name sake rainwater harvesting. It's not enough to drill borewells and provide taps from common taps. These borewells need to be fed.

One step would be planting plants including fruit bearing/medicinal etc. along the both banks of the river Kaveri at least one kilometre on each side. so that ground water will increase in few years and steps also should be taken to manage waste from Industries and fine them if waste is not treated and being released into natural streams. Wastewater treatment plants to be constructed by the government for this purpose. \n"], "Sewage systems will be located in close proximity to ensure recycled water reaches buildings\n": ["5- I would like to suggest that our storm water drains be made porous and incorporate recharge pits in them, so that the water outflow is reduced as a major part of the flow can get absorbed into the soil and restore the ground water . This simple system will recharge all the bore wells, open wells and also reduce the incidents of flooding.This has been implemented in many countries successfully and is is solution for the future of our cities.\n", "6- I believe the government should also consider public rainwater harvesting and recharge to offset the huge amount of land that has been paved with roads and concreted over. My suggestion is to mandatory have bottom stones in roadside drains removed or replaced by seepage gratings every 30 feet. Zain addition there can be recharge pits constructed at low points in roads etc where overflow can be run off in the normal roadside drains. Water recharge by the govt on such a scale would augment small measures by people in their own residences or apartment complexes. If we continue taking out ground water at the rate we currently are and don't do something to recharge this precious resource in a thought out and proactive way our future generations in Bangalore will be doomed.

Setting up water recycling centres at convenient nearby location is just a statement not necessarily to happen Locations should be identified now itself. Construction of duct along existing water line is must considering future expansions. Now existing water line and add recycled water line will be inside duct and should be large enough to add or replace with large did lines without digging the road. The number of inspection covers depend on length of a single pipe or flexible pipe.  Rain water harvesting should be made compulsory irrespective of the condition arra Storm water ducts on with side of road should have restricted flow barrages and several holes with tubing for water to seep in soil.

Another point is to convert all the existing lakes into sewage treatment plants with natural methods or for example as the lake Hussain Sagar in Hyderabad which is a tourist attraction but actually a sewage treatment plant.\n", "78- The Master plan should aim to supply 24x7 supply as considered for other Smart cities. The main source being Cauvery needs to be effectively and potentially utilised. Citizens should be made aware of the value of water and needs an intensive training.\n", "80- How does one get out of the Water mafia? A city dependent of private tankers for its citizens and expansion is risky and flawed. If the city cannot supply piped water supply to its citizens, BBMP / BWSSB should supply water out of the taxes we pay and not charged separately by private tankers. \n", "81- Unless you provide water to private layout residents, your master plan is useless.\n"], "use technology to make recycled water fit for drinking\n": ["4- There is no mention how govt stops water mafia and groundwater exploitation. Rainwater harvesting is not still made mandatory. Also more technology should be used to identify water pilferage across the pipelines. Water rationing is must. Beyond certain usage, the price has to be increased significantly. \n", "12- Rainwater must be absorbed as soon as it falls on the ground by remodelling rainwater drains. I can give technology for this.\n", "13- Recycling is most important, but the plan doesn't include any proposal to improve the ground water. Preservation of lakes and pond very important and should not make the lakes be the sewage facilities of bigger apartments inside Bangalore.\n", "26- Ground water level is decreasing rapidly in Bangalore, recycling water is not the only thing to be done, more innovative ideas should be thought through. Some of the factories use lot of water resources they must be forced use recycled water and also strict  regulations have to be made for these companies to have filters so that they don't pollute near by water bodies. Similar rules are required for big apartments which are getting water from borewells and tankers.\n", "29- More innovative ways to solve water woes.

Why all water payment is not through digital.. And this is plain water. Why its being charged.. I can understand transportation charge but why its so high.. When will basic necessity of water being fulfilled by municipality. Let them charge as per the consumption but through private party is black money. Let it via \"pay as you use\" mode. North Bangalore is fully ignored by BWSSB,\n", "42- 1. Make aerators compulsory for all buildings. They save a lot of water. 2. RO water purifiers are not needed in most areas. People who use them shd store the water water and use it for v Mopping , cleaning etc. 3.work with resident to tackle the problem of water leakage in pipes. 4. Do not harass residents of apt complex to retro fit STP. It's not feasible 5. Rain water harvesting should be encouraged.

Few of them are more dirty and few of them are very close to dry state (not this year, because of heavy rain). We need to do some program/guidance to increase ground water level. For this again we have to encourage people to use water harvesting in their house/society. Gov has to make tough rules for builders/individual owners to make the provision for rain water harvesting and without that don't give any kind of approval for that project. We also have to ask builder/individual owner to make provision to use the wate water in the house/society in other way. For example, in any society we can make a provision to use the water which is going out from water filter. This water can be used for flush/plantation etc. There should be a dedicated pipe line to utilize this water. We also encourage people to use some new technologies so we can save some water during our general usage like (hand wash, brushing etc...) Again it will not be possible from active participation of public but gov must start awareness program and keep doing this regularly instead of just for name shake.  \n", "76- We are blessed with Mother Kaveri and we have to utilize water wisely, and management has to take more care on the same.  nowadays water is precious thing in the world, Management has to create awareness programs. \n", "83- Not reassuring to include but then name someone else responsible.
