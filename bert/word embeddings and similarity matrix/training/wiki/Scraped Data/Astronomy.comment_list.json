My understanding is that it is all enclosed behind the appropriate links. Now if you want...we could have an explanation of positional astronomy and an explanation of radio telescopes etc. etc. but that isn't going to be very useful to the reader.

I agree that the page shouldn't go into too much depth, but I think a brief overview of all the main areas (and some of the minor areas also) is useful, with a more in depth treatment on the individual pages. I also think that in some cases, it is useful to have a brief note next to links; it probably isn't obvious to an average reader what [[precession]] is, for instance, and a note would give them the briefest possible explanation of it, so they know whether they want to read more. People who know what it means are probably going to use the search function anyway. That said, this isn't a subject I know much about, so I'll let those who know more get on with it.--[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]\n\nI don't know if a brief cliff's note describing precession would be of any use to the reader either.

The page is now merely a laundry list of links to other pages, whereas before it was actually a readable article! Imagine you know nothing about astronomy. Reading through the article, you see a bunch of links with incomprehensible names. Why should you click on any of them? Which should you click on? It's unusable.\n\nIt IS still a readable article. There are several paragraphs at the top. Imagine you know nothing about astronomy...where to start? I advise you make [[Astronomy for Beginners]]. This page did not serve the function you suggest before it was edited to this format. Such a page would probably refer the reader to [[Amateur Astronomy]] and [[positional astronomy]].\n\nThere's nothing wrong with duplicating information. Ideally, we want a short discussion of each important topic in the astronomy article, with the topic examined in greater depth in the full page. See, for example, the [[Physics]] article, which contains a short history of physics with a more detailed history in the works in a separate page. It isn't perfect, but I think it's more motivating than a laundry list.\n\nLir, could you please put the removed information back on this page? -- [[User:CYD|CYD]]\n\nThe only difference I can see between this and the physics page is that we have moved the [[history of astronomy]] to it's own page.

[[User:Lir|Lir]] 22:49 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)\n\n:No one is disputing that all of astronomy cannot fit onto one page, but it does not follow that the astronomy article should be little more than a list of topics.

To my understanding, space telescopes are used to:\n\n* avoid atmospheric opacity at certain wavelengths\n* avoid atmospheric emission at certain wavelengths\n* avoid the effects of [[Seeing disk|astronomical seeing]] in the optical band\n\nThe quoted sentence occurs in a discussion of infrared telescopes. If thermal infrared is meant, then I reckon the statement is true; see [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and [[IRAS]] for examples of instruments that do not suffer from atmospheric thermal emission (which I suppose is a form of EMI in this context) as a result of being space-borne. However there is also the near infrared, a band in which the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is active, and being spaced-based in this band has nothing to do with avoiding EMI since there are plenty of ground-based near-IR astronomical instruments.\n\nSo my question is: Is this just a matter of not distinguishing between near-infrared and thermal-infrared applications? Or is the statement meant to apply to all space telescopes working in either infrared band? In either case, I think the statement needs to be clarified.

One editor (Markus Schmaus) refuses to allow the scientific method be listed as a natural method unless a link can be provided to support the claim. I assume he is a proponent of [[Intelligent Design]] which pushes the view that ID is \"scientific\" even though it investigates supernatural causes such as how God must have creaeted life on earth. I assume it is this POV that is getting pushed, and Schmaus will not allow the scientific method be listed as an example of MN because then ID would not fit in the scientific method.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Unsupported_claims_in_lead_section]\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the dispute until some sort of consensus was reached, I removed the mention of the Scientific Method as an example of [[methodolgical naturalism]] and instead inserted \"astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics\" are examples of methodological naturalism. Schmaus is now disputing that these are examples of MN and insists on a URL to prove that they are natural methods rather than supernatural methods of scientific investigation.\n\nSince [[methodological naturalism]] is a minor article with only a few editors, the dispute has remained unresolved for lack of any sort of consensus.

Is life as most believe similar to bacteria or do we have a larger part to play?\n\nWell Perhaps each planet is also a stable chemical conglomeration. Life on earth for example could be a catalyst or agent in the balancing of whatever chemical compound this planet is.\n\nHow would you go about proving a theory such as this? Well I thought that perhaps if you look at the earths main (solids, liquids and gases)chemical components as ratio's\n\nfor example:\n\nCarbon 2:Oxygen 1: Hydrogen 1 etc... \n\nThen also look at what constitutes the moon in same way, and then look at all known chemicals for a similar pattern?\n\nWe might be living on a stable carbon monoxide element or something, you don't really know.\n\n\nHopefully you can understand all this, It makes more sense than god.\n\n-nick\n\n:Hi Nick. As neat as your thoughts are, I don't believe you're supposed to use article talk pages this way, so please limit yourself to discussion related to the article.

But the pursuit of science is rapidly and vastly broadening our knowledge of the reasons for a lot of \"occurrences\": both good and bad and it behooves us to try to steer our path of (progress?) into areas with a maximum possibility of continued existence. And I hope you'll go along with that.

The gravitational force is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance between any two gravitating objects. If you were to move the earth to a distance twice as far from the sun, the sun would only exert a gravitational force on the earth 1/(2 times 2) = 1/4 as strong; 3x as far, 1/(3 times 3) = 1/9 as strong; etc. Because the moon is closer to the earth than the sun, earth's gravity on the moon is strong enough to make it revolve predominately around the earth. The sun's gravity still tugs on the earth and moon, however; in fact the gravity due to each of the planets and the sun tugs on earth of the other planets, in varying degrees depending on the masses and distances between them. From the formula below, you can see how the [[gravitational force]] <math>F</math> depends both on the mass <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math> of the two attracting bodies and the distance <math>r</math> between them:\n\n<math>F=-\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>G</math> is known as the [[universal gravitational constant]].\n</blockquote>--","user":"Geremia"},{"date":"2008-05-19T23:13:00Z","id":136,"parent_id":0,"section":"Why the moon doesnt revolve around sun????","text":"The earth and the moon of course have interacting orbits around the sun. The subject matter is the orbital mechanics of the orbits. After the moon's perigee with respect to it's orbit around the sun the moon with mass 1 receives an increase in angular momentum (around the sun) for 13+ days from the earth with mass 81.  This results in the moon speeding up in it's orbit and rising up and over the earth's orbit to its point of apogee. Then for the next 13+ days the moon is slowed back down and the angular momentum is transfered back to the earth.WFPM","user":"WFPM"},{"date":"2008-03-27T22:46:00Z","id":137,"parent_id":0,"section":"Scientific Discussion - Astronomy","text":"http://www.intellecttoday.com/\n\nIntellectToday is a place to discuss Astronomy, as well as other scientific and philosophical subjects.\nIntellectToday has an extensive database related to Astronomy and Astrophysics, and considers it one of it's primary points of focus.  —Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by","user":"71.181.181.118"}]
