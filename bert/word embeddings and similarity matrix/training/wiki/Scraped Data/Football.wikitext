== Blokjesvoetbal/Flesjesvoetbal ==

Was there any reason for a redirect to the talk page of the Association football article?

Anyway, what I really wanted to discuss: school kids in the Netherlands play a game called ''blokjesvoetbal'' (lit. 'block football') or ''flesjesvoetbal'' (lit. 'bottle football'). It is typically played by three players or more, although more than, say, 7 players is unusual. 

The playing field needs to be fairly level: on it, bottles or bricks are placed, or anything not too big that can topple over. The objects are usually placed in a wide circle. Each player gets to guard exactly one brick. Points are scored by shooting the ball against a brick so that it falls flat on the field. The defender has to put the brick back up and the game resumes. As with [[Three sided football]], alliances can be made on the spur. 

What I wanted to ask: is this game at all known outside the Netherlands? Is it a form of 'football', or should it be listed elsewhere?

== Warwickshire? ==

I don't think it's correct to include [[Gaelic football]] or [[Australian Rules Football]] under "Warwickshire", unless there is some cource which says that Gaelic took it's inspiration from previous varieties being played in Warwickshire, which I doubt!

Although there is no proof of the link between Gaelic and Australian Rules, the similarities are strong (reflected in the cross over of players and the [[International Rules]] matches), and the original influence of Rugby on Aussie Rules has now all but disappeared. So these games should be grouped together. (Grant; March 2, 2004.)

----

I have now created a separate "family" of Irish and Australian football. Secondly, I don't know if anyone knows which game was the first "football" to have an official set of rules, but Aussie Rules was definitely codified before the FA existed, so I have mentioned it in a new paragraph in the history section. Also, the FA's first set of rules was not "Association football" ''as we now know it'' --- in fact there were a lot of similarities to modern Rugby (see the [[Rugby football]] article for more on this). I have re-worded the history to reflect this. (Grant; March 3, 2004.)

== Cambridge, Sheffield, Australian Rules & Gaelic football ==

The Cambridge rules (which formed the basis of the FA rules) were drawn up in Cambridge in 1848. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 09:59, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

----

You are right, although the original [[Cambridge rules]] have not survived and they ''seem'' to have had as much, if not more, in common with modern Rugby. (Likewise the [[Sheffield rules]] (1857) are also often said to have contribued to soccer, although to me they seem to have shared a common ancestor with Aussie Rules, i.e. the ball could be ''caught by any player'' (marked) from a clean kick and there was ''no offside rule'' at all.) Anyway, I guess the main point is that the Cambridge rules should mentioned as the forerunner of both soccer and Rugby.

I'd also be interested to hear whether rugby (football) really has anything to do with "Warwickshire football", or was really the creation of the Rugby School and other public schools. (Grant; March 7, 2004)

::Everybody played by whatever rules they liked (even in Australia) as there was no official body to declare that one rule was right and another wasn't. The FA was formed with the express purpose of providing that official body and they attempted to establish a ''single'' code. The Blackheath team were party to the formation of the FA but withdrew at the last minute because the FA outlawed hacking (kicking an oponent in the shins). Blackheath went on to form the RFU and ironically later lobbied succesfully for hacking to be banned from the Rugby code. The modern game of Rugby was created by the RFU.

I've merged the [[History of football]] article back into this one, it wasn't receiving much attention where it was and the size of the history section in this article seemed to be growing. The [[History of football]] article was really only half an article anyway; ending at the Highways act of 1835 banning the game on the public Highway and which led to the development of the game on a pitch sepcially laid out for the purpose. I had written more on later developments but got bored with the subject, I'll have to find my notes. You may notice that the history section has sometihing to say about the possible origin of Aussie Rules. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 10:52, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Good job, well done Mintguy. For clarity's sake, I've broken up some paragraphs, rearranged some, added a par about Canadian & American football, inserted some bits about rules to show how the Cambridge rules (etc) differed from Association football and made many other small changes. Hope you approve. (Grant; March 9, 2004)

A few points. Firstly the FA is not a league. The FA only organised a league with the formation of the [[FA Premiership]] in 1992. It's impossible to say that the game ""not banned" in Ireland resembled Gaelic footbal or anything else, There is no evidence. Gaelic Football itself is an invention of the GAA, You cannot say "Although Gaelic football had been played in Ireland for centuries..." There was no such thing as Gaelic Football, it was an uncoded form of football like everywhere else. The 1848 rules are lost, but there is apparently little difference between them and the ~1856 version in Shrewsbury School's libray. These rules are taken from "The History of the Football Association" (1951) They are as follows -

===Cambridge Rules of 1856===
:1. This Club shall be called the University Foot Ball Club. 

:2. At the commencement of play, the ball shall be kicked off from the middle of the ground; after every goal there shall be a kick-off in the same way or manner. 

:3. After a goal, the losing side shall kick off; the sides changing goals unless a previous arrangement be made to the contrary. 

:4. The ball is out when it has passed the line of the flag-post on either side of the ground, in which case it shall be thrown in straight. 

:5. The ball is "behind" when it has passed the goal on either side of it. 

:6. When the ball is behind, it shall be brought forward at the place where it left the ground not more than ten paces, and kicked off. 

:7.• Goal is when the ball is kicked through the flag-posts and under the string. 

:8. '''When a player catches the ball directly from the foot, he may kick it as he can without running with it. In no other case may the ball be touched with the hands, except to stop it.''' 

:9. If the ball has passed a player and has come from the direction of his own goal, he may not touch it till the other side have kicked it, unless there are more than three of the other side before him. '''No player is allowed to loiter between the ball and the adversaries' goal. '''

:10. In no case is holding a player, pushing with the hands or tripping up allowed. Any player may prevent another from getting to the ball by any means consistent with this rule. 

:11. Every match shall be decided by a majority of goals.

I've highlighted 8 as this is the reference to the 'mark' (clearly this is the only time the ball can be handled)  and also the part about loitering in 9 because this is effectivley an offside rule. Thus these rules clearly favour  the kicking game[[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 13:56, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Here are the 
===Sheffield Rules of 1857===
:1. The kick from the middle must be a place kick. 

:2. Kick Out must not be more than 25 yards out of goal. 

:3. Fair Catch is a catch from any player provided the ball has not touched the ground or has not been thrown from touch and is entitled to a free-kick. 

:4. Charging is fair in case of a place kick (with the exception of a kick off as soon as a player offers to kick) but he may always draw back unless he has actually touched the ball with his foot. 

:5. Pushing with the hands is allowed but no hacking or tripping up is fair under any circumstances whatever. 

:6. No player may be held or pulled over. 

:7. It is not lawful to take the ball off the ground (except in touch) for any purpose whatever. 

:8. The ball may be pushed or hit with the hand, but holding the ball except in the case of a free kick is altogether disallowed. 

:9. A goal must be kicked but not from touch nor by a free kick from a catch. 

:10. A ball in touch is dead, consequently the side that touches it down must bring it to the edge of the touch and throw it straight out from touch. 

:11. Each player must provide himself with a red and dark blue flannel cap, one colour to be worn by each side

===Origins of Australian Rules===
Now I'm confused. In looking for these original Aussie rules. I get that - Thomas Wills, William Hammersley, James Thompson, and Thomas Smith came together  on May 17, 1859, to draw up a set of rules. What have thse two guys you mention got to do with it? And I still can't find a copy of these original Aussie rules. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 14:14, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Oh can can you please create an accoutn and log in. It would make life easier. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 14:16, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Ok I've found a site with the first Aussie Rules of May 1859. http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/melbourne.htm. Interestingly the site ays ".. 1858 witnessed both the famous 'grand football match' between teams of forty a side from Scotch College and Melbourne's Church of England Grammar School, traditionally regarded as the fledgling code's first manifestation ... the establishment of the Melbourne Football Club was a definite event which can be precisely located chronologically, the earmarking of 1858 as the year in which Australian football was 'born' is a mere convenience, with nothing substantive to back it up.  Football of various sorts had been played in Melbourne for at least twenty years". Thus the first rules of May 1859 is the watershed.

===General comments on Cambridge, Sheffield & Australian rules===
I agree with some of the above comments, but would like to make a few points:

1. A "league" can be a generic word meaning an organisation, as in the Temperance League, the Anti-Nazi League or the Canadian Football League, rather than necessarily being a competition. The fact that there was no Premier League prior to 1992, does not mean that that there was no "league" in the generic sense.

:Fair enough. dictionary.com says - League - An association of teams or clubs that compete chiefly among themselves. However, to me league suggests a league competition as opposed to a knockout competion, and this didn't appear until the formation of [[The Football League]].

2. Re. the game "not banned" in Ireland: I take your point, but the original par speculated that it was a Norman game, which cannot be said with any certainty either.
:True. Fair to take out the Norman reference altogether. Although I'm sure that I read somewhere about a possible Norman link that led me to write it in the first place.

3. Being very familiar with both Aussie Rules and soccer, I can say out of the 10 substantive Sheffield Rules, only four are at all similar to present day soccer, whereas six are identical or partly similiar to Aussie Rules (not counting the one about caps, although they were worn by Aussie Rules in the early years :-). Of course it doesn't prove a direct link between Sheffield and Aussie Rules, but that's not what I said in the text.

:Ok, ignoring rule 11 about caps, 1,2,6,7,9,10 are all akin to rules in the Association game. Rule 8 can be interpreted as either allowing brief touches of the ball or as banning holding the ball whilst running. For sure these rules could be said to be ancestral to all subsequent games, but they definitely favour the kicking game, but they are a bit of a distraction as far as the Association game is concerned as the rules of Thring and other people at Cambridge were used by the FA.

:: Comments: 1. But it's the absence of offside which makes the Sheffield Rules so different to soccer. 2. Aussie Rules is both "handling" and "kicking". 

4. The fullpointsfooty.net site is an excellent, if still-developing source, in regard to the later history of Aussie Rules, and it's true that the game between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar ''is'' a historical red herring. However, Geoffrey Blainey's (1990) ''A Game of our Own: The Origins of Australian Football'' (Information Australia, Melbourne) is regarded as fairly authoritative. I don't have a copy with me at the moment but Blainey describes a trial game played by Tom Wills and friends at the "Richmond Paddock" in Melbourne on July 31, 1858. There had to be provisional rules for that to occur. Wills (1836-72) had  been educated at Rugby and had played cricket for Cambridge, so he would have been familiar with many varieties of football played in England in the early 1850s. H.C.A. Harrison was Wills's cousin, they were close in 1858, and they were named in 1906 as official "fathers of the game", but that does appear to have been generous to Harrison. I will do some more digging on him.

:[http://www.mcg.org.au/history/news6.htm] has this to say about the Richmond Paddock game - ''"There were few rules, just men determined to have a kick. Some had experience of football from English public schools, some had no football experience at all. On the same day, Melbourne Grammar School played football against a group of men who called themselves the St Kilda club and the lack of rules caused a fight that ended the game."''. I think this match can be pretty much ignored as far as being a significant date is concerned. It's only real significance is that Wills was involved in it and he was obivously the real driving force behind the development of the Australian game. His influence as you quite rightly point out would have almost certainly been from his experiences in England. Any allusion to a connection between Aussie and Gaelic football is in my opinion a complete red-herring. Aussie rules main influence was clearly the English public school rules, through Wills and presumably others (you yourself point out the similarly between the Aussie rules and the Cambridge rules). I think you definitely have to look at May 1859 with the most significance. In a similar way I have not brought up the fact the Thring and de Winton (both ex-Shrewsbury) established a club with some old Etonians in 1846. They would presumably had some agreed rules to play by. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 22:45, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I'm aware of the MCG site -- it's sketchy at best, and overall I don't think it's as factually reliable as it should be. You may interested to know that Blainey also decries the influence of Gaelic (and Marn Grook) on Aussie Rules. ''However'' (a big however), the similarities are as plain as the nose on your face, as demonstrated by the "International Rules" compromise -- a compromise between either of these games and either rugby or soccer would be impossible.  If you represent the history as a dichotomy between "kicking" v. "handling" then the above games appear as nothing more than compromises between the two tendencies. However, what contrasts them to the other games more than anything is the total absence of an '''offside''' rule; a huge difference. And I'm not aware of anyone explicitly suggesting the opposite: i.e. that the 1884 Gaelic rules came from nowhere, or were influenced by Aussie Rules, Sheffield rules or one of their public school predecessors! Thats would be unlikely, considering the political implications. To me it is far more logical that localised Irish games influenced one or more of the English public school games. (Since the Irish peasantry would not have been as well-travelled as English schoolmasters.) Of course there is probably no way of proving this.

People like simple solutions to historical questions: "A led to B", but few questions can be answered so simply. Some can't be answered at all.

Firstly please create an account. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 10:40, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I think by "handling" we mean running whilst carrying the ball. As I understand it you can't do this in Aussie rules.

You should note that the original 1863 FA rules still included the concept of "a fair catch" and a "mark" - ''8. If a player makes a fair catch, he shall be entitled to a free kick, providing he claims it by making a mark with his heel at once; and in order to take such a kick he may go back as far as he pleases, and no player on the opposite side shall advance beyond his mark until he has kicked.''

===Offside (lack of in Australian, Sheffield and Gaelic rules) ===
I take your point about offside. I had not recognised the significant fact that both Aussie and Gaelic football lack offside rules. The drafting and interpretation of the offside law has always caused problems. The Cambridge off-side rule of 1848, required three players in front of goal. It is significant that the original FA rules of 1863 stipulated only one. ''When a player has kicked the ball, any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponents' goal line is out of play and may not touch the ball himself nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so until the ball has been played, but no player is out of play when the ball is kicked from behind the goal line.'' By 1866 the FA had reverted to the Cambridge rule of three players (it remained as such until 1925). The 1857 rules were only adhered to by Sheffield, and apparently the lack of an offside rule was only a temporary state of affairs. According to  ''The History of the Football Association'' (1951) an 1866 game between Sheffield and an FA side from London caused problems because the FA wanted to use the three players rule whilst the Sheffield side were using the one player rule. In the end they played two legs with different rules in each game. The published rules of Sheffield FC from 1870 (in the appendix of the above book) show a rule specifically labelled "offside". So it appears that the Sheffield 1857 rules (lacking offside) were soon abandoned. Thus the lack of offside in the Sheffield rules is a bit of an anomaly. The club was formed by players from Harrow and Harrow had an offside rule. By 1878 they agreed to not use their own rules anymore and stick with the FA rules. But offside was still causing problems in thr mid 1880s when England played Scotland.

For sure, now it would be difficult to imagine a compromise set of rules between the association game and rugby, despite the common ancestry, and the similarlity between Aussie rules and Gaelic football is striking. But I just cannot see that there is a real connection. There are so many similarities (right up to the specific wording of the rules) between the first Aussie rules and the early rules devised in England (even the first FA rules include taking a"mark"), that there can be little doubt that the public school rules were the major and perhaps exclusive influence. Is the similarly between Gaelic and Aussie footbal simply a case of parrallel evolution. I wonder if the English game had developed without offside would that too have evolved along the same lines as those two games. 

So the question is, why did Wills et al not have offside in their game? He was from Rugby and Cambridge and would have been exposed the offsde rule. Are you suggesting that the Irish in Australia influenced Wills, so that he didn't include offside? I might suggest that since offside is such a contentious and difficult rule to interpret he thought it better to leave it out. As for the Irish game, the "folk game" had all but disappeard by the time the GAA drew up their rules (much like the "mob" football in England). Their intention was to create a game different to the "foreign" (read English) games of rugby and association football, what better way to do this than to avoid the offside rule. You dismiss Gaelic football's connection to the early English games, but Michael Cusack (founder of the GAA) played rugby before becomming disillusioned with the protestant domination of the 'English' games.

Hmm, I have created an account and as far as I know I was logged in last time I edited, so I'm not sure what else you want me to do, or why(?)

The short answer to your questions is that I don't know, and I don't think anyone does. The offside thing could be parallel evolution, but there are too many other similarities between Gaelic and Aussie Rules. Watch one of each and you will see what I mean. Both of them allow handling/running with the ball under certain conditions (bouncing and/or kicking it to oneself). One of the main differences between the two is the absence of tackling in Gaelic (which causes problems in the International Rules games), but Gaelic did allow tackling in its early years. Cusack may have been disillusioned with rugby, but where did he get such a radically different game from, if not from traditional Irish games? That was what the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] was all about. 

There were very large numbers of Irishmen in Victoria in the 1850s, following the [[History_of_Ireland#The_nineteenth_century|Famine]] of 1847-51 and the Australian goldrushes (see [[Australia#Demographics]]) from 1851. Wills may have seen them playing their own varieties of football. But, as I said above: "To me it is far more logical that localised Irish games influenced one or more of the English public school games. (Since the Irish peasantry would not have been as well-travelled as English schoolmasters at least before 1847.) Of course there is probably no way of proving this." That is, the relationship may have occurred indirectly, by way of now-forgotten public school games, based on Irish versions of "football". I think the anomalies of the Sheffield rules support this idea to an extent. But I don't know.

I've never doubted that there were plenty of Irish in Australia at the time. But because the "traditional" game had virtually died out by Cussack's time, I sorely doubt that they were all ardent football enthusiasts, over and above their English contempories. Football on the public roadways had been suppressed in Britian by the Highways act and this would have affected Ireland too.
It seems to me bizarre to suggest the the GAA rules were in anyway a model of the "folk games" played in Ireland, any more than the public school rules were were a model of the traditional mob games in England. I suspect the English mob football and the Irish folk games were indistinguishable. Aside from this the rules of this time are so flimsy as to be open to a great deal of interpretation, the GAA rules in particular seem to have very little to say about the actual play. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 16:27, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)

There is no offside rule in [[hurling]] either. And although their rules were not officially codified until 1870, it is a very old game and this adds some weight to the idea that it was an Irish tradition to have players from both teams roaming freely on a playing field. Especially as there ''are'' offside rules in the related sports of [[ice hockey]] and [[shinty]] (which is also very old).

I don't see why it's a "bizarre idea" that individual Irish villages couldn't come up with their own local rules. And if traditional Irish football games had "virtually died out" by 1884, it's still not the same thing as actually dying out.

Also, I wouldn't like to assume that all of the English medieval games were "mob games" and/or had no rules to speak of. Just because there were no written rules, or few written rules it doesn't means that there weren't any unofficial rules, accepted practices/standards of play, something which still happens in many sports today.

Anyway, I'll go to the library in the next few days and have a look at some histories of Aussies Rules and Gaelic to see if there is more light to be shed on this.
[[User:Grant65|Grant65]] 14:50, 11 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Generally the only rule in mob football was that you had to get the ball to some marker by any means possible. The number of players were unlimited. This is certainly how the games that remain and are still played on Shrove Tuesday are played. Engravings from the period certainly suggest that this was the case. You have to remember that we are talking about the early 19th century. Generally working class people had to work six days a week often for 12 hours a day and had neither the time nor the inclination to involve themselves in sport as we know it. This is why the mob games of England were generally played on special days like Shrove Tuesday. It wasn't until the Factories Act of 1850 the people were given a half-day holiday on saturday afternoons. This is why football games in Britain, generally start at 3pm on a saturday afternoon. The only place where people had the  leisure time or inclination to "create" and play modern type games with strict rules were in the priviledged schools. The English public schools were the breeding grounds for these games. If some form of game with strict rules developed amongst the peasantry in Ireland it would be unique in the world.

== Amateurism ==

Grant, I like you recent edits BTW, these are things I meant to get around to, but like everything else I didn't. As you've added about Rugby League's formation coming as a result of the pressure of professionalism, and the RFU rejecting professionalism, it might be worth mentioning how the FA embraced professionalism (at first relucatantly) making the game what it is today, but I'm not sure where best to put this. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 13:20, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::Glad you approve. Professionalism is obviously more relevant to the split in rugby, but if you can see a way to include it (economically) in relation to soccer, I think that would be fine. Possibly the best place would be at the end of the section on the FA(?) [[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 16:39, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)
::Well I would have added it at that point but it breaks the chronology of the whole article. This is significant! The Amatuer Football Federation objected to the increasing professionalism of the game and broke away from the FA in 1907 (taking with them many of the public school teams) and became the Amateur Football Association (AFA). The AFA were refused admittance to FIFA in 1908 and the organization limped along until just before the First World War. The increasing professionalism had the effect of making many of the public schools reject the Association game as a game for the working classes, and hence adopted the strictly amateur Rugby Union code. Meanwhile the professionalism in the Association game meant that the standard of play became much higher, the game attracted a larger following with 'star players'. Basically the game exploded.

== Development of association football in Australia ==

BTW just found this in the History of the FA book.
:''The first reference to be found to an oversea organization in the Minutes of The Football Association is on November 5th 1883, when C.W. Alcock read a letter to a Special Committee Meeting held at 28, Paternoster Row. It came from the '''Anglow-Australia Football Club of Melbourne''', and in reply Alcock was instructed to convey to this body the "gratification of the FA Committee at the development of the Association game in the Colonies."  ... The Anglo-Australian Association was admitted to Membership of The FA in 1884. ''

:''1887: Mr Crawley of the Anglo-Australian Association of Melbourne attended a Council Meeting at 51 Holborn Viaduct, and asked the patronage of The FA for a match to be played at the Oval in aid of the funds of his Association. The Council resolved that they could not see their way to assist. ''

:''1900: Letters received from The Football Association of Western Australia and the New Zealand FA asking The FA to send out teams to play exhibition matches with the view to popularizing the game.''

:''1901 (February) Upon the report od the International Selection Committeee, The FA Council decided not to entertain the Australian and New Zealand proposal; also that a suggestion should be made to them that they should take steps to perfect their organization.''

::... there's more, but less interesting stuff about the Aussie and New Zealand assocations trying to get tours aranged, but it appears that the FA thought they were a bit Mickey Mouse. But then in 1924 we have this.

''1924: Challenge Cup presented by The FA to The Australian Football Association. The Following letter was received by the FA:''

==Link to Association football and American football articles==
This article is a little bit bogus in that it's a good academic treatment of all these kinds of football, but to most people today, "football" means one of two things, American football (in the US) or Soccer (elsewhere).  Those games have good articles of their own and that terminology should be briefly explained and those articles should be linked in the very first paragraph of the "football" article.

:If you think that needs adding then add it. However, your statement most people today, "football" means one of two things, American football (in the US) or Soccer (elsewhere), is just wrong or pehaps "a little bit bogus" - because it ignores Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.

: Nope. That would provide a good deal less information that this current format does.

==American football and Rugby League==

I think though we do need a mention of later developments in American football, such as the introduction of the forward pass (c.1905?).

There should also be a separate par (at least) on [[Rugby League]], which is a significant code (played professionally in at least three countries) and has become a quite different game to [[Rugby Union]] (In fact RL has borrowed from the US game.)  But I lack the in-depth knowledge to do this right now. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 04:05, Mar 23, 2004 (UTC)

==Relationship of Gaelic and Australian Rules==

I discovered that [[Thomas Croke]], one of the founders of the [[GAA]], was Archbishop of [[Auckland]] in the early 1870s, a time when Aussie Rules (or "Victorian Rules" as it then was) was at least as popular in New Zealand as rugby or soccer.[http://www.iafc.com.au/history/nz.html] This adds a little weight to the idea that Aussie Rules had a significant influence on the development of [[Gaelic football]].

Ah, I see it's been done automatically.[[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 04:38, Mar 27, 2004 (UTC)

: I have found an article called "The Shaping of Victorian Rules Football", by B.W. O'Dwyer in ''Victorian Historical Journal'', v60, no1, March 1989. O'Dwyer says that Australian Rules has ''always'' been differentiated from rugby by the absence of any offside rule, the need to bounce/toe the ball while running, punching the ball rather than throwing it, and a few other things. "These are all elements of Irish football. There were several variations of Irish football in existence, normally without the benefit of rulebooks, but the central tradition in Ireland was in the direction of the relatively new game [i.e. rugby]...adapted and shaped within the perimeters of the ancient Irish game of hurling. This involved punching the ball rather than throwing it, bouncing and toeing it in the process of running ... [and] having no limitation on ball movement or team placement in the absence of any offside rule. They later became embedded in Gaelic football. Their presence in Victorian football may be accounted for in terms of a formative influence being exerted by men familiar with and no doubt playing the Irish game. It is not that they were introduced into the game from that motive [emulating Irish games]; it was rather a case of particular needs being met..." I haven't as yet been able to track down a good book on the history of Irish/Gaelic football to verify this. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 06:37, Jul 11, 2004 (UTC)

==Greek error==
There is an error in the transliteration of the Greek word "&alpha;&rho;&pi;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;" in the Ancient Games sub-heading. It's given as "episkyros", but the actual transliteration of that sequence of Greek characters is "arpaston". "episkyros" would be "&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;". I don't know whether the Greek should change or the transliteration. [[User:Deadlock|Deadlock]][[User talk: Deadlock| (Talk)]] 16:43, Jul 08, 2004 (UTC)

Hi. It's been a very long time since I wrote that part of the article and I can't remember what the orignal source was. Searching on google for "&alpha;&rho;&pi;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;" brings up a site which has a mirror of the Village pump when I asked a question about those sequence of letters. My question was ''"Anyone speak Greek? I need to know for a wiki article if '&#945;&#961;&#960;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;' would equate to 'pheninda'?"'' - The respoonse I got said. ''"I think I've found that it equates to 'episkyros', but could 'pheninda' be a Romanisation of this? "'' Looking in my [[EB11]] it talks about "&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;". So I'm sure this is correct. It also mentions that the Roman Harpastum is derived from the greek verb "&alpha;&rho;&pi;&alpha;&zeta;&omega;"  (I seize), so I think i muddled these two up. Thanks for your help. [[User:Mintguy|Mintguy]] [[User talk: Mintguy|(T)]] 17:55, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== "Most other english speaking countries" ==

I noticed that my edit was instantly reverted, so I assume that this has been a controversial issue before, and I'll bring it up here.  I found that statement slightly incongruous with the rest of the section.  It states that "In the United Kingdom, as well as most other English speaking countries, "football" refers to Association Football".  However, this is nested in a section that clearly states that Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and US (four very prominent, populous English speaking countries) all use the word to refer to something else.  Can this be resolved somewhat?  I'm sorry if I'm treading already trodden territory, but it definitely sounds a little odd when you read it in that context. Could this be changed to "many other english speaking countries", or removed entirely?  The fact about FIFA is nice, but a little out of place, as most of the other members of FIFA are not "english speaking countries".  - [[User:DropDeadGorgias|DropDeadGorgias]] [[User_talk:DropDeadGorgias|(talk)]] 17:52, Jul 20, 2004 (UTC)

I think that as Americans, New Zealanders and Australians read this page, the title ''The Football Association'' should include ''(soccer)'' in the title as school children in those countries may not know that "Association Football" is the formal name for the beautiful game. As it stands there is no mention of soccer in the table of contents. [[User:Philip Baird Shearer|Philip Baird Shearer]] 12:10, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:The title of that section is called "The Football Association" because it is about the organization called "The Football Association" and not about the sport of Association football. When the FA was founded the word soccer didn't exist and there was no such distinction about there being a speciific sport called soccer. The goal of the Football Association was not to create a distinct game separate from other football games, it was to bring together the disparate rules that existed at the time. Ther other games only existed in formal terms with the creation of specific organizations decicated to following a set of rules distinct from the FA rules.

"FOOTBALL IN SYDNEY BEFORE 1914"
M. P. SHARP, Sporting Traditions Vol 4 No 1 Nov 1987
http://rl1908.com/Rugby-League-News/Sydney.htm 

quote: "The SRFU's decision not to play intercolonial matches with Victoria prompted the supporters of the Australian game in Sydney to action. A meeting of the game's supporters at Woollahra in June 1880 was well-attended and, according to the Sydney Mail's football writer, 'Leather-stocking', a clear indication of the dis-satisfaction with rugby among Sydney footballers: It is pretty well understood... that there are scores of footballers ... who play the Rugby game under protest as it were, and who would gladly welcome a radical change in the present method of playing football. A week later over 100 footballers formed the New South Wales Football Association (NSWFA), to play under the VFA's [Australian] rules. The president of the new body was Philip Sheridan, the Irish born manager of the Association Cricket Ground. 

The following month another group of footballers met to form an association to play under English Association rules, and, although soccer would not threaten either rugby or the Australian game (although it did in Newcastle [New South Wales]), the meeting is of interest here in that it reflects the antipathy of rugby supporters toward the Australian game. Senior rugby officials warmly welcomed the introduction of soccer which they believed would improve the skills of rugby players. Indeed, there was only one dissenter at the meeting, a committeeman with the NSWFA, F. Lyons. In a speech he declared that: as the colonies in many matters, political and social, had struck out a path for themselves, he did not see why the same line of conduct should not be adopted in the game of football. While averring that he had as much respect for British institutions as anyone else, Weiss claimed that people in New South Wales were 'quite as capable of judging the merits of the game as they were in England'."

[A great demonstration of the struggles over, and flux of, the word football, that in Sydney in 1880, it could mean three different games!]

==Rutgers Vs. Princeton, 1869==

(Copied from [[User_talk:Grant65]])

I'm having a slight difference of opinion with ExplorerCDT about whether the Rutgers/Princeton game was American football, rugby, or soccer. He says it was nothing like soccer. I disagree, I say it's more like soccer than today's American football, but there also may have been elements of rugby in there. So I put down "football (or soccer) " in place of "football", and we got into a dispute about it (even though I'm a Rutgersman myself). Rickyrab 06:50, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Perhaps you should do some research, like I did long ago.  Being a Rutgers student, you should know well enough where to find things in Alexander.  Do you see any mentions of "soccer" as the inspiration for "football" on the Rutgers timeline (check the link on the RU article)?  NO.  Why?  Because "soccer" had nothing to do with the founding of the game.  If you read newspapers, histories of the event, all of them point to Rugby, and that the rules were altered from English Rugby rules.  You will also see in those sources accounts of the game that to any simpleminded reader would say "Hey, this isn't soccer."

To Rickyrab (and for the edification of Grant65)...The Princeton/Rutgers rivalry in football died in 1980. They haven't met on the gridiron since. So you are DEAD WRONG in saying it "continues" in your edit on the Football article. ExplorerCDT 07:30, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:ExplorerCDT, I think I'm unbiased because I knew nothing about this particular match in 1869 until several months ago. Then I did a lot of research, on the web and in books, before writing the section on US/Canadian football. Nothing I've seen suggests they were playing a game like American football ''as we know it'', or rugby either. For example, the feature which identifies rugby and US football as "cousins" is the players being allowed to hold the ball and run with, it as far as they like. Nothing I've seen says they were allowed to do that in that college game of 1869. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 08:59, Oct 16, 2004 (UTC)

== New Names of Sports ==

Has anyone (not at Wikipedia, but somewhere on earth) come up with a system of names to use to refer to sports to avoid regional differences?? For example:

*NFL for football in the United States
*CFL for football in Canada
*AFL for football in Australia
*SL for soccer in these countries and football in the United Kingdom

== Rugger and Soccer ==

I think a historical note on the origins of the words "rugger" and "soccer" would be useful in this article. Despite the contribution of the British punk band, Wat Tyler, soccer is a word that is used in Britain. At the moment the article reads as if soccer is an American English word, which it is not. When I was at school, one was invited to play a game of RUGger or SOCCer. This was probably because the emphasis is on the first syllable and so the second syllable could be mumbled -- something which teenagers tend to do, and this is harder to do with rugBEE and FootBall (hence another slang terms like "footer" and "footy" ).

Perhapse [[Charles Wreford-Brown]] deserves a mentioned even if only along the lines of [[William Webb Ellis]]. How accurate are these descriptions and how well known is the history of the word soccer?

http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/soccercoaching/l/bl_sochist.htm
:Football or Soccer? - In the 1880's, Oxford University students used slang which involved adding an "er" to the end of words they had deliberately shortened. "Rugger," was slang for Rugby Football. A student, named Charles Wreford Brown, was asked if he liked to play rugger. 'No soccer!' Was his witty reply He had shortened asSOCiation (football) and added "er." The term was coined!

http://www.rsssf.com/rssbest/whysoccer.html
:Near the end of 1863, Charles Wreford-Brown, who later became a notable official of the Football Association, was asked by some friends at Oxford whether he cared to join them for a game of "rugger" (rugby). He is said to have refused, preferring instead to go for a game of "soccer"  - a play on the word "association". The name caught on. English public schoolboys love to nickname things, then as much as now.  The tendency is to add "er" to the end of many words.  Rugby [Union] Football became "rugby", and then "rugger".  Association Football was better know as "assoccer" and naturally evolved into "soccer" which is much easier for a schoolboy to say... Therefore, the word "soccer" has been used in the mother country of all football-type games since at least the mid-19th century.  The word "football", however, was more descriptive of the game (i.e. kicking a ball with the feet!) and was the term more frequently used.

== Name change ==
Considering that by and large, the world use of the term "football" isnt anywhere as disambiguous as this article presents, given that this article goes heavily into lesser used variants...
Proposed:
 move  [[Football]]  >>  [[Football history]]
 move  [[Football (Soccer)]]  >>  Football
The real reason is simple categorization. [[:Category:Football]] is too much of a mess to be useful at this point, and most of the world does not use the term Soccer at all.
 
-[[User:Stevertigo|==S]][[User_talk:Stevertigo|V]] 18:16, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I do not and will not support any such move. The point is not use of the word "soccer" but use of the word "football". For millions of English-speaking internet users, "football" does not mean association football/soccer. (See [[Football#The_use_of_the_term_"football"_in_English-speaking_countries]].) Attempts by soccer-philes to hijack the word are bitterly resented in those countries. The fact is there are several games with a historical right to the word. And another fact is that all of the modern games now called football have common origins. Hence this page. Secondly, much of the content actually did used to be on a page called "history of football" or something like that, which suffered from the same ambiguity. I don't see anything wrong with the category, except the misconception that it should only deal with soccer. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 01:57, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)

== Disambiguation note ==

The disambiguation note at the top of the article (whatever it is named) is there to help the casual reader who may be looking for another page. We cannot assume that reader is familiar with sports jargon or other specialized terminology. "Football codes" is not clear to the casual reader. I have attempted a couple of different ways to word that which I think would be more clear, but it is always reverted. There must be other wordings which, which while equally correct, avoid that jargon. Can other editors help suggest alternate phrasing? [[User:Jonathunder|Jonathunder]] 22:56, 2005 Apr 4 (UTC) 

:When we wish to speak of different sorts of duck we refer to different species. When we wish to speak of different methods of recording video information we refer to different formats and when we wish to speak of differently formulated sets of rules for playing the game of football we refer to different codes. The call for the word code to be replaced appears to be coming from a user from the insular looking United States, where one code of football greatly overwhelms all others. In other parts of the world where rival codes are more prominent the word is probably used more often, but it is not unknown in the USA and indeed our own Wikipedia article on Amercan football (which I have not edited) refers to "the rugby code". Code is simply the correct word to use. [[User:Jooler|Jooler]] 00:49, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:"Codes" is technically correct and I think the reference in the first sentence to "sports around the world known as "Football" " is probably sufficient to clarify this.[[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 00:52, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)

::"Codes" may be technically correct, but it's jargon. It's probably fine for the body of the article where there is room to explain what is meant. But for the disambiguation note, we are helping casual readers know whether they are at the right article, without having to read several sentences or look for a definition. Obviously United States readers are not the only users of this page, but they are a significant number. 
::I've looked through pretty much the whole history of this article. For most of its history, the disambiguation text called them "types of football" or "kinds of football" games. Those terms are quite understandable. [[User:Jonathunder|Jonathunder]] 01:22, 2005 Apr 5 (UTC)
:"United States readers are not the only users..." as are other nationalities, but we have to wade through references to "[[sidewalk]]s, [[gas station]]s [[movie theater]]s, [[rutabaga]], [[zucchini]]s, [[cilantro]] etc.. and figure out what is meant all on our own. As Grant has stated the context in which the word is used in that sentence is quite clear. "Code" is the correct word and it is no more "jargon" than "species" and "format" or "language" or a host of other words used to differentiate specific types of things from one another. Would you have us dumb down our articles and replace all those words with "type" or whatever? If this is what you are looking for then may I suggest you look at [[simple:]].  [[User:Jooler|Jooler]] 01:53, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:If "code" is the only "correct" word any you'll permit no other, why were "type" and "kind" acceptable for most of the article's history?  I'm trying to find something for the opening that IS clear to unfamiliar reader. And I'd have no problem with equally clear words in the opening of the other articles you mentioned. In fact, the opening sentences should be accessable. [[User:Jonathunder|Jonathunder]] 02:01, 2005 Apr 5 (UTC)
:While I agree that "code" is certainly not jargon, it is also simply not the correct word to use, since most people who play football and speak English would not refer to many of the variations listed as different "codes," some of them don't even have standardised rules. Changing it to say, "varieties of football" would not be "dumbing down," it would simply be in better faith. --[[User:Headisdead|Headisdead]] 14:08, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Nuclear Football ==

Hi, I noticed the revert by [[User:Daveb|Daveb]] to my addition of the [[Nuclear Football]] disambiguation [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Football&diff=13465288&oldid=13465250], with the explanation "Last disambig edit not appropriate here (is itself a specific long-form term)."  However, I don't agree with this explanation because the "nuclear" football is actually more commonly referred to as just "the Football" without any qualification.  The "nuclear" qualifier was added ex post facto in order to differentiate it from the normal sense of the word.  I thought it would be useful to have the disambiguation at the top because people may run into this usage of the word but not know what it referred to.  Specifically looking for the term "Nuclear Football" is not readily apparent for someone who is not familiar with this usage.  What do people think?  --[[User:Umofomia|Umofomia]] 07:30, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Umofomia,
:When users look up ''football'', one can safely assume they are looking for information on a some form of football game. It is extremely unlikely that someone from Wikipedia's ''international'' audience would look up the specific entity "nuclear football" (the colloquial term for a briefcase carried by an aide of president of one country) using the generic term "football". I put it to you that a person looking for information on the "nuclear football" that they would search it using that term. If we were to place a link to every colloquial term containing the word "football" we would have more disambig than introduction!
:Cheers, --[[User:Daveb|Daveb]] 12:20, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:Agree with DaveB. [[User:Jooler|Jooler]] 14:07, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:Absolutely disagree. It is the norm on Wikipedia to contain disambiguation notes at the top of articles for cases just like this.  Another option, however, would be to have [[Football (disambiguation)]] contain the link to [[Nuclear football]] as well as this article.  Then we could link to [[Football (disambiguation)]] at the top of this article.
:Note: the [[Football (disambiguation)]] article was shouted down at [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Football (disambiguation)|VfD]] about a month ago, but that was by VfD regulars and not the people who edit this page. I would have no problem with resurrecting it. [[User:TacoDeposit|Taco Deposit]] | [[User_talk:TacoDeposit|Talk-o to Taco]] 14:33, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

::But this is not a disambig for another meaning of the simple word "football", as "nuclear football" is its own complete term. Just because a term contains the word "football" as part of it does not qualify it as being an alternative use of that single word. There are probably dozens of colloquial terms containing "football", and I don't see the point in listing every single one as a disambig. --[[User:Daveb|Daveb]] 14:51, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:::See [[Brown]], for example, which has a note at the top linking to [[Brown (disambiguation)]], which contains links to all sorts of things with the word "brown" in their names.

:::See also the example specifically given by the [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation]] page, which I think pertains exactly to this situation:
::::''For example, the [[poker]] article covers the card game; it's likely that most people visiting that article are interested in the game rather than in [[fireplace pokers]]. For this reason, we link to [[fireplace poker]] from the existing poker article instead of moving that article to "Poker (game)". In many cases, there doesn't even yet exist an article on the less popular subject.''
:::...which is why I would like to see my original disambiguation note restored.  The alternative is to restore the [[Football (disambiguation)]] page, though I don't think this alternative is as desirable since it would have few entries (essentially just [[Football]] and [[Nuclear Football]]).  The Wikipedia:Disambiguation page notes:
::::''if one meaning is clearly predominant, it remains at "Mercury", the general title. The top of the article provides a link to the other meanings, or if there are a large number, to a page named "Mercury (disambiguation)".''
:::The original reason why I made the disambiguation edit in the first place was because I didn't even know the term "Nuclear Football" and only heard it being called "the Football."  Only after using Google to find out that it was also called the Nuclear Football was I able to find the Wikipedia entry about it.  This is why I added the disambiguation notice so that other users wouldn't have to go through the trouble of finding it otherwise.  --[[User:Umofomia|Umofomia]] 18:30, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

::::In the absence of any further response, I have restored the [[Nuclear Football]] notice.

== Didn't the Greeks invent football ==

On the run up of the euro 2004, the BBC Radio 1 claimed that the origins of football was in Greece, since there was a statue found. This statue is replicated on most medals... it resembles the position a footballer has moments before shooting the ball.
:Everyone "claims" to have invented football, but kicking a ball is so natural that to claim its invention (before rules were codified) is like claim to have invented running. The article mentions possible Greek origin. [[User:Jooler|Jooler]]

== '''Different Cultures, Different Style of Football''' ==

AS you may know, different countries play different style of football. For example, in ''Brazil'', the emphasis is put on the attack, whereas in ''Italy'', the defence is key to success. You may wonder why? Well, I do not think anybody knows the true reason why. I will talk more about the different cultures different styles. In '''South America''', there is a variation of emphasis of the two main football nations; Brazil is attack, ''Argentina'' is defence. However, ''Argentina'' still puts a massive amount of emphasis on attack. Other countries like ''Peru'', ''Uruguay'' and ''Colombia'' also like to concentrate on the attack, even though there ability may not be as good as ''Brazil'' and ''Argentina''. Another trait of South American football is the word 'showboating'. This is when players show off with what that can do with the ball, even though it may not be effective, however the fans love to see this. However in countries such as ''England'', ''Italy'' and the countries of Scandanavia, showboating is not that favoured. These '''European''' countries prefer to see effectivness, i.e. a goal, even if it is not a good goal to look at. In western '''Europe''', i.e. ''Portugal'' and ''Spain'', the style is very similiar to that of '''South America'''. These western European countries also love to see the showboating, it is an integral part of their football culture. It is quite strange how the two languages of these countries (Portuguese and Spanish), are also spoken in '''South America''', whereas English, Italian and Scandanavian are not primarily spoken in '''South America'''. Which brings me back to the earlier question....Why do different cultures play with different styles? It is possibly the hardest question you could get asked about in football.

===There are two main possibilities which I will talk about:===
1. Idols - it is possible that older generation players, played a certain way, and all the young kids on the streets of their country tried to copy them. For example, there could have been a player for ''Brazil'' who did lots of tricks. The kids on the streets would see this, and everybody would copy, so it is a like a constant circle.
2. Weather - the countries who play with the showboating style, i.e. ''Brazil'', ''Portugal'', ''Spain'' etc. all have good weather, so subsequently they will play football on the pitch. As you know, it is not always possible to have a football match on the beach, as it is too crowded. So people tend to stand in a circle, kick the ball to each other but keep the ball off the ground. This generates technical ability which allows players to showboat. 

===It does make you wonder.....=== Personally, I feel the best way is to 'showboat'. It shows you are having fun, and not just going out to win, which is what people are doing more and more nowadays, which is almost taking away the pleasure of playing football. I will leave you with that question again; why do different cultures play different styles of football? I would love to know the true answer.

== Ireland ==

"In the Republic of Ireland, "football" is somewhat ambiguous. Whilst it often refers to Gaelic football, the word "football" is also used when referring to Association football, particularly at the international level (as in the Football Association of Ireland the official national body) and also with a large number of Association football clubs using the initials "FC" (Football Club) in their name. The word "soccer" is often used to avoid confusion. "

There are a few issues here i'd like to discuss.  Firstly, the official name of this country is 'Ireland'.  The country 'Ireland' consists of 75% of the Island of Ireland.  The north eastern quarter is 'northern ireland'.  However, there is no need to differentiate the country and the island in this context because gaelic football is played in all counties of the Island of Ireland.  There is no such place as 'Republic of Ireland'.  That's just a term the brits use.  

Secondly, the divided use of the word 'football' in Ireland is much the same as the divided use of the word in Australia.  Whereas in certain areas of Australia rugby league is football and in other areas Australian Rules is football, in Dublin, the word football is ALWAYS taken to mean soccer.  In rural areas (particularly western counties), the same word is used to denote gaelic football.  In dublin, i've only ever heard people use the term GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) to refer to gaelic football.  GAA is the governing body for both Gaelic Football and Hurling... so it is ambiguous.  If specifics are required, the term "GAA football" is used.  Also, i've only ever heard the term 'Gaelic Football' used outside of ireland.

I'm not sure how the cities of Galway, Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny and Belfast use the word football though.  Perhaps someone else can help?

:"There is no such place as 'Republic of Ireland'. That's just a term the brits use." Sigh.  Please see [[Names_of_the_Irish_state]] and [[Republic_of_Ireland_Act]]. [[User:Jooler|Jooler]] 22:58, 29 May 2005 (UTC)
::I know there are sensitivies about such issues. I don't know what Wikipedia policy is on this but, as the [[Ireland]] article is about the whole island rather than a particular political entity, and since both codes are popular in both of the actual states within the island, I guess "Ireland" can be used without confusion :-) [[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 10:11, May 30, 2005 (UTC)

Grant.  Did you read the article on [[Names_of_the_Irish_State]]?  Can I direct you to this part... "state's official title under the Irish constitution is simply Ireland".  'Republic of Ireland' is a legal term.  Necessary to disambig when referring to the nation in legal documents.
:I'm not sure what you're getting at. We don't always respect official titles, when we need to avoid ambiguity. That's why we have articles named (e.g.) [[Roman Senate]] or [[Football (soccer)]] even though the proper names have no qualifiers (i.e. "The Senate" and "Football"). But I don't think there's any problem in using the word "Ireland" in this case. The [[Ireland]] article is an article on the whole island and both soccer and Gaelic football are popular in parts of both states within the island. Therefore the word "Ireland" will do ''in this case''. Even if we were saying (e.g.) "Gaelic football is more popular in [[Ireland]] than in [[Northern Ireland]]", I think it would be clear what was meant.

You my friend are wrong for saying this, The Republic of Ireland is a title that a war with England was fought for and then a Civil war was bitterly fought exactly over the difference between the Republic status and Dominion status. Many Irish people lost their lives during the years of these wars, these lives were lost so that they could help Ireland acheive independance from Britain and the right to be called a Republic, Do not throw it away with daft comments like that. Ireland is a Republic, its official name is the Republic of Ireland, Yes quite often now the name 'Ireland' is used as the name for the country, but this does confuse people in other countries and has led to a massive increase of the term 'Southern Ireland' which is a horrible name, the word Republic should be used with pride, this is what makes us, this is what made Ireland, It is the only difference between having a president or  the english queen as head of state.

== In the UK and Most Other English Speaking Countries??? ==

"In the United Kingdom, and in most other English-speaking countries, "football" usually refers to Association football."

After listing Canada, USA, New Zealand and Australia, and explaining that none of these countries refer to soccer as football, the above statement seems to be blatantly incorrect.  Where are all these 'other' english speaking countries?

:Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Cameroon, Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malaysia, Malawi, Maldives, Mauritius, Namibia, Nauru, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, Zimbabwe. -- [[User:Arwel Parry|Arwel ]] 12:06, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Oh and this... 

"Of the 48 national [[FIFA]] affiliates in which [[English Language|English]] is an official or primary language"

Is a cop out.  

Firstly, they can get away with referring to all EU countries, for instance, as english speaking countries because the EU official language is English.  That doesn't make them english speaking countries.

And Finally, there are 3 types of lies.  White lies, big lies and statistics!  The above statistic is a carefully designed to make it look as though most of the english speaking world don't use the word soccer.  How about a stat showing the sum of the populations of all english speaking countries (countries who's people speak english primarily) who use the word soccer in comparison to those that don't?

:Well, soccer is not my favourite kind of footy, but....I think the person who wrote that passage is correct. According to a quick count of the list on pp.100-102 of my battered ''Collins Concise Atlas of the World'', in 1984 there were about 50 countries in which English was an official language, a figure which did ''not'' include the EU countries you mention. Neither does it include countries like [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], where English is the ''[[de facto]]'' common language and "football" is soccer. (I wonder how many people realise that the Philippines has more English speakers than the UK does?) So it can safely be said that "football is soccer" in all but a handful of English speaking countries and also for the vast majority of English speakers.

::NOBODY claims all the EU countries as English speaking - all national languages of EU states, except Irish, are official languages; English, French and German are most commonly used for official business of the EU. English-speaking '''FIFA affiliates''' within the EU (completely different things) are England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Malta, and Cyprus. In most other EU countries the sport is referred to as e.g. "Voetbal", "Fussball", "Boldspil", "Fotbal", "Football" etc. Apart from "Calcio",you may notice that all are literal translations of "football" or "ball game", but in any case, they are in the local language, not English. -- [[User:Arwel Parry|Arwel ]] 12:06, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC) 

Secondly the same paragraph seems to ignore the fact that Australian people use the term 'soccer' and so do Irish people.

:: As an Irish person, I can tell you that most Irish people refer to the sport by its proper name: Football.  The term 'soccer' is a shortening originating from 'AsSOCiation '''Football''''  Therefore, no matter what other names it has, Football is the correct and original name, and 'Soccer' refers to Football.

:::Yep.  I live in Dublin and can concur that some Irish people obsess over that game as much as the english do.  However, take a drive to the west side of the country and that all changes.  That's where football is GAA football and if you want to talk about soccer it has to be qualified with the word 'soccer' or some other form of explanation.  Dublin isn't Ireland.

No.  Because i'm Australian and therefore don't follow the sport or call it football.

:In the interests of clarity, and because I hate to see existing posts broken up, I've just returned my last post and the preceding paragraph to the place where they they started. My opinion, for what it's worth, is that the decision to use the name "Football Federation Australia" is misguided, and probably futile as it flies in the face of at least 130 years of "football" meaning either rugby or Aussie rules. Probably less than 10% of the population mean soccer when they say "football", and while popularity of the sport may increase, I think its hard to see use of the word changing.[[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 13:57, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)

>Depends where you are in each country

Not in Australia.  The vast majority of people who attend soccer matches in Australia are immigrants or the children of immigrants.  No matter where you are in Australia, Soccer is not football.

*I could debate this with you at great length but this is not the place.  Many people in Australia call soocer - football.

I lived in Australia for 25 years of my life and have not once heard anybody refer to soccer as football unless they were explaining the fact that in England it is called football.
:I have to agree. The only people I have heard referring to soccer as "football" are first generation immigrants, and not all of them do either.

This is a debate I've heard through-out the world where more than one football code is played. To clarify the Irish POV, the word football is used contextually. If for example, I where to say "I've got football practice tonight" the people I'd be talking to would either know that gaelic training for me is on a Friday or would ask if it was soccer. Usually when comparing sports the terms gaelic, soccer or rugby are used. To contradict someone above, Gaelic football is often refered to as GAA, pronounced as in the ga in gag; there is no confucion with Hurling. Very rarely is rugby called football, though you may describe a ruby player as a good footballer. Soccer is only used to differentiate it from gaelic. The other "foreign" codes are usually given their full titles like American Football and Aussie Rules. [[User:Afn|Afn]] 10:35, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
: Most ''soccer'' people in Australia do call their game "football" now, but they are a relatively small minority, following the third or fourth most popular sport in terms of spectators. A TV audience of four million nationwide watched the [[Sydney Swans]]' AFL grand final win. In Sydney, which is not reknowned as an AFL city, one million watched. But "football" in Sydney usually means [[National Rugby League]], and their grand final tomorrow will probably get comparable figures. I have to doubt that a [[Sydney United]] game would do as well. Personally I doubt that many media outlets ''will'' ever "fall into line", as you put it &mdash; showing your soccer bias &mdash; because the usage of the word to mean other games, or a variety of games, is so dominant and has more than 140 years of history behind it. For example, [[Melbourne Football Club]] (Aussie Rules) was founded in 1858 and [[Sydney University Football Club]] (rugby union) in 1863.

::::''<p align="center">FOOT-BALL''.</p>
::::''This was, and remains, a game on Shrove Tuesday, in various parts of England.''

::::''Sir Frederick Morton Eden in the "Statistical account of Scotland," says that at the parish of Scone, county of Perth, every year on Shrove Tuesday the bachelors and married men drew themselves up at the cross of Scone, on opposite sides; a ball was then thrown up, and they played from two o'clock till sun-set. The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party, '''but no person was allowed to kick it'''. The object of the married men was to hang it, that is, to put it three times into a small hole in the moor, which was the dool or limit on the one hand: that of the bachelors was to drown it, or dip it three times in a deep place in the river, the limit on the other: the party who could effect either of these objects won the game; if neither won, the ball was cut into equal parts at sun-set.''[http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html]

::Hone's account shows that the name "football" was applied to games which specifically ''outlawed'' kicking, long before the modern codes existed.

While the compliment is appreciated, it's really not neccasary.  Everyone knows that our great game originated in Victoria before spreading to the rest of the continent, so calling it 'Victorian Rules' is a bit redundant and somewhat confusing.  At first I thought you were referring to some obscure code that originated in Victorian London, rather than the Australian game.

== Victorian rules descent ==

Australian Rules very obviously comes from Victoria. The variation is a Vicotrian variation. I am not questioning that its name is Aussie Rules, just that it is a game whose rules variation originated from Victoria like the two rugby codes originated from Rugby school, and soccer originated from its annagram association football.

Rugby League started at Rugby school and not at Yorkshire. The split-away governing body than started to make rule changes that differentiated it from the IRB code, but it is inarguable to say that it did not start at Rugby school. I beieve you have the wrong conception of Rugby League. It was just a professional code of the game that over time developed its own distinct rules. Neither Rugby Union or Rugby today really resemble the nature of game when it was first codified.

I am not arguing that that it does not call itself Aussie Rules, what I am saying is that it is a distinctly Victorian version of the game. To call it an Australian variation as opposed to this would be misleading for non-Australians who do not understand the regional nature of both Rugby and Aussie Rules. Nor am I disputing that it is more popular as you mistakenly concluded and decided to leave on my discussion page. I just feel that to refer to it as a Victorian variety is better for international users who are trying to understand the differences in Australian football sports.

:Whatever. The [[Australian Football League]] calls it "Australian Football". The common name of the game is Australian rules football.  That is what it is called around the world. No one has called the game "Victorian rules" at an official level for more than 100 years and I doubt that many non-Australian readers of the article would even have heard of the "Victoria" in question.  The game has travelled the breadth and width of Australia in the last 150 years and is popular in all States and Territories, to varying degrees.

Now please do not be silly, it is hardly played in Sydney etc., to say it has travelled the breadth of Australia is an exaggeration.

Of course the supporters of a national team were going to outnumber Wests Tigers and Sydney Swans supporters on the streets, after their respective grand final wins.

:And rugby league is a British variety of football, at least in its origins. So what? It seems that that you have taken stock of rugby league's poor following outside NSW and Qld and simply assumed that the reverse is also true for Aussie rules, which it is not. The Sydney Swans, Brisbane Lions, West Coast Eagles, Adelaide, Fremantle and Port Adelaide get crowds exceeding 20,000 at every home and away games. But how many NRL teams are even based outside NSW and Qld? Answer: two, and the [[Melbourne Storm]]'s home ground has a ''capacity'' of 18,500, which is miniscule by the standards of Melbourne sporting venues.

: I've looked at a few things, but the whole argument seems stupid. I was born and lived my life in NSW. Does that mean I should stop calling myself Australian, because I have not visited and lived in most parts of Australia? Same goes for Australian Rules. It's rules where formed in Victoria and it is the codes spiritual home. But for those living under a rock, Victoria is a state of Australia. Thus, saying that Australian rules is a distinct Australian form of football is correct. Perhaps for accuracy sake it should say something like 'an distinct Australian form of football invented/codified in Victoria?' [[User:POds|POds]] 07:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

::No the idea was that the country/federation we call 'Australia' didn't exist until 1901.

[[User:Factoid Killer|Factoid Killer]] 10:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

What is being said is that is a Victorian variety of football like how there were Rugby varieties of football and soccer being the acronym for association rules. It is no more an Australian variety of football than Rugby League. Therefore I think it is misleading for non-Australians, to refer to it as an Australian variety of football because it is both historically and presently a predominately Victorian type of football as opposed to Rugby in the northern states. It has nothing to do with whether Australia was a continent or not, just emphasis that it both originated in Victoria, and is still a regional game in Australia even today. Therefore I feel to refer to it as an Australian variety of football is a little incoherent, factually incorrect, especially when there is a more apt manner to refer to it as, Victorian football.

Therefore I am unreservedly for the change of the name to a Victorian variety of football.

:*'''Agree with Grant65''':
:** "Rugby" is called "Rugby Union" in this article, despite no official name change to avoid confusion, calling something "Victorian" is bound to be confusing for most people as the main meaning is the Victorian age not place. I watched Italy playing England at "Rugby" yesterday and the pundits at half time talked about "football" and "soccer". In context they meant "Rugby Union Football" and "Association Football". I am imagine that when pundits are talking about a game of "Australian Rules Football" at half time they drop the "Australian Rules" and talk about football. In context the meaning is clear. This is an article about all codes of football so full clear names are needed to distinguish the various codes even if they are not the official names. As they are not the official names common names should be used. As most people involved in a code of football do not need to distinguish it from other "football codes" (see my Italy v. England example), it is the common name used by others which should be used in this article. "Australian (rules) football" is the more common name than "Victorian (rules) football" so lets stick with "Australian (rules) football".
:** Also the removal of  "points" in the sentence "''In all football games, the winning team is the one that has the most goals when a specified length of time has elapsed.''" makes the sentence false because games of Rugby football are decided on point not goals.

:I think it's unnecessary to seperate Victoria from Australia in such a way. Whilst "Australian rules football" was originally called "Melbourne rules" and "Victorian rules", and undoubtedly was created there, in terms of the scope of the article (a sport played throughout the entire world), it is like saying [[Pétanque]] is a [[Provence]] variety of lawn bowls. "Irish varieties" is used without issue, whilst [[Gaelic football]] was developed in a certain area (from the article, [[County Kerry]]) before it spread to the country. Why should Australian rules be any different?

This is largely about weather the game can be referred to as 'Australian'.

I did not really make my argument very coherent, so I shall put it here as succintly as possible.

I believe the heading "Australian and Irish variations" should be changed to "games descended from Melbourne club rules and Gaelic rules". This is in line with the previous entries "games descended from rugby school rules" and "games descended from fa rules". 

I feel that this is a better representation of not only the Victorian game but also a clearer outline of its support within Australia. I also feel that it is more inline with how the article was presented.

Aussie rules is the most popular spectator sport in Australia, both in terms of bums on seats and in terms of TV audiences. It is also the most popular in a majority of states and territories.

You might also like to consider the many (and increasing numbers of) great players of the game, including [[Haydn Bunton Senior]], [[Wayne Carey]], [[Jason Dunstall]], [[Michael Voss]] and [[Jason Akermanis]], who have been born and bred in NSW and Qld.

Licinius, this "southern" thing is nonsense. Australian rules has been the dominant code in the NT for generations. The support for rugby league is far more limited, in geographical terms.

Well Grant, despite your attempts to malign me, you are correct. It should be referred to as a game descended from Melbourne Rules. That is clear enough and in line with the presentation of the article. Though it is debatable that it deserves a mention as a game descended from Rugby rules or miscellaneous due to the fact that it is a relatively minor Southern Australian regional game that was pretty much a copy of rugby and Sheffield Rules, (unlike the international codes of Rugby, the American football and of cause soccer) for the present moment I feel that it should be "Games descended from Melbourne Rules ....".

Please stop trying to attribute sentiments that I do not have, Grant, you have accused me of bad faith from the beginning and it reflects on your bias.

To call it a game descended from Australian variety is as silly to call it a game descended from Oceania variety, Australasian variety or outhern hemisphere variety. It is very distinctly a Victorian game and as such it should be referred to as Melbourne Rules.

:Aussie rules is a variety of football. It is Australian, and describing it as Australian is the most informative geographical description to most readers, as well as being the description used in the common name. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to call it an Australian variety of football. 

:The next question is whether it is the best heading in the context. The context is a list of many different varieties of football, in groups of related or similar codes. The first two groups both originated as distinct codes in England, and so are distinguished by their FA or Rugby school origins. The next group contains codes that originated (and are mostly played) in Australia or Ireland, and so they are described as such. There are obvious reasons to put these codes in one group, yet they are not all clearly descended from a distinct set of rules, so it is best to describe them as Australian and Irish varieties. This is about providing a general categorisation of a group of forms of football, not giving the detailed history, which is in the text earlier in the article.[[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 12:41, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

Does "Aussie Rules" deserve its own heading in this specific section at all? This whole page is far too Victorian and needs to be completely be re-edited by someone with a clear perspective, good record and proven integrity. AFL has far more prominence that it should rightly have on a page dedicated to "football". In the interests of more coherent descriptions, I feel that this page should be rewritten to put the different codes of football in a better perspective. It is not good enough to say that the "AFL" game is a generic picture of football from the era because modern football was mostly an English creation(all codes). I see plenty of better pictures throughout the page that could be used instead of it.

In the specific line, I personally feel it is indisputable not to refer to it as "Australian" per se because it is simply not an Australian game any more than Rugby. The heading I feel should be a clear indicator of the origins of the networked games just as the others are. Also the games from the AFL are more than superfluous and if it was done with the precedents created in the AFL section, there would be far too many games under both the Rugby and soccer areas.

Also there is far too much on the origins of AFL compared to the games of higher precedence like Rugby, American football and soccer. Remember people this is not just an Australian page, it is for all people who speak English who wish to know about "football".

:"Aussie rules" doesn't have it's own section. It is in a section with Gaelic football, various compromise rules and Marn Grook. This section is (rightly) after the sections for the more prominent soccer and it's derivatives and the rugby family and before even more obscure varieties. I can see more reason for another section for the north american versions, than for removing this section. If there are articles on rugby derivatives equivalent to the very minor rec footy and so on, then these should be added to the list - the list is meant to include all the variations that have articles.

:Aussie rules simply '''is''' Australian, regardless of whether rugby also is.  In some very obvious senses (origins, geopgraphically concentrated) it is more Australian than union or league. In other senses it isn't (as they are also important parts of Australian sporting culture), but the article doesn't imply anything about Australian sporting culture, etc.

[[Image:Football.png|thumb|300px|Montage]]
:There is no picture of an AFL game in the article. The picture of the game in Melbourne is, in my opinion, no better or worse than any of the others on the page. As the differences between the codes were less obvious then (and even less obvious in the pictures!), it doesn't really matter which one is used, although as many people have said a montage of modern pics would be better. Apart from the picture, I don't see why you say Aussie rules is given prominence. The article as a whole describes the evolution of english football - soccer and rugby, with short sections on the Australia, American and Irish varieties. Of these, Aussie rules has the shortest section. The only problem I see with that aspect of the article is that two of the sections dealing with the rugby codes should be expanded. 

:Apart from these sections, the article seems to do a good job of describing the history of many forms of football in the correct perspective. If it were too Australian-focussed, a non-Australian might be best placed to comment. And at the risk of making the Victorians' inferiority complex even worse, I'll point out that Victoria doesn't have a monopoly on Aussie rules anyway.

:Man from Oz, so the many contributors to the page so far do not have a "clear perspective, good record or proven integrity"? Personal attacks are not within the rules or the spirit of Wikipedia.

:The article is about the development of football codes in general. Australian rules has an important place in that history, as the second oldest surviving code after rugby union. Next you'll be telling us that Gaelic football and Canadian football get too much space...in fact you would really have to, since neither of them has the number of followers that Aussie rules does. But I wouldn't agree with you.

:And I'm sorry, but Australian rules is an Australian game in a way that neither code of rugby will ever be, because it was invented in Australia. It is also the most popular spectator sport in Australia and is the most popular sport in the most States and Territories. Please note that I said sport and not just code of football.

:According to the logic employed by you and Lucinius, Ned Kelly was a Victorian, and not an Australian. It is just crap to say that Australia did not exist in 1858 or that Tom Wills set out to create a Melbourne/Victorian game. You seem to think that Qld and NSW (minus those "AFL"-playing infidels in the Riverina and Broken Hill) are the only genuine parts of "Australia". I'm here to tell you that you are wrong. 

:"The games from the AFL are more than superfluous"? Well, the idea of encyclopedias is to provide full information. Feel free to add some superfluous ones derived from other major codes.

:"I see plenty of better pictures throughout the page that could be used instead of it." Such as? In my opinion we need an action picture at the top of the article and it just so happened that the Australian rules pic was the most generic one that I could find. Once again, I challenge the rest of you to find a single picture which captures "football" of all codes in action as well as that picture does. As opposed to one which is clearly of soccer, rugby or whatever and will cause further arguments. But as I have said before, my preferred option would be to have collage of different pictures, representing different codes, such as the one at the top of [[World War II]].

== Football ( Soccer ) ==

I want to chip in with my opinion on the use of the term football.

English has become an international language, and millions of people, regardless of their mother tongue, speak it for a variety of uses, such as surfing the 'net. In most languages other than english, I assume, football is that sport which is played with the feet. Usually this word is not translated, but rather, adapted phonetically to the speakers' native language; for example, in spanish: futbol. I think that the correct terminology for this sport should be football. However, in my opinion, it should always be qualified with the soccer term in parenthesis to avoid confusion.
:Interesting concept, but that's why we have disambiguation pages. The underlying link should indeed point to Football (soccer), but the title should reflect the correct word (ie: "football" in [[Manchester United]], but "soccer" in [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]). This particular page, [[Football]], discusses all types of football (including Australian Rules and American), the one that belongs to what is known as "soccer" in the US is located, as you said, in [[football (soccer)]].

The introduction of the article should state, in absolute black and white, the different forms of football. The opening phrase could be a list of all football types, including:
* [[Association football]]
* [[Australian rules football]]
* [[Gaelic football]]
* [[International rules football]]
* [[Rugby football]]

::and while I'm at it, I just can't believe that Australians would argue so hard to not refer to our only indigenous code of football as not being Australian.  It's simply unbelievable.  Why does it deserve some prominence?  Try these facts:  rules codified in 1859; Melbourne Football Club formed in the same year - older than 99.9% of all clubs the world over of '''all''' football codes.  The [[VFA]], the precursor to the [[VFL]] was formed in [[1870]] (if my memory serves me well) - do you all think these are trivial facts in the context of this article - get real!

Is this a joke? Aussie Rules, Gaelic and International are all relatively small games compared to the NFL, international rugby of both codes and most of all soccer. Should they realistically have more than a minor page dedicated to them?...

I am sorry, I am new to this program. I meant a smaller area of the page as compared to the major sports in order to better certify their relative size compared to the codes I mentioned.

Do the arguments above make sense to anyone?...

13:04, 22 February 2006 (UTC)[[User:J is me|J is me]]

Surely this montage needs futsol which is much bigger than AFL or Gaelic, a better differentiation between Rugby Union and Rugby League(the scrum is irrelevant in League and their are many differences of style between both forms of Rugby). To be honest, it is a bit much to have AFL or Gaelic in it. What is wrong with the people here? We need more Europeans and Americans to contribute to this. AFL is a joke compared to the major codes. What the hell is going on here?

13:12, 22 February 2006 (UTC)[[User:J is me|J is me]]

::Yes they do.  The problem here is that people from Victoria in Australia have major inferiority complex.  This is because their capital city, melbourne, is not the largest city in the country and lost its place as the capital.  It also doesn't have anywhere near the prominance of Sydney either nationally nor internationally.  As a result they are an extremely vocal minority when it comes to talking up their sport, their state and their capital city.  That is the only reason Aussie rules has been placed in this article with such prominance and backed up by so many people.  Yes everything you are saying makes sense.  Australian rules football is a very minor sport on the global scale and the suggestion that American football should be removed is just yet another brainchild of the comunal [[Inferiority Complex]] eminating from [[Victoria, Australia]].

The scrum isn't irrelevant in league but Rugby League and Rugby considered as separate sports are also much bigger sports than Aussie Rules.[[User:Factoid Killer|Factoid Killer]] 13:25, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

Also, you need a pretty severe bias to think Rugby and League should be grouped as 1 sport and then list Aussie Rules and International rules as separate sports.  This is the level of [[Inferiority Complex]] we're dealing with here.[[User:Factoid Killer|Factoid Killer]] 13:32, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

:Let's be a bit sensible here, and focus on the page rather than each other's motives. The article is quite reasonable, the bias (on both sides) is on the talk page. I agree that leaving out the north american codes and lumping the rugy codes together displays bias, probably in the form of ignorance, but noone has actually suggested removing American football. The main reason that there is only one picture in the montage representing the rugby codes (apart from the fact that they are hard to distinguish by means of a photograph, as opposed to video footage) is that there aren't any pictures at [[rugby league]] that could be included! It would be good for all the league fans here to put a bit more effort into improving that article.
There aren't any pictures of [[Futsal]], either, but even if there were it would be harder to justify considering it separately from soccer.
:Anyway, the idea is to improve the article. If you have better pictures for the montage - upload them, and ff you have a ''specific'' criticism of some other part of the article, bring it up and stick to discussing that issue, rather than responding to whatever silly comments someone on either "side" has said on the talk page.

Re: Factoid killer,

The scrum might not be irrelevant(arguably) but a scrum with breakaways is not Rugby League.

More and more people are seeing that the Victorian football supporters have a strange attitude to this which is not constructive to wikipedia.

"Aussie Rules" is no more an Australian variety of football than Rugby or Union and they seem to refuse to accept it. The montage, as J is me pointed out, is a farce. 

Grant seems to be unable to make any sound argument above the AFL is the most popular League in Australia as far as I can understand which is at best only mildly relevant, and now a whole host of contributors are surely just taking the piss. I second fellow shire boy, the man from oz and say that we need to employ the services of a non Australian administrator interested in all forms of football to sort this out reasonably.

==A Game of Our Own==
For those who doubt that [[Australian rules football]] does not deserve a decent mention in this article, allow me to quote from the renowned Australian historian, [[Geoffrey Blainey]]:  ''Of the main codes of football played in the world, Australian Rules is one of the oldest.  By the normal definition of age, it is older than American football or Gridiron, older than Rugby League, older than the modern version of Gaelic Football from which it is widely said to have been descended, a little older than Association Football or Soccer, but younger than Rugby.  Few of the world's famous football clubs, irrespective of the specific code they play, are as old s the senior Australian football clubs such as Melbourne, Geelong and Carlton.  Even young clubs in the Victorian Football League such as Fitzroy and Footscray are older than any football club in such celebrated sporting nations as Italy and Germany and Argentina.''

I know from personal experience that rugby diehards from either rugby code have trouble with this notion:  they have trouble believing that Aussie rules was codified in [[1859]] and that [[Melbourne Football Club]], formed in the same year, is older than virtually every other football club of '''any''' code on [[Earth]].  So for an article that is about the origins of the modern football codes, and their early inter-connectedness, Aussie rules has an important place in that.  Also, remembering that the initial tension of the early forms of football was between running with the ball and kicking it, Australian and Gaelic football occupy an interesting middle road between these two early footballing philosophies, and thus a discussion on football generally is not complete without them.  But don't take my word for it, I encourage you to do your own research.

I would dispute your comment, older than rugby league-It should be older than "the" rugby league. Which is irrelevant anyway. Age is no indicator of prominence otherwise there would be a section dedicated entirely and purely to the Sheffield club. It is no more Austrlaian football than Rugby, though rugby be international and supported.

12:05, 23 February 2006 (UTC)[[User:Licinius|Licinius]]

Anyway the issue is that AFL is too prominent and needs to be downgraded. It is irrelevant for the most part to the developement of the more popular international codes of football and the NFL, which is what most English speakers associate with the word football and is what this article should be more about. Again I call for a non-Australian person interested in all codes of football to help re-write this.

12:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)[[User:Licinius|Licinius]]

*Please do some research on the state of football in the 1850s, and then come back and chat here because you will soon understand the prime position Australian rules has in the history of the modern football codes.  This is an article about football generally - it is not an article about the world's most popular football (which we all accept is soccer).  [[Association Football]] has its own article.  The genesis of all the modern football codes is in what was happening amongst the English public schools of the 1850s and the tension between the two main philosophies.  Aussie rules is a direct child of this period - its founders were all educated in the English public school system so they brought back with them some knowledge of all the various rules, including Rugby, and it shows - that is what makes it of interest in a history on football (generic term).  I simply ask you to compare what was happening in 1859 in terms of Aussie rules (codification of the rules and formation of the Melbourne Football Club - events of which original documents survive to the present day) and what was happening anywhere else in the world regarding any football code you care to mention.  That's what makes Aussie rules of historical interest.  If you can find anything else of interest happening in 1859 - please include it in this article - we will eagerly accept it!

*I have just had a reread of this article and I do not understand why you think Aussie rules is so prominent - I simply cannot see it.  In terms of the history of football, it rightly makes and early appearance after the public school forms I have mentioned - but that is its rightful spot in terms of history.  And can you honestly tell me that it is a large section?  Please reread the article and tell us which parts are too prominent.  As for the picture - it shows a football game from 1866, and as someone else has rightly observed, a representation of any football game from that period would look similar - none of the early versions are anything similar to their modern counterparts.

But it is irrelevant to the developement of the large international codes of footy and of cause the biggest average attendance per game league in the world, the NFL. It should be dramatically downgraded. I agree with Licinius, it is a mostly irrelevant code of football.

I have to agree with Licinius and J is me that in terms of the modern world, on a global scale, Aussie rules is a mostly irrelevant code of football. I'd say the same thing about Gaelic football, rugby league and Candian football. However, an encyclopedia like this is meant to be informative, not just speak about the most common things. It should describe variations in different parts of the world. As Pippu says, it should describe the history of all the codes, giving a bit of perspective even when the codes aren't directly related. Obviously this should be done in reasonable manner, not giving undue prominence to a relatively unknown code, but I find it very hard to see why you say that the article does this, especially since you haven't answered numerous requests to say exactly what the problem is.

Where are the rugby codes - don't bother looking them up, it's simply too embarassing.  Which reminds me of Factoid's boast on his user page, that he quashed the notion that Aussie rules is the most widely supported of the footy codes in Australia.  Of course we all know that he did no such thing, didn't come close.  Once he realised that aussie rules attendance is double that of league's (and nothing else comes remotely close) - he gave the lame excuse that that was to do with culture, and therefore we should look at other things like TV ratings.  But with the latest bid for TV rights by 7 and 10 making everything else look like the takings from a school fete, I'm not sure if there is much joy to be found there either.

Rugby League is not irrelevant internationally. Of cause it's golden international age was perhaps from 1930-1960 but for the past 5 years, the Russian Rugby League has attracted large audiences in Moscow(one game had 30,000 supporters watch the Russians beat the Americans), has got a 4.2 million dollar sponsorship in Jamaica, attracted decent audiences in Lebanon(>10000) for international games, attracted an audience of 5,000 in America for the Kangaroo-Tomahawks game in 2004 etc. and the Catalans in France recieved 11,000 spectators in their first match in the super league in a relatively small French coastal town of [[Perpignan]]. Hardly huge but I personally would not deem it irrelevant. That is not to mention the game's growth and organisation of conferences in areas the game did not previously exist(the English south and Home nations as well as in Holland, Serbia, Italy, Germany, etc.)

Furthermore the game is growing Internationally once more throughout its main nations through the Anzac test and the tri-nations tournament.

To pippu, Rugby Union is throughout many countries and its domestic leagues are normally secondary to the International games of which there is not a huge amount of. Rugby League in 1948-49 had more spectators in Northern England than the AFL has ever had in any one year,

Of which this is mostly irrelevant.

All we have heard to date is (about AFL):  it's a meaningless game, it's a pointless game in the scheme of things, or comments of that ilk.  We keep highlighting the place Aussie rules has had in the history of football (generic), and it's right up there with the places held by soccer and rugby.  That's not to say that it's bigger, or more important, or more popular, or better, or whatever - we are simply saying that its history is a long one and it needs to be mentioned in any discussion about the history of football (generic).  Just as in a discussion of the history of rock and roll, you may need to mention a few lesser lights, even if Elvis or whoever else will grab most of the limelight.

== Australian varieties of football ==

The Southern game is no more an Australian variation of football than Rugby. This has already been said and is indeniable. I believe the heading should be changed to rectify this, or else be coherent with the rest of the article and refer to those games as games descended from "Melbourne Rules" specifically. That is the micro of the specific argument.

Also I feel that it needs to be rewritten as their is too much emphasis on AFL when it is an irrelevant game to most speakers of English when they refer to football. This makes the article misleading to people researching football. I feel it should be a small paragraph as compared to the other codes.

Dude, give it up. Aussie Rules was invented in Australia, is played by Australians and has a strong following in Australia and no other country. If that doesn't make it an Australian sport I don't know what does. Let it go.

:It has been said and denied, so it is hardly undeniable. You seem to think that the phrase "Australian variety of football" means a variation that is played in and is important in Australia. By that meaning, obviously aussie rules, rugby league and possibly union are no more or less Australian than each other. However, Aussie rules is also Australian in a different sense - it originated in Australia (and is for the most part, hasn't spread). We could argue about whether this means that overall it is more an Australian variety or not, but there would be no point in that discussion, since in the context of this article, the phrase "Australian variety of football" is clearly talking about where the game originated. Describing Aussie rules as an Australian variety does not imply that Australians don't play league/rugby/soccer, anymore than describing Gaelic as an Irish game implies the same about the Irish! I can see how using similar wording to the other headings might be necessary for someone who has trouble understanding context, but your suggestion isn't helpful, as the codes grouped together at the moment are not all descended from on set of rules, and "Melbourne Rules" has never been used as a name for the rules you are referring to anyway.

:As for the article as a whole, two points: Firstly, when most English speakers mention football, they are probably thinking of only one variety, so the whole article is irrelevant to them. This article is for people interested in all the forms of football and how they do and don't interact with each other. Secondly, the Australian football section ''is'' smaller than the amount written on all the other codes, except perhaps rugby league.

I agree with you there but I feel that it would take a comphrehensive re-write to achieve this. Rugby and the games descended from it as well as soccer are by far the two biggest styles of football in the world.

== What? ==

Personnel insults are superfluous Grant. The term "Rugby League" and most of the modern rule changes to it originated in Australia. Australian Rules did not originate in Australia, but was a combination of different English games including Rugby and was made by foreigners. It is a distinctly Southern game with most of its top League teams being originally Victorian. It is a third rate game in the most populated state and the third most populated states of Australia, played by virtually noone in Sydney. It is hardly an Australian variety, definitely no more than Rugby League.
:Yeah, yeah, whatever. Australian rules is a combination of [[Great Britain|British]], [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] games, not just [[England|English]] games.  By your logic [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Australians of British descent]] are not Australian at all, we are British. (*Quickly recovers from choking on coffee.*) By your logic Aboriginal Australians with any British ancestry would also be British. You may be surprised to learn that Sydney, great city that it is, is not representative of Australia. Nevertheless ''991,000 people in Sydney'' watched the TV broadcast of the [[Sydney Swans]] winning the [[AFL Grand Final]]'' last year.

Which, for my small impart, still makes it a third rate sport compared to Rugby, Rugby Union and of cause soccer which have all recorded higher audiences, Rugby and Rugby Union on several occasions. By any reasoning that rating was a one off, unlikely to be repeated, many times more people have attended the Sydney AFL team than in fact have watched it on T.V. 

Just my small say, you can keep talking crap Grant and Licinius, haha.

The vote of 130.130.37.6 is not admissable as it does not come from a registered user. Neither is 60.225.200, and another user suspects that it is also used by The man from OZ (see [[User talk:60.225.200.50]]). On 24 February, J is me said: ''''"Yes I know the man from oz and Licinius and I in fact sometimes even share a computer with them..."'''' This means that they, at the very least, fit the technical definition of sockpuppets and are disqualified from voting. (I have reported all of the suspected/self-confessed sockpuppets.) Therefore all but one of the "disagree" votes may be disregarded. The vote so far is four to one in favour of the proposition. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 03:31, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

All on your say so Grant. To make such comments would normally need a very clear indication of where the basis of them is in Wikipedian policy. Such as "technical sockpuppetry" and disqualifying non users from voting. What proof is there that you and Pippu are not one and the same yourself? Definitely Raresaturn is probably a sockpuppet of yours. You are both obviously saying the same thing. Personally I am surprised that you have not accused 130.130.37.6 of being a sockpuppet as well, seeing that he does not agree with you. --[[User:The man from OZ|The man from OZ]] 07:04, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

As an aside, in future, let us be sure that whenever someone queries what is written in this article (to which I have contributed nothing), that they actually do have a thorough understanding of the history of all the football codes before we get into any debates.

:Yes, I think it is an excellent article, thanks largely to the work of Mintguy. Other users have suggested that it be given featured status.

::"So far you have lost"?

If you use protection for too long, two things happen:
* 1. people who could be editing the article drift off and do something else.
* 2. those who remain become addicted to arguing and treat the protected state as desirable.

I'm going again to unprotect to give editing a chance.  The article has been protected for nearly four weeks, which makes it the longest period of protection on the wiki for an article that isn't actually the subject of an arbitration case (and I regard that as a poor excuse for prolonged protections, too).

::1. referring to your first point above:  "people who could be editing the article drift off and do something else" - to that I say:  great!  that's precisely what we are hoping will happen!
::2. referring to Licinius/J is me/Man of oz and associated parties (and I apologise if I have got the names wrong, but we all know about whom I am referring), I wish to provide some gratuitous advice.  When organising sock puppets, you  should not end up with a situation where all the personae share the same attributes, for example, of someone having just failed HSC English.  Try and mix up the attributes a bit, for example, one could sound like a stuffy, pedantic academic; another could sound like a kid who has just left school at age 15 and is semi-literate (although at times you nearly succeeded in imitating that one very well); another could sound like someone accustomed to falling asleep at the back of a lecture hall; another could sound like a deadpan, boring accountant (like me, for instance).

Interesting article in today's SMH on the use of the term "Football" in Australia.  Quite pertinent.  If I didn't know any better, I would almost swear that the writer has frequented this talk page and other talk pages where this subject has arisen. Also interesting that an article in a Sydney newspaper should essentially be reinforcing many of the points we have made above on the historical significance of aussie rules.

:Those of you who did not get a chance to track this article down, allow me to quote one small part (and please recall that this was in a '''Sydney''' paper):  
:''The historian Geoffrey Blainey points out in his book ''A Game of Our Own'' that the oldest Australian rules football clubs predate any notable soccer club anywhere in the world. (The top six are Melbourne 1858, Geelong 1859, Notts County 1862, Stoke City 1863, Carlton 1864, Nottingham Forest 1865).''
:''"Middle-aged" AFL clubs like Essendon and St Kilda are older than any senior clubs in Germany and Argentina. A "young" club like Collingwood (1892) is older than any Italian soccer club, and Port Adelaide (1870) older than any Brazilian club.''
:I repeat, in an article that covers the history of football, including (in particular) the history of its organisation, its institutions, its rules, etc.  the fact that the Australian football clubs are so old in world terms is certainly of note and should be mentioned in this article.  In fact I note that a list of the oldest football clubs in the world is not shown, and I wonder whether it should be squeezed in somewhere (not sure where).  Certain contributors to this talk page (and I use that term reservedly) should note the age of the Port Adelaide footy club:  [[1870]], which is extremely old in its own right, and hopefully is another wet blanket on the lie that Australian Football is merely a Victorian game (I know, even it it were, it is still Australian, but don't tell me, tell you know who...).

==Linking to pages==
Just wondering since the official page for soccer is [[football (soccer)]], should everything pointing to other codes of football be named in the convention such as [[football (Australian rules)]], [[football (rugby union)]], [[football (rugby league)]] etc, or should we have the pages by their official real-world title - ie, [[Australian rules football]], [[Association football]], [[Rugby union]], [[Rugby league]] etc? Seems a case of double standards if the official Wikipedia association football page is located at [[football (soccer)]] when that is not the official name of the sport. <b><font color="darkblue">[[WP:AFL|R]]</font><font color="red">[[Special:Contributions/Rogerthat|o]]</font><font color="darkblue">[[User:Rogerthat|gerthat]]</font></b> ''<sup><font color="black">[[User_talk:Rogerthat|Talk]]</font></sup>'' 10:17, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
: I certainly agree with the latter suggestion - but there seems to be a general reluctance amongst the soccer community to use [[Association football]] as there official name, and thus their crusade to appropriate the term [[Football]] as meaning only soccer.  I think this is at the heart of the problem. If they were to use only [[Association football]], we would never need to have any of these discussions.

:Further to this last point, I just thought I would cite a few references.  My Chambers Dictionary (which I believe is British) defines '''Football''' as ''1 any of several team games played with a large ball... 2 the ball used in the game''.  Then my 1969 Columbia Encyclopedia refers to '''Football''' in terms of what it means in the USA (i.e. Gridiron) with barely a sentence dedicated to other codes.  However, it does have an entry for '''Soccer''':  ''outdoor ball and goal game, also called Association Football''.  So, what do I conclude from this?  In an English language wikipedia we are correct in only ever using the term [[Football]] as a generic word to describe a variety of related games - the fact that much of the world thinks football is only soccer is irrelevant - this is the English language wikipedia.  Secondly, the round ball game has two very good names to describe it, both of which will be found in all the major sources, but adherents don't want to use either of them.  Why?  It can only be because of a desire to appropriate the broader term completely for their own use.  In both historical and contemporary terms (in the English speaking world), this is an incorrect use of the term.  Arguing that football = Association football only is a bit like arguing that music = classical music only.  Many will try and say it, but it is not correct.

--[[User:202.7.176.133|202.7.176.133]] 22:44, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
Agreed.  Also the line in the article "In most English-speaking countries, the word "football" usually refers to Association football, also known as soccer (soccer originally being a slang abbreviation of Association)."  Is clearly wrong.  Most English speaking countries are refering to their own code when the say Football.  The UK is the only English speaking country which means soccer when they say football.  Australia, NZ, South Africa, USA & Canada all use the term Football to mean something else.  I propose that this be amended in the article.
:No, and this has come up several times before. See [[football (word)]]: "''Of the 48 national FIFA affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, only five — Canada, the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Samoa and the United States — use soccer in their name, while the rest use football. However, even in the countries where "football" is the official name of association football, this name may be at odds with common usage, and this is the case in Australia, for example, where the common name is soccer.''" Thanks to the British Empire a.k.a. the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], there are a lot of English-speaking countries. 

:Also, the use of "football" to mean soccer is prevalent in countries which do not have English as a main language, but still have huge numbers of English speakers, such as [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 23:00, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

Do you not like our one and only indigenous football code, our truly national football code, worked out by trial and error in the paddocks surrounding the MCG around 1858-59, the game having spread to South Australia, Tasmania and southern New South Wales within a decade and its father figure being in fact a New South Welshman,  retaining the descriptor "Australian"?

The point I am trying to make is that the game is descended from a distinct set of rules and to present it as such would be in line with how the other codes of football are presented. --[[User:Licinius|Licinius]] 05:57, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

*'''Disagree'''. This debate would  be like talking to a brick wall or some equally dense object, if a brick wall were capable of harbouring the same hostility to a code of football that Licinius clearly does. Firstly, the word "football" in itself is applied to various codes in Australia, but "Australian Rules Football" is the common name, worldwide. There is no such thing as codes called "Australian Soccer", "Australian Rugby" (etc) which could be confused with Australian Rules Football. Second, [[Marn Grook]] is not descended from Australian rules or Gaelic football. Third, neither soccer nor rugby union, no rugby league (in its various forms), or any other major code originated in Australia. Fourth (a minor point), Gaelic football is a descendant of earlier Irish codes, there is not really much that is descended from it.

Marn Crook could go down as an Australian variation of football as this is how the other ancient codes are presented. However although this game might perhaps have inspired the original Melbourne rules to some extent, the other codes are presented as from a distinct code of rules and so should the AFL be presented. --[[User:Licinius|Licinius]] 05:57, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

This is especially the case as most readers are likely to assume that it has something to do with football as played at the time of Queen Victoria.

It must be hard for you to fathom Grant, but noone outside Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia really care about AFL. Swans supporters and Brisbane supporters are mostly immigrants from those states, sons of immigrants from those states and rent a crowd type of ignorants. In NSW and QLD, Rugby is the national game, oh and curiously the most supported club in Australia was the Brisbane Broncos according to a poll done 2 years ago. The very term "Rugby League" is Australian, which makes it as Australian as the Victorian game which really did not create any distinct aspect to football diferent to how it was played at the time. But this is irrelevant:

The question only asks that AFL should be presented in line with how the other codes such as American football are presented. --[[User:Licinius|Licinius]] 04:53, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
::Yes, and most of those eligible to vote (suspected sockpuppets included; IP numbers excluded) disagree with you. 

::In fact the term "rugby league" was first used in England in 1901, i.e. the "Northern Rugby League", which was a competition. The NSWRL was merely the first organisation to use the term. I should know, since I wrote a large part of the [[History of rugby league]] article. On that subject, why don't you have a look through that article for AFL propaganda?

::So it was 991,000 southern immigrants who watched the 2005 AFL grand final on TV in Sydney? That was the official viewing figure. I also don't think you comprehend the lack of interest in rugby league in states other than NSW and Queensland, although 500,000 people did watch the NRL grand final on TV in Melbourne, where they would watch two flies crawling up the wall if it was billed a major sporting event :-).

Sorry, I know the truth hurts. Grant65 | Talk 18:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)", unwikipedian among other things. Assuming bad faith from the beginning.

Collaboration? joke? It is in line with how the other codes are presented though it is arguable that AFL is a game descended from either Rugby School Rules, or Sheffield rules. Do any of you seriously consider that AFL is any more distinctly Australian than the NFL is distinctly American? Do you deny the impact that Australians (born here and abroad) have had on the rules of Rugby League? Which is not any less than the changes that the Victorian Rules were to the manner of football played at the time. Seriously look at the different codes and their rules and the Victorian game as it first was which is not so different? Though those last three points are only slightly relevant and a bit irrelevant to the case in hand, which is that like the different codes of football are presented as games descended from original codes of rules that made them distinct, so should AFL be presented as a game descended in like manner.

The proposed change is in line with how the article is presented, very simply, and most of these comments and accusations are unfair and do not indicate how I feel. Do you think that I am any less disgusted at the cultural cringe that tries to steal the word '''"football"''' from it's rightful place. Do you think I am not proud that as an Australian, the code played in the Southern states has a much higher support base per capita and in deed a higher average attendance than the Premier League? Or do not see the day when Rugby League will be the same.
Do you think that I do not look in scorn at those that talk in such a manner about football when in fact Sydney is the '''THIRD BIGGEST FOOTBALL CITY IN THE WORLD''' and Melbourne the '''biggest''', the second being London which is a vastly bigger population with a much smaller area? I like soccer but it simply cannot arouse support throughout it's heartlands like Rugby and AFL can.

The simple fact is that that is how the article is presented and although I pay AFL out as a relatively minor game, it was only in response to the jest I got orininally. --[[User:Licinius|Licinius]] 11:45, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

Licinius, the more you explain your position, the more I think you're reading something into the current wording that just plain isn't there. Saying Aussie Rules is an Australian variety of football does not say that it is more Australian than "gridiron" (NFL is the competition, not the game!) is American. It doesn't say that Australians haven't had great influence on rugby league. The descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact ''shouldn't'' be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. The different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their "ancestry" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin. Saying some of them are Australian varieties of football is not saying the rugby codes are  "unAustralian" any more than calling Gaelic football an Irish variety implies that Irish soccer players are not Irish/Gaelic! [[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 12:57, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

:JPD said '''' "gridiron" (NFL is the competition, not the game!) ''''.  Gridiron is the name of the field use to play the sport of American Football.  Also, in the USA is it quite common to refer to the league.  You wouldn't start a game of NFL in your back yard but you might watch an NFL game on tv.  Just a side note,  just because aussie rules fans have such a big problem with people referring to the league/governing body doesn't mean normal people do.

:::Yes, I know gridiron originally referred to the field, but now it is commonly used in Australia to refer to the game.

== Conduct in this article. ==

As a user who couldn't make edits (under the blocked username of [[User:Jebus Christ]]) I have been watching this debate unfold for some time.

I've been refusing to make contributions here out of sheer protest of my username being blocked.  Out of sheer disgust, based on what i've seen here i've decided to swallow my pride and come back.

The conduct from people on both sides of the debate has been absolutely Apauling.  While I don't necessarily agree with Licinius', the tactics of the power stoned Aussie Rules fraternity have been far more underhanded than any sock puppeteer could ever hope to be.

Am I correct in noting that every single person who voted against the aussie rules fraternity has been accused of being a sock puppet of licinius?  For some of these there may be some sort of reason to suspect this but for others there was no reason other than the way they voted.  Grant65, I accuse you of making sockpuppet accusations in BAD FAITH.

And why is it that those who make the same accusation against Grant65 have automatically been accused of bad faith?  Is it a mere coincidence that the perpetrator of this is none other than an administrator from Grant65's home state and a member of the Aussie Rules fraternity?

Administrator Snottygobble, I accuse you of looking after your mates, of being biased and of not being fit to be a wikipedia administrator.

To the Aussie Rules fraternity in general, I accuse you of partaking in organised bullying and of using bullying tactics to monopolise this article both now and in the past.

Licinius, I think you've been driven to do much of what you're accused of.  Maybe you have sockpuppets, maybe you don't.  Maybe you acted in bad faith, maybe you didn't.  But one thing is for certain, regardless of whether you are right, you didn't have a fair chance to state your case.  You've been bullied, outnumbered and railroaded.  You've had your words twisted and your vote hijacked.  My advice to you is round up as much support for your cause as you can and then accept the final verdict whatever it is.  And please don't run off with your tail between your legs if you lose.  Stick around and lets try to build the number of non-afl appolegists contributing to this article.

[[User:Jimididit|Jimididit]] 14:14, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
: "Bias"? Methinks he doth protest too much. The similarities to Licinius's style of writing are duly noted. (Maybe he has a split personality rather than sockpuppets.)  Or it could be another person in denial, from the Australian rugby league fraternity. I'm keeping my options open re a sockpuppet tag.

: I see Jimididit has attempted to round up support on talk pages relating to codes other than Aussie rules. Unfortunately for you guys (or guy), its unlikely that non-Australians even understand what we're arguing about, or the so-called point (apparently a personal grudge against me) that Licinius is twisting Wikipedia pages to make. "Power stoned"? Well I'm certainly enjoying being part of majority opinion, that's for sure. Licinius has had his fun, holding up editing on this page for months, a classic case of a tail wagging a dog, so don't make me laugh with attempted gibes about "power trips".

: "Am I correct in noting that every single person who voted against the aussie rules fraternity has been accused of being a sock puppet of licinius?" No, you are completely wrong. I haven't accused Tancred or Factoid Killer, among others, largely because I know them from other pages.

: Licinius/J is me/Man from Oz have admitted that they use the same computer and sometimes edit under IP numbers. That is prima facie evidence of sockpuppets. Furthermore, J is me has now received an indefinite ban for various transgressions. Don't complain to me about bad faith. Anyone who is innocent of sockpuppetry has nothing to fear from such an accusation.

: For the record, Snottygobble and I have never met, and we have barely exchanged a word on Wipipedia pages, except for me complaining about one of his edits. I'd love to see evidence that we are bosom buddies, coz it just ain't there. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 16:32, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

Grant65 Said ''''Maybe he has a split personality rather than sockpuppets.''''  So was this comment in good faith?

Grant65 Said ''''I see Jimididit has attempted to round up support on talk pages relating to codes other than Aussie rules.'''' The only support i've attempted to round up is for a general contribution to this article.  I believe the contributions are unbalanced and that the article could use some contributions from people from other backgrounds.  There are too many aussie rules pundits contributing to this article in comparison to supporters of other codes.  I have not participated in this vote and don't intend to.

Grant65 said ''''Well I'm certainly enjoying being part of majority opinion'''' Isn't it funny how everyone else with that opinion is a self confessed AFL fan?  Where's the mix of opinions?  What hapenned to all of the soccer people?  Beaten off with a stick no doubt.

Grant65 Said ''''Unfortunately for you guys (or guy), its unlikely that non-Australians even understand what we're arguing about,'''' Well that's irrelevant since I have no intention of dragging people into this argument.

Grant65 Said ''''I haven't accused Tancred or Factoid Killer, among others'''' What others?  And what evidence do you have that NSWelshman is a sockpuppet of licinius?  Did you even bother to investigate?  Suggest you take a look at his user page [[User:NSWelshman]].

Grant65 Said ''''Furthermore, J is me has now received an indefinite ban for various transgressions.'''' Yeah I noticed that.  Apparently he visited a different country this time because the new ip address comes from a completely different country to the old one!

Grant65 Said ''''Don't complain to me about bad faith. Anyone who is innocent of sockpuppetry has nothing to fear from such an accusation. '''' Right.  And anyone accusing you of sock puppetry is accused of bad faith and blocked!  Everyone else needs to provide evidence.  Basically, everyone other than you has to wear a suspected sockpuppet tag until they're investigated.  And they're supposed to be happy to ignore it because they have nothing to fear unless they're guilty?  Grant65, I accuse you of accusing NSWelshman of being a sockpuppet in BAD FAITH.  He even gave you the means to investigate your claim.  He pointed you to the state of origin page where he has made edits.

Grant65 said ''''I'd love to see evidence that we are bosom buddies, coz it just ain't there'''' The evidence stronger than your evidence of sock puppeteering.  What lead me to this conclusion are the following events/facts...
# Snottygobble is part of the AFL fraternity as are you
# Snottygobble is from Western Australia as are you
# Snottygobble was very quick to amend your page after an anonymous user accused you of being a sock puppet
# Snottygobble was very quick to block J is me even though the ip address used came from a different country
# Snottygobble was very quick to amend the pages of his other AFL buddies
# Snottygobble stopped short of amending the pages of several users who voted licinius' way.  In fairness you undid this today but I don't understand why Snottygobble only corrected the pages of his mates.

Since being unfairly blocked for my own username by some admin on a power trip I am making it my mission to hold such people accountable.  I'm sure it won't be difficult to round up support from other mistreated wikipedeans [[User:Jimididit|Jimididit]] 17:16, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

:The debate may have been a little rough but I can't see the problem really. Grant65 is correct that a non-Australian can't even understand this issue. Australian rules football is called 'Australian Rules Football', most people in the UK wouldn't have a clue what 'Victorian football' was (Is that something to do with history?) or 'Melbourne football' (Where's that?). Wiki should reflect what reality is not what people think it should be.
:I'd also take another look at those protesting if I were you. As has been pointed out they all sign their names incorrectly. I've never seen anybody else sign that way. [[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 21:31, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

GordyB that is a fair point we all signed wrongly. Blame Licinius, he showed me how to sign and than I showed J is me. If you do not believe me you can go to Licinius's talk page where I left a message long before this poll began. What is this crap about technical sockpuppetry? It is not mentioned on either the vote page or the sockpuppet page. Grant65 has just made it up IN BAD FAITH to attempt to manipulate the vote. --[[User:The man from OZ|The man from OZ]] 07:22, 23 March 2006 (UTC)


::Grant65's point is irrelevant.  As I said earlier I am not trying to gather support for licinius' vote.  I'm trying to get people from outside of AFL Australia to contribute to this article. [[User:Jimididit|Jimididit]] 22:47, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
:::But as Grant has previously pointed out, the original main contributor to this article was an Englishman, Mintguy, who understood the history of football.  I repeat again, this article is as good a summation of the history of football as you are likely to find anywhere, and it is impossible to say that aussie rules is somehow favoured or dominates the article - it doesn't come close to doing that.

:::::Ah come off it.  It's only a matter of weeks since we successfully managed to replace the aussie rules picture as the main image for this article!

::::::Fair go Factoid - we've just said that an Englishman wrote most of the article and you've just replied harshly to the views of another Englishman with no interest in AFL.  The picture you refer to was neither here or there - it was an engraving of a football game from 1866 - it could have been any code from that era - because around 1866 the codes would have all looked very similar to the casual observer.  For instance, at that time there was still a lot of ball handling allowed in Association Football, and aussie rules was yet to settle on the shape of the ball (basically because balls were not mass produced and you played with whatever you could get your hands on).  Also, the aussie rules of that era would have been virtually indistinguishable from the rugby of the era.  So when people complain about an engraving of a football game from 1866 as somehow favouring one code or the other, or giving it undue prominence, they are showing a gross ignorance of the general history of football.

::::::::So let me get this straight, a couple of League fans are jealous that the historical picture heading a fine and balanced article happens to reference Aussie Rules and in retaliation to this affront they have it removed and now want to deface the small Aussie Rules section by replacing the name with a word no-one uses?

:::::::::It's funny (no, ironic) to think that I wrote a good part of [[History of rugby league]] &mdash; even though I knew little about that code beforehand &mdash; just over a year ago, because none of the Australian Wikipedia editors were interested! I even appealed at the Australian editors' noticeboard for help. Now the Aussie league fundamentalists have come out of the woodwork to attack an article which dares to mention Australian rules by its proper name and accord it the proper historical importance.

I think we'd all be happy to have more non-Australian input to the article. It is already good, but that doesn't mean there's no room for improvement. Unfortunately, I have a feeling that an awful lot of non-Australians who see this want to stay well clear because they see a whole load of ridiculous conversations going on on this talk page, mainly about things that aren't worth discussing. I'm not claiming that anyone has been perfect, and it's not worth arguing about who started it, but somehow now most of the discussion seems to be attacking each other rather than discussing the article. There have been, and still are, opportunities for the shire boys to put their points and answer the constructive repsonses that their comments have received, if they want to. However, as I said before, if they and the rest of us keep responding angrily to the more silly statements and accusations (whether they were intended as good faith humour or are the result of users being fed up with the silly arguments), then we're not going to get anywhere. As someone who has been insulted personally or collectively by both "sides" of the argument, can I ask that everyone actually listen to the points other users are making, and not assume that every point made is evidence of a "fraternity" with an agenda - these sort of assumptions are what lead to people taking sides. [[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 12:48, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

I dispute the result due to the fact that one user has been banned on no real basis. J is me was banned first for doing no more than what Grant65 had done, though admittedly in my opinion acting in bad faith, and now has been banned for logging in "anonymously" with out any evidence. Snottygobble is out of line. Anyhow this has robbed one potential voter and in my opinion was completely deliberate. Also I object to some of the votes on the basis that they have been ids created since the first poll began. I have already objected to this --[[User:Licinius|Licinius]] 06:03, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

It is not clear. Several of the voters were new identities and as such contestable. Also judging by the comments, very few actually knew what the poll was about. --[[User:Licinius|Licinius]] 13:06, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

::Grant, You still haven't answered any of my questions.  The number 1 question i'd like answered is why NSWelshman was blocked.  What evidence do you have of sockpuppetry.

==The Age of reason==
There have been two articles that have appeared in the sports section of The Age newspaper over the last two days that are of great interest to us.  In yesterday's edition, I read that Australia Post is about to release a series of stamps to celebrate the Socceroos' attempt to embark on the impossible dream (not meaning to be disrespectful, simply an honest assessment).  This new series of stamps is entitled "Soccer in Australia".  When the General Manager of Australia Post was asked why use the term "soccer", he simply said that it was Australia Post's view that that is the name used by the majority of Australians, and that the word football is saved for  the more dominant code of a particular area, i.e. aussie rules or league.

In today's edition, there was a great article about the proposal to heritage list the Melbourne Football Club, the oldest football club in Australia (in any code) and the third oldest in the world (in any code).  It was formed in 1858, the year in which we have the first recorded game of aussie rules, the game being codified in the following year, making the game older than Association Football.  Interestingly, it was once thought that the Geelong Football Club was the second oldest club in Australia (formed in July 1859), but there is now new evidence indicating that the Castlemaine Football Club was in fact formed in June 1859.  That makes it the 5th oldest club in the world, and Geelong the 6th oldest club in the world.  
I can't recall where we list the oldest football clubs in the world, but this is what The Age says:
#Guy's Hospital Rugby Club, London, 1843
#Sheffield Football Club, Sheffield, 1857
#Melbourne Football Club, Melbourne, Australia, 1858
#Blackheath Rugby, London, 1858
#Castlemaine Football Club, Castlemaine, Australia, June 1859
#Geelong Football Club, Geelong, Australia, July 1859
#Hallam Football Club, Sheffield, 1860
#Notts County, Nottingham, 1862
(although I would have thought that Carlton Football Club was pre 1862).  [[User:Pippu d'angelo|ρ¡ρρµ δ→θ∑]] - [[:scn:User talk:Pippu d'Angelo|<small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small>]] 04:37, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

==The number of english language Fifa affiliates using football==
Ok, I don't really want to get into this too much, but basically when I was reading that section it hit me that the Marshall Islands is not a FIFA affiliate (a quick check confirmed this).  Anyway another user alerted me to the original discussion where this info came from ([[Talk:Football_%28soccer%29/%28archive_2%29#More_about_the_name_2|here]]), and so another quick check (against [http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/na/index.html here]) showed that Kiribati and Micronesia also aren't, so that's why I've changed it to 45.  Also mentioned that the Samoan Federation has a stupid official name which uses both (Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation) - though I didn't actually use the word stupid for [[WP:NPOV]] purposes. Hope this isn't contentious. [[User:Cursive|Cursive]] 00:36, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

Ok, New Zealand has changed its name from New Zealand Soccer to New Zealand Football, I live in New Zealand and have seen the results. The All Whites have been given new shirts.

==Touch rugby==
To avert an edit war, the recent edits are incorrect. See the long and messy discussion at [[Talk:Touch football (rugby league)]]. Basically the code that people in Europe usually mean when they refer to "touch rugby" ''is'' the code that Australians call "Touch" or "touch football". Unlike Australians, Europeans generally refer to both union and league simply as "rugby". There are different versions of touch rugby and the Australian-invented Touch is the most popular form worldwide.  [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 13:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

== Addition of "Universal Rules" ==

I add this in process of Wikipedia. I have added the code that was an attempt to unite Australia's two forms of football, Rugby League and Australian Rules. It seems incredible but there is a link to respected Rugby historian Sean Fagan's homepage who researched it. [[User:I who have sinned|I who have sinned]] 13:27, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== Oldest football club ==

Under "Other developments in the 1850s", we have the claim that Dublin University Football Club is the oldest club, being founded in 1854. However, under "The establishment of modern codes of football", we see the claim that Guy's Hospital Football Club was founded in London in 1843. It would appear that the latter can claim to be the oldest club - unless some knows different? [[User:Markb|Markb]] 13:37, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

:According to most rugby books Guy's is the oldest. However the [[rugby union]] article states that Dublin University is the oldest documented club i.e. Guy's say they were founded in 1843 but there aren't very many documents that prove this, nor is it clear that Guy's were always in existance. They might have started up, folded and got going again.[[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 14:09, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== Master rules ==

Added [[Masters Australian Football ]] rules to Irish and Australian varieties of football as it has sufficient points of difference, and is widely enough spread to qualify as its own variety.

==Derivation of the word football==

"...there is a rival explanation, which has it that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot.[1]"

Can someone please provide a valid reference for this?  The one provided doesn't work.  To me that explanation sounds like a rugby or American football fan trying to justify their use of the term football, not a valid history of the word.  Otherwise why don't lacrosse, hockey and numerous other ball games played on foot include the word football?[[User:Bombot|Bombot]] 12:10, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

They use hands in soccer don't they. The first rules of soccer had marks and all forms of football have had different degrees of handling. As for Rugby, every play starts with a foot to the ball. 11:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

:I have changed the reference. Accepting that explanation, the sport which became the various versions of football would have been called football before lacrosse, hockey, etc existed as distinct sports, by which time the name was used in a more specific manner.

== Australian Rules ==

Most of the teams are Victorians and the players are either Victorian, South Australian or Western Australian. 10 of the 16 teams in the competition are Victorian. There are only two teams in NSW and QLD whose players re all Victorians(to such an extent that the remnant is negligible). QLD and NSW is half the nation. The GF is always played in Victoria. Everything about the game almost is Victorian. In fact often more people go to the games in Sydney(which have an entertaining circus atmosphere) than watch it on t.v. in Sydney. Everything about the code is Victorian as opposed to being Australian. [[User:Mr nice guy|Mr nice guy]] 12:07, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

*The article is talking about the game Aussie Rules (as well as various derivatives and Marn Grook). You seem to be talking about it's top level competition, the AFL.
*Being Victorian has not ever been opposed to being Australian, whatever we might think of our southern neighbours.
*Saying that it is an Australian variety of football does not imply that it is played/watched by the whole nation.
*It is the dominant code of football in many places that are not Victoria.
*Calling it a "Victorian variety" is confusing to an international audience.
*Overall, I have some sympathy for the idea that "Irish and Australian varieties" is (too) vague, but replacing Australian with Victorian makes the heading worse, not better.
*(Also, your comments about carnival atmosphere and Victorian players seem stuck in the 80s. Only 16 of the 38 players on the Swans' list are Victorian!) [[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 13:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

The game was no different to how football was played in Britain at the time, it is not really Australian in that sense, so Victorian is also apt for that reason too. The game is derived from Victorian rules. Marn Grook really does not deserve a mention as a code or variety of football because there is no evidence it was anything more than a bit of a kick and catch with colours. We will have to disagree about being Victorian and being Australian are different. A Victorian is an Australian but an Australian is not a Victorian. No it does not imply that but when the game is distictly Victorian it should be called as such. Calling it Australian is confusing to a Sydney and QLD audience. Those states are under the Victorian shadow. How many are from Sydney than?And there is definitely a circus atmosphere. [[User:Mr nice guy|Mr nice guy]] 03:49, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

*It is probably true that the original football played in Melbourne, Victoria was not more different from British versions of the time than they were from each other. The reason it came to be described as Victorian or Australian is that it evolved separately in Australia to become a very distinct game.
*I agree that Marn Grook should not be listed in the "Football Today" section.
*We don't have to disagree about Victorian and Australian being different. I never said they were they same. I am Australian, and I am definitely not Victorian. However, as you say, being Victorian is not opposed to being Australian, because Victorians are Australians.
*The game has not been distinctly Victorian for well over 100 years. The only ways in which it is Victorian is that a New South Welshman helped invent it in Melbourne, and the Victorian Football League became strong enough to take over the top-level running of the game nationally.
*Calling it Australian is not confusing at all. I am part of the Sydney audience, and it doesn't confuse me! I understand it to mean it is an Australian game. It doesn't say that it is the only variety of football played in Australia!
*"Victorian shadow"??? I personally feel that the Victorians do have too much influence in the AFL, but that is irrelevant to the fact that Australian rules is the dominant code of football in many places outside Victoria, including places that could hardly be described as under the Victorian shadow by any other criteria. 
*I'm not going to keep discussing the Swans, because even if the game were not played at all in Sydney/Qld, it would still not be fair to call it Victorian, so it is not relevant to this discussion. If you wish to talk about Swans players or the "circus atmosphere" (when did you last go to a game?), please use my talk page. [[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 08:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

*First point granted. But it should also be remembered to perhaps a lesser extent this is also the same in Rugby League.
*My point about Marn Grook is that to the best of my understanding, it was not really any more than a game played to a certain extent ad lib.
*We do not refer to codes that originated from the Rugby school English varities but we call them Rugby varieties. Same with association.
*Calling it an Australian variety is factually incorrect because it is distinctly regional. When I go to a Swan's game(which I do occasionslly as a sport's lover do), I am going to watch the Victorian team in Sydney play their variety of football.
*Victorian shadow?? perhaps that was a bit over the top, but I have no doubt that I have more in commen culturally with someone from NZ or the Islands beacuse they play Rugby than I do with people from Melbourne and the other two because their main idea of football is the Victorian code.
*The last time I went to game was last year :). I was actually told in my youth to support Collingwood because they were Victoria's [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]. I do not really mind the code despite the bile being thrown at me.

If I can provide an explanation for the present state of affairs, the earliest versions of this page were about soccer, followed by a redirect to [[football (soccer)]], and then it was a kind of disambiguation page. The main author of the present material, Mintguy, merged [[history of football]] into this article, for a number of reasons: e.g. that name ("history of football") was beset with the same disambiguation problems as "football" and there was a tendency for the various football codes to each claim the ancient/medieval football games as their own, when those games are the common ancestors, the gene pool for more than one modern game. I'm not sure where we would move the present content if this was a disambiguation page(?) [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 04:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
:Most English dictionaries (be that British, Australian or American) will define "football" as describing a group of related games which share certain features (even if some will also include an entry equating Football with [[Association Football]], since the latter is simply one variation of football).   People are incorrect in assuming that Football = Association Football at all times in all the English speaking countries of the world.  It simply is not true, and in any event, it was the British that first coined the term ''soccer'' as an abbreviation of Association Football.  Finally, one can find all the varieties of football from this page anyway, so it in effect serves both purposes, i.e. a discussion on football generally (which is clearly required as an article in its own right) and means of finding a particular code of football.

:::This might be a possible solution, but it still doesn't sit easy with me.

So that does not necessarily help you, because for a long period there '''has''' been a consensus to maintain a main article on Football (being a term used around the world to describe a group of related games).  Now you might say that most of the world understands "Football" to mean [[Association Football]] (which is its correct title), but this is the English language wikipedia, and it is untrue to say that most of the English speaking world understands "Football" to be [[Association Football]].  On the contrary, most of the English speaking world understands "Football" to mean their local variety of football - this is especially true when one throws in the USA, but it applies equally to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa.  Indeed even in Wales, you might get an argument about whether "Football" means specifically [[Association Football]].

I have serious problems with the paragraph as it stands. It implies that the Sheffield clubs played their own version of football for 20 years then swaped over to the FA rules. This is a gross inaccuracy. Many of the features of the Sheffield game were incorperated into the FA rules in the years leading up to 1978, including free kicks, crossbars, corners and the abolishment of hacking. While it is accurate to say that sheffield clubs adopted the FA rules in 1978, this ignores the previous 8 years of compremise between the 2 organisations.

:::"Converge" might be better - we have to accept that at the time (mid 1850s) there were a variety of rules, there was a fair bit of cross-fertilisation, and the modern codes of football that emerged soon after  were often influenced by more than one of the earlier codes (that is certainly the case with both aussie rules and association football).  Rugby is the only one to have grown from its own earlier code with the same name, but given the amount of common terminology that exists across all the modern codes, it too would have been influenced by other codes, even if to a lesser extent.  Sheffield rules is just one of the codes that predates association football and which shared some common rules with it.  We have to also understand that the FA rules of the early 1860s represent a completely different game to that which was to emerge the following decade.  Far more handling of the ball was allowed, and this was eventually reduced to just the goal keeper.

Here's some passages from ''Football in Sheffield''.

:"From the latter [Sheffield Rules] certain details which were subsequently adoped in the national code may be noted. There should, stated Sheffield, be a crossbar; a player of a defending side need not stand behind his goal-line in the event of a free kick being taken within six yards of the goal-line; a goal could not be scored direct from a free kick (the origin of the 'indirect free kick'); and umpires should be appointed to 'enforce the rules'."

:"On Febuary 28 this proposal was accepted, and the corner kick, devised by the Sheffield Association, became a feature of the general game."

:"The impracticability of the situation was by now apparent to the most conservative, particularly since Sheffield took part in the F.A. Cup Competition and was represented internationly, and in April 1877 after the publication of powerful letters from Stuart G. Smith (captain, Manchester Association F.C.) and W. S. Bambride (Marlborough College) in The Field (March 10) final submission was made. One set of laws, that promulagated by the Football Association, was at last accepted. However, the Sheffield Association had the satisfaction of knowing that finality was only acieved after the incorporation of ideas from Sheffield."

I haven't any reliable sources yet but it also seems that Sheffield Rules were also played by a number of teams outside south Yorkshire, which is why having the two codes became such a major issue. The article currently seriously underplays the influence of the Sheffield Rules. [[User:joshurtree|josh]] ([[User talk:joshurtree|talk]]) 13:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

:::The part you quote refers to the final agreement between the two associations. The overall impact of the Sheffield Rules was much more significant.

This, like many books on the history of football, completely ignores the influence of the Sheffield version of the game. To say that the two codes merged doesn't deny the fact that there were other influences. The Thring/Cambridge Rules are given an entire section, while the Sheffield Rules are passed off with a short paragraph with no comment on their significance.

I have a doubt .i know this must be discussed numerous number of times over here .But since when has football (for the non American users) has ever been referred to as 'Association football'?According to the article , one is bound to think that if somebody goes to England and decides to see an Arsenal game , he will be watching an Association football game?

Come on guys , be less biased .i know there will be a lot of American users overe here in wikipedia which is why we see such an inherent bias in the article .But lets be realistic .You go to any part of the world and say you want to play football , it means only one kind of football and thats the one which had its world cup in Germany recently .

i would recommend a page like this for the article on football .

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket

Especially this part 
'For the insect, see Cricket (insect). For other uses, see Cricket (disambiguation)'

Change that sentence to 
'For the American version, see football (America). For other meanings, see football (disambiguation)'

And talk about football/soccer for the rest of the article .

:First, you are quite wrong to say that "You go to any part of the world and say you want to play football, it means only one kind of football and thats the one which had its world cup in Germany recently." Read the first paragaraph. It says: "The English language word football is also applied to Rugby football (Rugby union and Rugby league), North American football (American and Canadian), Australian rules football, and Gaelic football". There are also the many different varieties of older football games which preceded the modern football games, as described in the article.
:Second, [[cricket]] (the game) and [[cricket (insect)]] are not related to each other by anything except the word. The subjects covered in this article ("Football") are all related. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 03:27, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

::Even in the UK the term 'soccer' or 'Association football' is used by some.

'Association football' is the correct official name for the sport, it is not much used except in formal publications such as encyclopaedias (which this just happens to be). Again 'soccer' is not an American term, it is a term that comes from England and it is not used only by Americans (the Irish, the Candians, the Aussies etc refer to their own sports as 'football').[[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 12:08, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

Firstly where did you all get the idea that Association football is the correct official name for the sport .It might be the official name for that sport in America just like how in the rest of the world , the official name for the kind of football played in America is American football .

But obviously  rest of the world is a bigger domain than America - so the general consensus should be what most people in the world feel .

Secondly people do refer to football as soccer in UK - no one is denying that .But if people say that they are going to watch a football match , it obviously means a soccer match - not a rugby match .

Just because a very small minority in the world feels football refers to some other sport- why should we insult the beautiful game by not devoting the page on football to football as the world knows it?

Majority of the world refers to Osama Bin Laden as a terrorist .But there are still many people in the world who refers to Osama as a freedom fighter .So does that mean we say Osama Bin Laden is a freedom fighter? No.

When you have 6 billion people in the world and more than 5 billion refer to football as the FIFA version which is a very very large majority (the fact that FIFa has more members than the UN and the fact that FIFA has the word football in it should justify that fact) , then shouldnt the general consensus swerve towards the majority .

:::Not many people, even in countries where soccer is king, realise that FIFA stands for ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' or "International Federation of Association Football" &mdash; in French the noun and the adjective are reversed &mdash; so, even FIFA refers to soccer as Association Football, to distinuish it from other forms of football.

Who, in the progressive, rich, prosperous, enlightened and most intelligent, English speaking countries refers to soccer as football apart from the brainwashed and easily manipulated English and Scottish peasants? who having been oppressed by the class system for a hundred generations, mimick the absurd mutations of football and its playing, created by the FA lords and private school boys in 1863.

We, in the free nations of [[Australia]], [[U.S.A.]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]], with real football, know what football is. Why should we allow this absurd English cultural imperialism to be forced onto us by a minority with no concept about football and possession?

If anything, in line with the majority of the world's Anglo-Celts who invented football, we should demand that soccer(that poofter's game) should be removed entirely from the football section, as only an insignificant rump of Anglo-Celtics would even consider that game lacking any real concept of possession or courage as football. Unlike Rugby or Australian Rules or American football or Gaelic football which the majority of Anglo-Celt English speakers could easily understand upon watching as a type of football, that aberration that can only be described as "Volley-kick-ball", a perversion of football to reinforce the class system.

== Scottish passing and running/combination game ==

I notice that this style of football is not mentioned in the history section on football: (from [[Football in Scotland]])

There was a distinct clash of styles in 1872 when Scotland drew 0-0 with England in the world's first football international. England played a 1-1-8 formation, in which whoever had the ball would dribble at the opponents and kick it up field before he was tackled. One of the seven forwards, following behind, would then chase the ball.

Scotland played with a 2-2-6 system, with three banks of forwards divided into pairs. Each pair of players - in defence, midfield and attack - knew who their partner was and their job was to pass to them when possible. This revolutionary tactic of 'passing and running' was known as the combination game

The rules of football in England were decided in the public schools where individualism was an important factor. In Scotland, it was a societal thing. There was no class bias in football and everyone grew up playing the game in the streets. Queen's Park were made up of 13 young men from between Aberdeen and Inverness who came to Glasgow to get white-collar work in banks and commerce. They formalised the team in July 1867, a time when Clydeside was producing one quarter of the world's ships and railways.

After the game, English players returned home to tell of Scotland's combination game. Soon hundreds of Scots - known as 'Scotch Professors' - were playing in England. Preston North End fielded eight Scots in one team while Liverpool were founded in 1892 with eleven Scots.

I'd like to add this somewhere as it seems like it was a fairly important development in the sport. Does anyone have any suggestions where it should go in the article? I would also like to see some references which are sorly missing. -- [[User:OoberMick|OoberMick]] 12:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

==Football inter-wiki==
I was wondering if there had ever been any previous problems with inter-wikis, as [[Football]] on the English wiki is a page which focuses on a number of varieties, whereas a lot of other wikis would just have ''Football'' as purely soccer article, so has there ever been a mix-up between where the interwikis should goto? I'm just asking because I believe there is a problem like this at [[rugby football]]...in a lot of places around the world, ''rugby'' means [[rugby union]]. This is a problem because there are currently only 8 other wikis at ''rugby union'', but well over 20 at ''rugby football''. This cannot be right, as the [[Rugby World Cup|Rugby (union) World Cup]] has double the amount ''rugby union'' has. I have checked a few out, and some of them are actually about ''rugby union'' not ''rugby football'', but some do mention [[rugby league]] and [[rugby sevens]] at the bottom or something...so to get to the point, has there ever been any similar problems...and yeah. I may not have been totally clear as to what Iam saying, but I have posted this in other places, and no one really said anything, so if anyone knows how to deal with this kind of thing, any comments would be greatly appreciated. Cheers. [[User:Cvene64|Cvene64]] 15:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

The Number of football games played globally, from all traditions, and at all levels through the course of history, must be in the hundreds of thousands. The NFL alone is a twenty billion dollar industry giving the US a twenty-something week season chock full of games. As is mentioned above, the NFL does not remotely scratch the total expression involved in "football". The effort, the enthusiasm, the team identification, the bravado rallys forth from weekend to weekend, with games pitted at every level of expertise and age, entire populaces expending enormous amounts on amusements, decor, costumes and food planning for, practicing for and participating in  these forays.  When you get to the bottom of it though, virtually only a handful of these games, and perhaps that is being liberal, have had any real significance in the history of humankind. It is interesting.  You would think with all the stat mills churning out fantasy football picks this would be easy, finding that number. Not so. Not even the NCAA seems to want to openly report the number of Division 1 games played in 2005 in any forum I could find.  Why is that. Do they not want you to think about these things?
I have spent about four to five hours googling now, trying to find out just what that number is, the total number of football games that have came and went, with all the libation and sweat, and struggle, winners and losers, their meaning lost to the statisical books, and now computers, which will all eventually crumble into entropic bits and pass like all the other quarks into the continuum. And then what shall it all have meant? All that horseness, yelling at the top of one's lungs, Run, Damn it, run!

== Argument ==

I will put the argument here. Why is a clearer and better headlining so offensive?

To present Rules as an Australian and Irish variety is misleading and avoidable, so what is the point of continuing this?

There was no offense to it when it was put up, so why wait for two months to change it?

There seems no less point to putting Rules under a rugby school headline than putting rugby football and American football under a rugby school headline, as the deviant point for American football and rugby football is after the publishment of the RFU rules in 1870 which were different from rugby school rules.

Why continue the obtuse and wrong argument?

:::Hi Grant - I accept that it is a convenient grouping, justifiable by both the rules of the respective games and the modern day link.  But I seriously doubt there is a strong historical link.  You're right that I am influenced by Blainey's book  - but the arguments he puts forward stack up quite well in my mind.  Ultimately, the clincher for me is that going back to 1858, it was English public school types that were putting together our code - I really doubt that the Irish would have had much of a look in, or at least, knowledge of any pre-existing Irish game would have had no more greater influence than the knowledge they had of Rugby school rules, Cambridge rules, etc. (certainly no disrespect intended to the Irish game either, which I think is a great game) [[User:Pippu d'angelo|πίππύ δ'Ω∑]] - [[:scn:User talk:Pippu d'Angelo|<small>(waarom? jus'b'coz!)</small>]] 04:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
::::One may state without much contention, if done from honest analysis, that aussie rules is in fact a variation of soccer's forerunner [[Cambridge Rules]]. Following rules and variations, such as playing on an oval field, not kicking off(which both soccer hd and rugby still has), the "loser's reward" posts were introduced in Australia. The sheer amount of evidence for this is overwhelming, when considered that most of the original writers were in fact attendants of the cambridge college and the rugby school. Gaelic, on the other hand, seems more a rejection of soccer and rugby. Irish immigrants in Sydney, New York and Manchester all took up rugby with gusto, so there is perhaps more relationship between traditional Irish [[caid]] and rugby, though there is no proof or logic to asserting any realistic direct Irish influence on the fundamentals of the Melbourne game, perhaps there is through the webb ellis myth.

:::::Always glad to hear a considered opinion, thanks. I think it's easy for us to forget that &mdash; as late as the 1870s &mdash; there were scores of different kinds of football. The Cambridge Rules certainly were an important influence. In fact, Australian rules did have kicking off until (if memory serves me correct) the 1880s. Possibly the strongest proponent of the view that Irish games did not influence Tom Wills and other progenitors of the Melbourne game is the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]]. However, I had another look at Blainey's book ''[[A Game of Our Own]]'' today and his coat is slung on a rather more slender logical hook than many of his admirers may imagine: first, he states that those involved in the match/meeting organised by Wills on July 31, 1858 played a variety of football codes. Second, his argument rests on the fact that few Irish Catholics played Australian rules before the 1880s; indeed Blainey states that they preferrred to play [[hurling]] and regarded the new code as a "Protestant game". The irony is, that in doing so he affirms that hurling, an Irish sport with no offside rule (like Australian rules and the later Gaelic football) was reasonably widespread in Victoria at an early stage. And if hurling was there, why not caid? Also, it is neither here nor there whether Irish people played Australian rules &mdash; Tom Wills & co had only to witness hurling, caid or whatever to be influenced by them. Finally &mdash; and I was surprised to notice this for the first time &mdash; Blainey provides no references or bibliography in his book!

==Proper cites required==
Kicking games at Caunton, Nottinghamshire were described by a 15th century English monk: "the players propel a huge ball, not by thowing it up into the air, but by striking and rolling it along the ground, and not by their hands but by their feet." This is particularly noteworthy as it is the earliest description of an exclusively kicking ball sport and for being described as a "game". The game, however, was rough, as shown by the monk's description: "a game, I say, abominable enough . . . and rarely ending but with some loss, accident, or disadvantage of the players themselves." cites - http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/sherwoodtimes/football.htm - I don't think this is sufficient.

==additional info needed==

I think that the evidence for the first reference to football in ireland is too weak.  It needs to be cited properly and if it is in a foreign language we need to know what its literal translation is.

Under the FA section I think it should state that this is the first organised soccer organisation in the world and I do think that it needs to say that for this reason it does not have English in front of it.  Otherwise it sounds like some kind of international forerunner to FIFA and anyone who does not follow soccer might think that it died out or was replaced...   Jeb
:The FA don't have 'English' in their title because they were not set up to be the governing body for football in England.

==Page structure and order==

I would like to propose that the order be changed.  It seems to me that it is natural for the section on Australian rules to come straight after the section on the Football Association and the one on rugby football.  This is not because I think soccer is more important... it is just more logical that the split that occurred at the formation of the  Football Association and rugby football should follow the info about the Cambridge rules.  It is one evolutionary process:  public schools.. cambridge rules... fA formation ... others went off to form rugby clubs.  This sequence should be kept together and not be broken up by the section on aussie rules.

Nothing personal to the aussies!

Also I think the section on the FA should be entitled: Association Football and the Football Association

thanks

Rick

:I don't agree, on several levels. Even if the the evolution did occur as you suggest, this only looks at the English history. The current order is chronological, and expresses the fact that while rugby football and other rules were used in public schools, rules such as the Cambridge, Sheffield and Melbourne rules were also being developed. The attempts to unify the British codes resulting in the FA and it's rules come after the Australian rules, even though they weren't influenced by the Australian rules. The "others" remained rugby-style clubs, rather than went off, and then the RFU was formed. If we were to take a more thematic approach, the further development of the American codes, the rugby codes and global soccer would not be interspersed with each other, either. I think the thematic approach is better left to articles like [[History of football (soccer)]]. Your suggested header title seems repetitive. Perhaps it would be better to rename the Rugby football section to The Rugby Footall Union. [[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 13:16, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

:::ok guys, points taken.  I think that at the end of the public schools section it should be made clearer that the codes developed at these schools were influential in the formation of the rules that the FA adopted.  As it stands at present, it looks as if public school football all ended up as rugby football.  The influence of these codes on the FA rules (via committee members who had been at these schools) should be recognized.

== Popularity and globalisation ==

Could something more be said about the remarkable popularity and global appeal of football games, in particular soccer? The article currently doesn't account for the following distinctive features of football:

1) As a proportion of the world's population, the viewing figures for the (soccer) World Cup Final are staggering, dwarfing any other sporting event - Where does this global appeal come from? What features of the game generate such massive spectator interest, even in countries such as Japan and Thailand where there is little or no history of professional football?

2) Throughout Europe and South America, interest in soccer is far greater than for any other sport, including other types of football - Why is this?

3) In most English-speaking parts of the world, if soccer isn't the dominant sport then another code of football is either top or in the top tier of culturally important sports - Why is this? Does it provide a visual spectacle that other team sports don't perhaps?

4) Why are sports of British origin such as cricket and non-soccer football games so popular in former British colonies at the relative expense of soccer, whereas throughout the rest of the world soccer has been a far more successful export? Did other games arrive first and crowd out soccer?

Also,

<blockquote>
'''Early history'''<br />

Throughout the history of mankind, the urge to kick at stones and other such objects is thought to have led to many early activities involving kicking and/or running with a ball. Football-like games predate recorded history in all parts of the world, and thus the earliest forms of football are not known.
</blockquote>

should be deleted - it's not only unsourced, but also (by definition) entirely speculative.

--[[User:Will129|Will129]] 13:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC) Will129

1) and 2) should be in the Soccer article not here
3) speculative and point of view
4) arrived first, the discussion of whether cricket is popular at the expense of soccer in India etc is quite out of the scope of this article.[[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 13:57, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
:I think Gordy's right. FWIW I think point 4 is the key to the others. When soccer, cricket and rugby were invented in the late 19th century, the [[British Empire]] was the leading economic, military and cultural power. [[Victorian era|Victorian Britain]] was also a culture which highly valued recreation and physical exercise. It's a little like the spread of American movies and music in the 20th century. Soccer had practical appeal in that it could be played in a few hours (unlike cricket) and did not usually result in severe injuries (unlike rugby, especially the early forms). The injury issue was a big thing as most sports were strictly amateur or poorly paid and players could not afford to take time off work. India was an old British colony and the first recorded cricket game there was in 1721, which probably gave it head start of 150 years on soccer. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 19:35, 9 December 2006 (UTC)
::Victorian Britain valued sport more than other cultures because back then Britain was sufficiently developed that even working class people had leisure time whereas Poles, Italians, Mexicans etc did not.
::Cricket is well adapted to the climate of India (ironically England has one of the least cricket-friendly climates), but soccer and rugby are not.[[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 21:06, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

Soccer is very popular in a lot of former British colonies, especially those in Africa.These were the countries colonized after the invention of association football in 1863.
:Those colonies didn't receieve a lot of British settlers. Most Ghanians probably never saw a Briton. It is not surprising that they didn't adopt the British sports of cricket and rugby union. Rugby union was invented after soccer so its popularity in NZ etc has nothing to do with the date of colonization.[[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 14:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
::FWIW, there were a lot of European settlers in southern and east Africa but those countries are at least as famous for rugby as soccer. Also, Rugby was invented before soccer, since it was codified at Rugby School in 1845. From memory there were already something like 75 rugby clubs in Britain ''when'' the RFU was founded in 1870, not to mention some in other countries.

== Hybrid Codes ==

As far as I knew, [[International rules football]] was a hybrid code, just like [[Austus]] and [[Universal football]].  What makes it belong in the Irish and Australian varieties of football.  it has been around for less than 50 years and has no leagues or clubs of any substance.  --[[User:Spewmaster|Spewmaster]] 01:58, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
: It belongs there because it is a hybrid of Gaelic and Aussie rules, which are the main games in that "family". The reason why it has no clubs or leagues it that it exists only for games between the two codes. Its significance is had to dispute when you consider that this year it set a crowd record for international sport in Ireland, with 82,127 people at [[Croke Park]]. [[User:Grant65|Grant65]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 03:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

::That appears to be a lot of people.  Is there a way of objectively analyzing a sport's contribution to the economy by measuring ticket sales?

Would it be fair to say that that sum was matched by businesses on the periphery, such as hotels and motels, snackfood vendors and the like?  In short, perhaps $1,000,000 US dollars?

Would anyone object to the "Other developments in the 1850s" being replaced with a section on the rise of club football. I suggest this because it has become a poor section where general facts about the decade seem to collect. Meanwhile the rise of club and inter-club football is completly ignored. It was clubs which subsequently pushed for common codes, created the FA and gave rise to paying spectators and ultimatly professionalism.

==soccer versus Association Football==

I've changed 'soccer' to 'Association football' in quite a few places. Association football is the official name of the sport whereas soccer is just a name some people use.

:It's beside the point whether Americans would like gridiron as a heading; the fact is, a lot of people, both those who know the game simply as "football" and those who know the game simply as "soccer", have never heard of "Association football". Soccer is both the official name and the common name in the USA and Canada, and many people in those and other countries would be bemused to be told that the word is "slang " or somesuch.

What nonsense are some of you speaking on here? seriously? soccer is NOT football. The sport is founded and created as FOOTBALL. soccer is what the americans and canadians call it in ignorance. you notice all the FOOTBALL clubs all have FC in their names? Manchester United FC,FC Internazionale,Real Madrid CF etc.

Also note that FIFA contains no 's'.Recently a very stupid person has told me the F in FIFA stands for federation. Very good sunshine what do you think the other F stands for? FOOTBALL
FIFA is the world governing body and they never use the s word. Look at Europe as well. UEFA not UESA. Infact all the other federations in the world use football barring 2.

It really doesn't matter if an Englishman came up with the word 'soccer' he didn't invent the sport and thus he cannot change the name of it. Worse yet no one in England or the UK uses it anyway. So please do not tell me any rubbish about 'soccer' is football. If you are an american or canadian frolicking in the ignorance and calling it soccer then that is very sad but the sport is called football.

No one calls hockey,curling,basketball or any of those lesser sports any other name. So show respect to the world's greatest sport and call it by its ONLY and PROPER name of FOOTBALL.

::Mr van Nistelrooy - if I'm not mistaken, FIFA is an acronym of a French name, and this is actually the English wikipedia.  Now even if Canadians and Americans are as ignorant as you claim, the mere fact that they continue to use the term soccer is quite relevant because of the sway they have in the English speaking world, remembering that this is an English language wikipedia.  Gordy is correct that that the official name of the sport in England was always Association Football.  Finally, I give you this quote from the Macquarie dictionary (Australian usage):
::football
   /'footbawl/.
   noun
       1. any game in which the kicking of a ball has a large part, as Australian Rules, Rugby Union, Rugby League,
   soccer, American football, etc.
       2. Chiefly WA, SA, Victoria and Tasmania Australian Rules football.
       3. Qld, NSW
             a. Rugby League.
             b. either Rugby League or Rugby Union.
       4. Chiefly British soccer.
       5. the ball used in any of these games.
       6. Colloquial an amphetamine pill.
   Also, Colloquial, footy.
   Usage: While it is still the case that in general use soccer is the preferred term in Australia for what most of
 the   world calls football, the fact that the peak body in Australia has officially adopted the term football for 
 this   sport will undoubtedly cause a shift in usage.

vNistelrooy9, as the "very stupid person" who pointed out to you that the first F of FIFA stands for federation, I would like to remind you that I only did this because you said "it's not sifa". Since you were so keen to call North Americans ignorant, I thought you should bother to get it right yourself. I also pointed out to you that FIFA is in French, and so not relevant to the English language, but you seem to have ignored that. Do you think we shoudl call swimming "natation" becaus there is no S in [[FINA]]?

The fact is that many English speakers in different parts of the world don't jsut call it "football". If you read the article, you will learn that association football was ''never'' the only game that used the name football. That means that other names need to be used. Association football is the most formal name, soccer is another. It is not "incorrect", it is simply another name. While many people may be ignorant, the name "soccer" is used even by those who seem to know more than you, and in some places is not the slang word it is in England (where I have seen it in newspaper headlines), but used in official names.

Finally, please stop and look at what you are doing to the article. You are not only removing uses of "soccer" in the text and replacing it with the ambiguous "football" rather than "association football" which would be a reasonable change, you are also blindly undoing other people's improvements to the article which have nothign to do with this issue, and worst of all, removing "soccer" from link targets that don't even show up in the text, meaning that links are broken, wrecking the article.

:yea yea yea you fucking dunce. since the first F in FIFA doesnt stand for football what does the second one stand for? you fucking ignorant pig shit. and dont try that bullshit about the word 'soccer' came from England. so what? do they or anyone else bar the ignorant canada and us use it? NO. so shut the fuck up and don't bring that horse shit arguement to me. the sport is FOOTBALL so take your rinky dink arguements and shove it you cunt. Whether association football or football its still NOT soccer so please do not bring that garbage to me or to anyone else. 
whoever brought up the HULL AFC great its still not soccer and that word is still not acceptable. Football International Federation Association bitch. the word 'soccer' is not used by intelligent people to describe the sport but clearly some of you here are not.

You haven't yet given one reason why "that word is not acceptable", even though others have managed to give a reasonable argument. Saying that intelligent people don't use it just displays your own ignorance, as does the fact that you haven't discussed this in a civil way, and still haven't learnt how to make your changes to the article without destroying it.

::: I'm an Aussie soccer fan. Virtually all Aussies (outside of soccer administrators, some journalists and Euro expats) call it soccer. The same goes for New Zealand. South Africans usually call it soccer, but also call it football. Ireland is split between people calling soccer "football" and those that call Gaelic football "football". It is almost certain that a majority of people who speak English as a first language say "soccer", especially since there are 300 million people in the USA, as opposed to 60 million in the UK.

Most of the 'pommies' I know (probably rather more than you) are actually very intelligent, friendly, non-ignorant people, as I'm sure you are too. As an Englishman living in England reading the English press etc etc, I can see why he is vehemently (though not coherently) arguing for the term football to be applied exclusively to what I shall call, for clarity's sake, soccer. After all, 'Football' is the term that we English see applied to soccer 99.9% of the time, and being the patriotic lot (who like to believe we invented it, despite being unable to prove it), we don't like it when someone else tells us we're playing something called soccer. And yes, 'soccer' does get used ''occasionally'' in England, even in citeable sources, but it's few and far between. Now, I'm only trying to explain his apparently irrational argument, I personally think Wikipedia's handling of the confusion is quite good, seeing as how globally there are so many variations of the ball-to-foot game which all get called 'football' locally.

==Wedderburn ==

I have added the original latin and the original english translation of the whole Wedderburn quotation to the page on British public schools. I have altered the sentence on the main football page because the original latin states "strike it here" (huc percute) and "strike again" (repercute). That is to say that the word "pass" is not used explicitly. (one might want the ball to be hit here for other reasons than the modern concept of passing the ball during play). It should also be noted that Carew's account of Cornish Hurling categorically described passing the ball from player to player (dealing) and this predates Wedderburn.

The 1602 Carew quote also refers to goalkeeping, which again predates Wedderburn.

== Gaelic Football ==
Sections 2.2.10 and 3.1 ought to be ammended. Firstly, Ireland ought to be included in those countries listed whereby football (often) refers to another sport other than Association Football (Soccer). In rural areas, the term ''Football'' soley refers to Gaelic Football and the Irish media use a convention whereby Association Football is referred to as 'Soccer' and Gaelic Football as just that.

The origins of Gaelic Football predate the 19th Century as the post implies. This addition ought to be made:

The first mention of football in [[Ireland]] is found in 1308, where John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at Newcastle, [[County Dublin]] was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.

The Statute of Galway of 1527 allowed the playing of "foot balle" and [[archery]] but banned "'hokie' [sic] &mdash; the [[hurling]] of a little ball with sticks or staves" as well as other sports. However even "foot-ball" was banned by the severe ''Sunday Observance Act'' of 1695, which imposed a fine of one [[shilling]] (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports. It proved difficult, if not impossible for the authorities to enforce the Act and the earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]], at [[Slane]], in 1712.

The first references to the nature of play was in 1670: the ball may be held and struck either hand or foot. Often referred to as ''peil'' (see modern ''Peil Gaelach'').

Football was thought to have been introduced into Ireland by the Normans in the 12-13th centuries and was predominantly played in the south and east of the country. There were no references to Football in the Brehon Laws (''Fénechas'').

''Caid'' refers not to a specific code of football but the equipment used i.e. the ball. The '''Field Game''' as it was played in Kerry was the principal basis for that code of football played by the Limerick club, Commercials, upon which Maurice Davin is thought to have drawn inspiration. It was a pitch-based, field game composed of two opposing teams that took turns defending a 'goal', which comprised the boughs of two stripped trees tied to one another in the characteristic 'H'. Different scores were indicated depending upon whether the ball was driven above or below the bar.

Gaelic Football is similar to Australian-Rules Football, although their common origin is disputed. What is not in dispute, however, is that the Irish of Victoria played football (noted in 1843). Also, most Irish convicts at that time were either Rebels (or their descendents) from the 1798 Rebellion and thus predominantly from the south-east of Ireland.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Martan32|Martan32]] ([[User talk:Martan32|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martan32|contribs]]) 13:17, 22 February 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

"football" is used in english-speaking countries to refer to a sport.  The greater percentage of that population lives in the USA or Canada - where "football" means the contact sport involving two teams of 11 players each.  Thus, because this is in the English Wikipedia, this page should explain that sport - not soccer.  Failing that, a disambiguation page should be used.

Sorry if I'm doing this wrong but I've never posted on Wikipedia before. I just wanted to say that the scope of this article is perfect for the word "football" and there shouldn't need to be a disambiguation page. I am from the US and have a sister who plays "soccer" and I looked up this page originally because I wanted to know why there is a single word that refers to completely different sports in different countries. This page not only describes each sport, it also gives a link to each particular take on the sport, and describes the history of each set of rules, far beyond what I had actually expected to see here. If I had just come across a disambiguation page, I would never have seen the rich history about how a simple concept (foot+ball) became such a complex family of games. And furthermore, anyone who declares that the word means only one thing, for any reason, is showing the kind of attitude that detracts from the free global share of information and the crossing of culture borders that I expect from Wikipedia.

:::Both arguments are quite strong. However:

:::While it is possible that there are more speakers of British English (and other forms that prefer "football = soccer"), this would only be the case if we were counting non-native speakers. And while I'm all in favour of the English Wikipedia being useful to non-native speakers, there is no logical reason why they should decide the location of articles ahead of native speakers. I mean even if I spoke/wrote fluent French or Japanese, I would still be hesitant to suggest how the French or Japanese Wikipedias could be better organised.

No, No, NO!!! I am a non-native English speaker from the EU and I believe that I have the right, no! I DEMAND to have the exact same rights around here as any native English speaker. I did pass a Cambridge CEA Exam with A, so I belive I am entitled to the same basic rights in the English Wikipedia as any native speaker of English. Besides, I could probably state that I know more about English grammar, at least in a formalised way, than many native speakers in the U.S. Not to mention the fact that a greater percent of the population of say Netherlands know English at an intermediate or higher level than the percent that do in the U.S. (which, I will admit, is due to immigration patterns in the U.S.). Anyway, to sum it up, yankee boy, I took your comments as a personal insult, an ad personam argument and a direct attack to my rights around here. And I could bet there are SCORES AND SCORES of people who felt exactly the same. Believe me you won't be able to classify us as second class netizens around here. We won't go quietly, no matter how experienced you are in this sort of things after what you did to the Asian Americans and the Black Americans... and the Latin Americans. Besides, this page is like a bigger disambiguation page, explaining the differences between different codes of football. It's not about the association football only. So, we have favoured diversity and presentation of all points of view. You are arguing for removal of all other points of view but yours. I believe that violates a couple of Wikipedia policies. And yes, I do have the balls to say this as a netizen of the English Wikipedia with the exact same rights as anybody else.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Omulurimaru|Omulurimaru]] ([[User talk:Omulurimaru|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Omulurimaru|contribs]]) 12:52, 24 May 2010 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:So let me get this right - you passed an exam based on the native-speaker model and this validates your view that native speakers have no particular ownership of the English language? That's rather an odd view.

:::As far as English speakers in the EU  are concerned, it is a myth that they overwhelmingly favour British usage. For instance, in German-speaking countries, soccer is ''füssball'' and "football" is used for American football. Similarly, if you Google for "soccer" on English language pages on .de, .fr, .it (etc) sites, you will get quite a few hits, because U.S. English is not uncommon in Europe.


::::I don't see how it REALLY matters. Seems like this whole discussion is not about names, but rather it's just a pretext for a fight between nationalities and sports. Everyone knows 'soccer' is the world's most popular sport, dwarfing American football by enormous numbers. The point about 'fussball' and 'football' is irrelevant: 'fussball' came first, then they needed a word for the american sport. It's true this is an English language encyclopedia, but it seems like it should be a factor that the majority of the world's languages' words for football are based on that word, rather than soccer. 
And, to the comment above, you chose the country that's most influenced by American culture in Western Europe, that enjoys basketball and is even very remotely interested in American sports.

As to whether or not Football should be called Football or Soccer, I think that it should be called the latter. Football was a name given to the sport long before soccer and as the Americans didn't even invent the sport I think that they should not be allowed to start naming it. The only logical reason as to why they call it soccer is because using football in their country would suggest 'American Football'. Well sorry but I'm not bloody American and I don't play/watch American Football so I'm going to continue to use Football. Europeans seem to share a similar frame of mind when choosing which name, German's (as mentioned above, somewhere.. ##!?) call it Fussball, literally translated as Foot ball.

:::I have to acknowledge how mistaken I was about what [[Rugby_Football_Union|rugby]] gets called and its very obvious that these uses of the word football will continue but that doesn't mean they are being represented correctly on this wiki page.</br> [[Acknowledging information correctly]] is next on order of importance as providing information at all which is a blindingly obvious importance on this talk page where every one has something to say about the name of football. That has to indicate some thing unclear. Leotolstoy suggests a vote and my opinion is that undisputed information can be made out without the dispute.</br> I am pointing out the absurdity (thanks to the Shudde for the word) of misleading description. You might not appreciate it.</br> The game of [[Gaelic Football]] closely follows a foot ball game being that the foot and the ball are required in the game play. The rules are to carry the ball but you must use your foot. It is basically a high contact, hand ball game but the foot is required by rules and is most commonly used to attempt scoring but the contact rules are ''much'' less permissive than other [[rugby style games]]. [[Aussie rules]] might be in between Gaelic and Rugby regarding contact rules(or at least they seem to be when they are playing Gaelic rules).</br> Who knows the [[rules of rugby]] and would finish a try with the ball on your foot? No you wouldn't know the rules then. Hand ball is not only permitted but the rule is hand on ball or no score. I didn't have to look it up. I learnt it. Foot is allowed and free kicks seem to be taken with the foot but aside of mobility, foot is not such an essential part of the game play otherwise. I don't know if you can score between the bars with out a free but that will be irrelevant for this. The other rugby style games also require foot in some large part but are primarily hand ball wrestling games. This is relevant in any description therfore should be acknowledged on this page (it is not and that lacks something [[fundamental]]).</br> The fact they display their inspiration from football in the sport names and even the name of the ball should not be misrepresented or discarded as it is like displaying their colours and those games are a big part of sport as we know it.</br> Football is, surprisingly, unique in this variety of football games that it uses the foot and the ball primarily with rules governing contact and obstruction. This is considered extremely distinctive and [[requires ackowledgement]]. Hands are allowed in football for goal keeping but this fits into the game without lessening the basis distinguishing the styles.</br> Football is the primary of these sports in popularity and history (look through [[Football|the page]] for instance) and so inspiring in this regard that hand based ball sports worldwide are most often named (regional) foot ball. Some exceptions including basketball (with the basket), baseball (bases), volleyball (volley the ball), cricket (er..ribbet), and handball itself. It is an indicator of fond the esteem of the football basis and should be treated as such and acknowledged boldly.</br>  Some refer to a game ''[[of]]'' football and some refer to a game ''[[with]]'' '''''[[a]]''''' football. Rugby style football games are based on a form of [[wrestling]]. It seems that until these sort of facts are acknowledged around this page people are going to dispute its contents. Wrestling with a football - it's as valid as any other style of game I can think of, wrestling, football, or anything bar racing. I can't imagine any lovers of these games being dissapointed with that description of them and the disputes here dont go much into wether or not football is football but rather wether rugby or such is football. That school of thought also has a place in acknowledgment on a correct and concise page (if not what is the point?).</br> The brief description 'These games involve:' does not acknowledge the contact style which distinguishes the games for any fan. ''That is'' absurd ''and'' incitful to provocation. Some people hear that obvious information is kept back and they fight and die hoping to correct it.</br> As for refering it as 'Association Football' it has to be acknowledged that these days that is old hat and it is and will be FIFA football (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) since a long time back and will be as far as anyone beleives so in this opinion. FIFA being represented only by a mention of 5 a side on this page only is not only ''[[piss poorly disappointing]]'' but it is ''[[misleading]]'' like the rugby relation. What about [[Masters Football]]? If these facts were made out correctly there would be less gripes on the page and it would be more apparent that soccer was a name to suit a non football area where football was not seen as the more common football sport. Grant should know that only the English can represent the vast majority of [[native]] English speakers and that the English language includes the word [[greeble]] picked out at random.</br> The issue of naming football as soccer only applies to informing people that football is the more widely accepted name. (or fus or fut or etc)</br> I am going to leave a quote from the [[FIFA]] page before considering minor interference in both pages regarding the language (just a little) and the lack of mention of FIFA (a very important addition not included) which would be much more suited to some moderator who is a good football boffin which I am not but it's nice to see the right links and the major stuff on the wiki pages.</br>And quote from the [[FIFA]] page:-</br> ""FIFA Anthem

:"Football is an ancient game. Some 2,500 years ago the Chinese played a form of it called Tsu chu, in which they kicked a ball of stuffed leather. Natives of Polynesia are known to have played a variation of the game with a ball made of bamboo fibres, while the Inuit had another form using a leather ball filled with moss. However, much of the game's development came about in England where it was first known in the 12th century. It became so popular that kings, including Edward II and Henry VI, tried to ban it on the grounds that it distracted men from the necessary military duty of regular archery practice. Such edicts had little effect.

Varieties developed in England and in Europe (in 14th-century Florence there was a form called calcio). A traditional version in England was known as Shrovetide football, common in the Midlands and the north of England for centuries. Such games might involve hundreds of men on each side and were usually a free-for-all between sections of a town, villages, or adjoining parishes that would often develop into a brawl. Many schools played football and some, notably Eton, Harrow, Winchester, and Rugby, evolved codes of their own, particularly Rugby, which established a code from which others (American football, for example) developed. During the 19th century there were concerted efforts to organize and structure the different forms and provide acceptable rules.

/br>"The Greek 'Episkyros' - of which few concrete details survive - was much livelier, as was the Roman 'Harpastum'. The latter was played out with a smaller ball by two teams on a rectangular field marked by boundary lines and a centre line. The objective was to get the ball over the opposition's boundary lines and as players passed it between themselves, trickery was the order of the day. The game remained popular for 700-800 years, but, although the Romans took it to Britain with them, the use of feet was so small as to scarcely be of consequence.

"Tlatchi was a game played by the Aztecs and some individuals have claimed that it is over 3000 years old. We cannot verify this but it is quite possible that the game was being played around 500 BCE. This would make it older than the Chinese game of Tsu Chu. However Tlachtli was more a mix of basketball, volleyball and football rather than just a forerunner of football. One key rule was that players could not use their hands, although they could use their heads, elbows, legs or hips(?).


The ruins of almost every ancient city include a walled court for the sacred game of Tlachtli. The courts were often close to temples, reinforcing the spiritual nature of the game. Tlatchi has been described as a spectator sport, an astrological study and a political engagement all at the same time. 

The sense of astrology comes from the fact that the Aztecs and particularly the priests felt that the movement of the rubber ball during the game symbolised the future path of the sun. 

Great prominence was given to the mystic similarities between ball and sun.Only the ruling elite were allowed to watch the game and gambling on the outcome of the game was very popular. Money, clothes and even slaves were bet on games.

Tlachtli was played in a sunken stone walled court surrounded by fans. The court was normally an 'I' or 'H' shape with one stone ring at each end of the court. (The stone rings were similar to basketball hoops and were 8-10 feet off the ground. The actual hole was less than 30 cm wide.
 

The actual game involved passing the ball from side to side without it touching the ground. If the ball fell to the ground on the other side your team would win a point and vice versa (similar to volleyball.) If you struck the ball with an incorrect part of your body you could lose points for your team.

However the real purpose of the game was to get the ball through the hoop at each end. The team that did this first won, irrespective of the current score of the game.

Players were given kneepads and helmets to protect them from the heavy rubber ball, although this was only a temporary measure as the losers of the game were sacrificed to the gods!

I agree with the first statement. Because this is the english wikipedia, football should be described as the sport where games consist of two teams on a football field. Each team has eleven players participating at once during the game. The point of the game is to score a touchdown, or to get the football into the endzone. that is the football America is known for, so that is what should be described on the page.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Rfilibert|Rfilibert]] ([[User talk:Rfilibert|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rfilibert|contribs]]) 21:55, 2 June 2010 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== They called it Flashball in 1974 but what do you call it? ==

So far as I can tell, the game they had us play in our physical education class in [[Clackamas High School]] in the [[North Clackamas School District]] in [[Oregon]] was called ''Flashball,'' and it doesn't seem to be discussed anywhere in Wiki, so I might as well pipe up here, and ask if anybody knows a game similar to it.

The game was superficially similar to American Football because of the use of the single [[prolate]] [[spheroid]] football, and the idea that points could be had, by taking it to the other side of the rectangular field, somehow, and getting it over the goal line. However, it permitted bouncing the ball, rolling the ball, passing the ball, smuggling the ball, and wrestling for the ball.  'Wrestling' means you had to punch or pry the ball out of the bearer's arms, sometimes with the assistance of a team member trying to twist the guy's arm away, to make him let go, and you only had up to the count of ten to do so.  Tackling and tripping was permitted.  It was a good idea to wear a helmet because it was a little rough.  You didn't have to be the guy carrying the ball to be in danger of being tackled, as anybody could tackle anybody, even members of your own team.  As for [[Rugby football|Rugby]], I don't exactly understand the terms [[ruck]] or [[maul]], so I will simply leave that term to others, so they can go back to those articles so they can describe those terms better.

For one thing, does Rugby or [[Gaelic Football]] have Referees who are supposed to count to ten (very loudly) when a battle for possession begins?  Flashball does.

To start the game, the opposing teams lined up on opposite ends of the field.  Then the Referee would walk out and into the middle of the field, and throw the football towards the team that had fewer team members (thus allowing uneven numbers of players to play against each other).  Anybody could snatch it up, and take off running with it, hopefully making it through the opposing team as they gathered to take him down.  More often than not, one or more opposing team members would take him down and attempt to ''bury'' the ball.  But he could pass or bounce the ball out of harm's way, such that his comrades could pick it up, and take off running with it.  The ball has to be buried till the count of ten, at which point the Referee declares which team was in "possession" of the ball.  It helps to have reversible [[T-shirt]]s because the Referee would say something like, "Blue has the Ball" or "Red has the Ball" depending on who had the ball more firmly immobilized.  If the ball rolls out of the mass of wrestling players, the Referee shouted "Ball in Motion."  If the ball comes to rest without any players in possession of it, then the Referee (after counting to ten) shouts out the name of the team most properly (that is, previously) in possession of the ball.

Aside from the initial throw of the ball by the Referee to the team that needed a break, the rest of the game was played by lining up the team members and hiking the ball, and then running it to the other side of the field.  You generally don't line up to "hike the ball" until the Referee blows on his whistle, after which, any players who are still wrestling in some other part of the field (not realizing that they were no longer in possession of the ball) are supposed to stop what they are doing, and come line up for the hike.

As I understand it, dropping the ball and kicking it over the goalie line doesn't count for any points.  You actually had to ''physically'' transport or carry the ball over the goal line for it to count.

If opposing players were to rush the ball before it was hiked, the Referee had authority to penalize that team, and make them backup 5 yards, and everybody had to line up again.  Unnecessary roughness (like punching somebody in the ribs, when you were simply trying to punch the ball out of somebody's arms) was another reason for a penalty.  (And similarly for "accidentally" spraining somebody's fingers when he won't let go of the ball, and two or three people are simultaneously trying to make him let go.  If you have that many people wrestling for the ball, any sane man will toss the ball before it comes to that.)

It was okay to tackle anybody you wanted, this being an interesting ploy for a more numerous team to employ against a less numerous team, inasmuch as two players could be taken down for the price of one.  Unlike Rugby, there was no duty to move away from the ball after tacking the bearer.  The game goes fast enough, that it isn't always immediately clear which player has the ball.  Having one Referee is mandatory, but having two Referees is even better.  As I seem to recall, eight touchdowns (carrying the ball physically over the goal line, and touching it to the ground) made a game.

No , FIFA stands for 'Fédération Internationale de Football Association' .If the Association actually came before the Football , it made some sense .But it doesnt - so the point of 'International Federation of Association Football ' is moot .

Coming to American football , only people in North america call it 'football ' .While I agree the official name of that sport is also football , the reality is that people outside of North America call it 'American Football ' to distinguish it from the more popular football .

In French it is also a compound noun but the order is reversed.

== Comment on intro attribution to England ==
I had a minor concern on the following statement at the end of the first paragraph.
:Many of the modern games have their origins in England, but many peoples around the world have played games which involved kicking and/or carrying a ball since ancient times.
I realize this statement is intended to be politically correct. Certainly it is true that England did not uniquely invent this type of sport and even England's inventions derive from sports originating in other places (this can be said of almost anything in any country). Nevertheless, my understanding is that everything in the world called "football" in English (and referred to by a phonetically similar word in other languages) came from England, at least indirectly. So it seems to me that this statement is unfairly politically correct, unless there is some aspect of the history that I am not aware of. Maybe the statement should be something like the following.
:Although, games involving kicking and/or carrying balls have existed in many cultures, all modern games known in English as "football" derive from games that originated in England.
Just my opinion ...
--[[User:Mcorazao|Mcorazao]] 03:06, 15 April 2007 (UTC)
:Not really. The subject of the article is all football games and there were many traditional/pre-modern games which fed into the present day codes, although the extent of their influence is controversial. [[User:Grant65|Grant]] | [[User talk:Grant65|Talk]] 04:57, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

I'm not sure I understand your argument. What do you mean by "all football games"? Do you mean "all games that involve feet and balls"? Or "all cames that anybody in the world has ever called football"? Or "all games that are recognized by some some official body as football"? With any term you can find ambiguity. I tend to believe that, for the encyclopedia to be coherent, it should stick with definitions that are widely used and widely accepted. That is not to say it should be limited only to the single most widely used definition, but it should neither try to include every conceivable definition ever used in the history of mankind (except perhaps to make small mention of some of the alternatives in a small section at the end of the article). I believe the term "football" is widely accepted as referring to the games of English derivation (including the North American game, of course). Although occassionally some similar sports in other cultures are called "football" in very localized circles I have never heard of such a game being widely associated with this term.

Anyway, probably not important enough to make such a big deal about. I am not English, by the way, if it is not obvious from the way I write. I was just trying to be culturally respectful.
--[[User:Mcorazao|Mcorazao]] 16:31, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

:Actually my dictionary's definition starts with "any game in which the kicking of a ball has a large part". The thing is that saying the games "originated in England" is a very strong statement about games whose earliest history and influences are both complicated and obscured by time. We have to ask did the English forms of football strictly originate in England, or were they derived from games imported from other parts of Europe, even before considering how any effect of [[Marn Grook]] on Australian football fits in with such a statement, and so on. [[User:JPD|JPD]] ([[User talk:JPD|talk]]) 16:59, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
:Mob football probably did not originate in England but nobody knows for sure. The article I think does deal with this. Other than Gaelic and Australian rules, it is quite clear that football games were codified in England or in the case of North American varients were derived from English games. Aussie rules may well have had an English origin (controversial) and at the very least we invented the pitch. There is some suggestion that Gaelic football incorporates English style rules as well.[[User:GordyB|GordyB]] 17:05, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

:::As to Ozzie Rules, I am pretty sure that upon comparing the first known rules of Melbourne Football Club Rules with its contemporaries in England, notably the 1863 association rules, Cambridge Rules, Rugby rules and Sheffield football club rules, as well as the acknowledgement that the writers of the rules attended the most prestigious English private schools, notably Cambridge college and Rugby school, any sane and rational person would conclude that at least 95% of the original game has its origins solely in England. That is not exactly controversial. As examples, the original goalposts were identical to the goalposts in Cambridge Rules and the original soccer rules, the pitch dimensions (that now to seem to individualise Ozzie Rules) were originally in the dimensions Cambridge Rules, running with the ball was like such in Rugby and the marks were a universal feature of all the football codes at that point in time. There have been a good many innovations since, but I think the establishment of the game was almost entirely and conclusively English. So I therefore think that football of all codes has a finite origin in England(except maybe Gaelic, but I am unconvinced about Gaelic being "caid"). --[[User:144.132.216.253|144.132.216.253]] 10:55, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

The NSWRU was forced to act because on this basis they would of lost all of their players as it was the first time that rugby league had the money to put the under threat. So within 2 weeks(from memory, maybe it was a little bit longer) of the super league war breaking out, the NSWRU declared that they were now professionals. Full time professionalism changed how rugby league was played as players were fitter and fitter and replacement rules were used in a more and more complex way.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/58.172.249.40|58.172.249.40]] ([[User talk:58.172.249.40|talk]]) 15:44, 14 December 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Reference to UK==

I was intrigued to see that the change from England to UK has passed unchallenged.  As far as the UK home countries go I do not think there is much evidence for football development in Wales or Ireland (later NI).  Certainly there is a long history of football in Scotland, but the origin of the modern codes was in England (Eton/Harrow/Winchester etc, Cambridge rules, Sheffield rules, football association).  Although there were significant scottish players, I believe that their contribution took place within England.

== Insulting ==

Hi, as an Australian I am insulted by the opening paragraph that makes a mention of soccer and actually has the gall to call it football but seemingly forgets to mention that only a few pommy bastards call soccer football and that in the English speaking worlds(discounting Indians and other non-Brittanics) the English are in a tiny minority in their reference to soccer being football which they are actually wrong about. I am not sure that soccer should even be on a page in English wikipedia dedicated to football and think that people should remove it. Afterall, outside of a few imperialists, everyone in Australia hates the d***heads that are trying to call soccer football, and even more importantly, the Americans dont do it either, leaving the English on their lonesome. I tried to change this but I cant for some reason so I would like someone who can to change it. Think about it, football means ball on foot in every English speaking society that is not bitched by the English culturally. In particular, [[rugby football]] and its varying splinters stand out as the clearest meaning of the term football. like [[rugby league football]], [[rugby union]], [[American football]], [[Canadian football]]. With gayfl, many of the original writers went to the rugby school and they were heavily influenced by the tour of the English football team to Australia in 1877, as well as them being undoubtedly influenced by the culturally superior and more densely populated states of NSW and QLD where rugby football is a religion. With Gaelic football, it was probably influenced by rugby football in the type of its posts. The only mention to soccer should be that it deviated from football in 1863 when it changed the emphasis of the game to kicking, and stopped being football when the average player was no longer allowed to catch the ball on foot and take a '''"mark"'''. I mean, look in a dictionary at the words that have the adjectival '''''foot-''''' as the beginning of the word and most of them only make sense when you add '''''by, with, in, on, from''''' before the foot, like '''''footmarch means a march on foot''''', or '''''footnote means a note on foot (of page)''''' whereas football could only mean soccer when you add the verb kick, as in ball kicked by foot/with foot, so it breaks the rule. In other cases like footstep meaning step FOR foot, it still does not give clarification for it meaning soccer ahead of rugby football, as ball for foot is ambiguous and is probably not the origin of the word, as the word was used for a sport originally and ball is not a sport. So that is why soccer should be kicked off the football page and I am insulted in the opening mention to it being the most popular form without giving the clarification that only the pommys call it football(and even than it has only become universal in the past 50 years, whereass before that clubs like Wigan FC definitely didnt play soccer and didnt compromise over the fact that they were a football club). So please change it somebody when they get the chance, and while we are at it, change the name of the soccer article. --[[User:Poo thrasher|Poo thrasher]] 10:20, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

Football, canadian football and aussie football are real sports and are called football by far more people than soccer is. i heavily suggest the british bias be taken out of this article.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/79.75.221.5|79.75.221.5]] ([[User talk:79.75.221.5|talk]]) 19:13, 13 July 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Get out of here. I'm Australian and I believe it should be called football. Hey it's actually played using the feet as opposed to others like Rugby League/Union/AFL <--That is their real name.

If you're Australian and you call it that you are part of a tiny minority.  Congratulations.  Oh and that tired old argument about soccer being played with the feet??? FFS name a code of football that isn't!  Oh sure, the other codes also allow you to play using the rest of your body.... JUST LIKE SOCCER DOES!  In soccer you can use your feet, shins, knees, legs, torso, chest, head and the goalie can use his arms and hands!  So by your logic soccer can't be called football either!

== Proposed splitting off of page ==

Ever since I found this page a long time ago, I've thought we should split it off. [[Football]] should be a disambiguation page, with the main 3 uses (rugby, gridiron, and soccer) at the top. The bulk of this text could go in [[football (history)]], and what's left of this page could become a disambiguation. This makes much more sense. 95% of people typing in football are looking for information on one of the specific sports, and if they're interested in reading about the pre-split history, they can click on that in the disambiguation page. [[User:The Evil Spartan|The Evil Spartan]] 00:03, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

:When you say "the 3 main uses" what about Australia where the "main use" would be Aussie Rules football which is just as valid as Association football, Rugby football (which is divided into two anyway, Rugby League & Rugby Union) and American football.[[User:Tangerines|<font color="darkorange">'''''♦Tangerines♦'''''</font>]]·<small>[[User_talk:Tangerines|Talk]]</small> 00:30, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

::::This has been discussed to death before. Most people who the page splitting up haven't actually read the article. There are dozens and possibly as many as a hundred different "football" games.

I don't think it is "confusing". On the contrary, I think the introduction is perfectly clear. As Gordy has suggested, this article began as a dab page, which became complicated to the point of confusion and uselessness.

== Conflicting Years ==

''In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games", showing that "football" — whatever its exact form in this case — was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

''King Henry IV of England gives the earliest documented use of the English word "football", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".[6][7]''''

That was taken from this article, but doesn't it seem to be contradictory? If Edward III issued a proclamation banning football in 1363 why is Henry IV's proclamation being referred to as the "earliest documented use of football" if it came more than 40 years later?

== Disambiguation ==

When people search for "Football" they are generally looking for a sport, be it [[Association football]], [[American football]], or anything else.  They are generally NOT looking for a broad historical analysis of the term.  So while I think this article has a lot of great information in it, I think it should start with a nice list of things colloquially called Football.  Like a disambiguation page.

== Comparison table ==
I find this Wikipedia entry is not about football itself, but about the *term* football.  It is a linguistic study about the term and what it comes to mean in time and space.  At any encyclopedia entry I expect to find the meaning, not merely the term.  The article is too history-related, it misses to describe actual football.  It is poorly designed too, it is difficult to find the variant of football you're searching for.  We get to know there are so much variants, but we don't get accurate descriptions from them... what the number of player is, whether there is or not a goalkeeper, the dimensions of the football ground, the number of referees...  Probably a comparison table would help. I think a photograph is strongly needed in order to illustrate every variant, and make it easier to find too. <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.33.246.185|83.33.246.185]] ([[User talk:83.33.246.185|talk]]) 18:56, April 20, 2008</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP -->

This is a much more inclusive and international article now, covering all the footballs that we know of here in the western world.

Internationally, we are tiny. But it's still most definitely 'football', and we are ferociously passionate about it in a way not replicated in other western societies (for historical and cultural reasons). I'm glad the 'American Football' article didn't get the monopoly of the title 'Football' here, even though it is probably what most speakers of English know as 'football', just as I am glad that 'Association Football' didn't keep it.

== Use of the word "football" in English-speaking countries ==

﻿Sorry for being naive, but I would have thought an online encyclopedia, like this would write factual articles and not one using somebody's personal opinions. I refer to the statement below:-

"However, in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, use of the word "football" by soccer bodies is a recent change and has been controversial."

Did the person who wrote this piece actually do any research? The New Zealand Football Association was formed in 1891 and continued to use this name until 1995, when they first changed to Soccer New Zealand, then to New Zealand Soccer. After eleven years they went back to football, and are now known as New Zealand Football. There was no controversy, the national league competition was already called the New Zealand Football Championship and as NZF's chief executive, Graham Seatter said:-

“It’s interesting that when the New Zealand Football Association went to Soccer New Zealand and then New Zealand Soccer that most clubs stayed as ‘football clubs’…… many people in New Zealand call it football so we need to acknowledge that.” 

As someone who comes from New Zealand and have lived all my life 'down under', I ask where was the controversy? There was none.

For many years, the governing body in Australia was known as the Australian Football Association, they too have simply gone back to using football. 

The two weekly Australian publications, 'Australian Football Weekly' and 'British Football Week' are publications that both deal with Association Football. Go to Australian website 'Fox Sports' (the official website of the tv channel of the same name), click on Football and you will get Association Football, not Rugby Union, not Rugby League, not Australian Rules
or any other game, but Association Football. 'SBS', another Australian television network, also use the name 'Football' for Association Football. 

Back here in New Zealand, go to the (New Zealand) 'Sky Sport' website (the official website of the tv channel), click on Football and again you will get Association Football, not Rugby Union, not Rugby League or any other game, but Association Football. Go to 'TVNZ Sport' website and click on Football and surprise surprise you again get Association Football. Still
not convinced? Pick up New Zealand Newspapers, 'Sunday News', 'Sunday Star Times', 'The Dominion Post' etc turn to the Football and what do you get? You guessed it, Association Football.

Most fans in both Australia and New Zealand prefer to call Association Football by the name of Football. In both countries it is the fans of the other codes that prefer to call Association Football by the name of Soccer.

Another statement used in the article:-

"The name "soccer" (or "soccer football") was originally a slang abbreviation of the word "association" from "association football" and is now the prevailing term in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand where other codes of football are dominant."

Actually, Association Football is the most played sport in New Zealand. 198,757 people play Association Football in New Zealand (source: FIFA), while only 136,059 people play Rugby Union (source: NZRU).

There are plenty in Ireland that call the game football. Organisations: 'Football Association of Ireland', 'Football League of Ireland' (now known as 'FAI League of Ireland'), 'Football Association of Irish Schools', 'Leinster Football Association', 'Munster Football Association' and clubs are called 'Football Clubs'. Media: there has been 'The Irish Football Handbook', 'Irish Football Online', Irish writer, Roddy Doyle refers to the game as Football, as does other Irish writers / journalists, Declan Lynch, Dermot Bolger, Roisin Ingle, Marie Jones etc etc. Also the comedy 'Father Ted' also called the game Football. 

Also in the United States, many ESPN commentators call the game Football. So to all those who think the UK is alone in being the only English speaking country that uses Football and not Soccer, think again. Also the former British West Indies countries and English speaking African countries also call Association Football, by the name of Football. [[User:Footballworldworldfootball|Footballworldworldfootball]] ([[User talk:Footballworldworldfootball|talk]]) 03:32, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

The only ESPN anchors that ever call soccer "football" are the guys who cover English football when they play it. Other than, "football" is used for American football by everyone else on the channel. I watch ESPN almost all day and I never once hear any anchors refer to it as such. --[[Special:Contributions/71.36.137.79|71.36.137.79]] ([[User talk:71.36.137.79|talk]]) 02:03, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

:According to [http://www.emigratenz.org/ReallyAndTruly.html this website], the numbers for soccer in NZ is less than netball. But to a certain degree the numbers need to include what is played at most schools in NZ (with a measure for the differentiation between primary and  secondary schools), and not just the numbers who play in clubs. --[[User:Philip Baird Shearer|PBS]] ([[User talk:Philip Baird Shearer|talk]]) 21:46, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I see that I have had a couple of replies to my comments. First in reply to 71.36.137.79, thank you for your comments, but you will see that I was referring to ESPN match commentators and NOT anchors. As I do not live in the States I have no idea what your anchormen call the game. However, I have watched British, European and South American matches from ESPN and the commentators refer to the game as football. Also many Amateur clubs in the States prefer FC (Football Club) rather than SC (Soccer Club). 

In reply to PBS, thanks for the link, however these figures are rather misleading. I will explain. The Football figure that is used on their website (105,000) is the one used by SPARC NZ back in 2002/03 and is for male footballers only (it also appears that it is only an estimate rather than an exact figure). However the rugby union figure (136,059) is the one used by the NZRU in 2007 and is for both sexes. According to FIFA, even back in 2000 New Zealand had 136,048 Association footballers (total for both sexes). The figure for Rugby Union players according to the NZRU in 2000-01 was 129,869. The latest figures from FIFA say that New Zealand now has 198,757 Association footballers while the IRB say that New Zealand now has 139,968 Rugby Union players. You will note that the gap between football and rugby has grown wider over the last nine years.[[User:Footballworldworldfootball2|Footballworldworldfootball2]] ([[User talk:Footballworldworldfootball2|talk]]) 22:21, 4 October 2009 (UTC)<small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Footballworldworldfootball2|Footballworldworldfootball2]] ([[User talk:Footballworldworldfootball2|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Footballworldworldfootball2|contribs]]) 03:24, 15 September 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

{{main|Oldest football clubs}}
During this period, the Rugby school rules appear to have spread at least as far, perhaps further, than the other schools' codes. For example, two clubs which claim to be the world's [[Oldest football club|first and/or oldest football club]], in the sense of a club which is not part of a school or university, are strongholds of rugby football: the [[Barnes R.F.C.|Barnes Club]], said to have been founded in 1839, and [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]], in 1843. Neither date nor the variety of football played is well-documented, but such claims nevertheless allude to the popularity of rugby before other modern codes emerged.

In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rugby chronology| work=Museum of Rugby | url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/index.cfm?fuseaction=faqs.chronology| dateformat=mdy | accessdate=April 24 2006 }}</ref>

== Disambig ==

I know this has been discussed before...
* [[Talk:Football/Archive 4#Name change]]
* [[Talk:Football/Archive 6#Split up the article]]
* [[Talk:Football/Archive 8#Can't this page just be a disambiguation?]]
* [[Talk:Football/Archive 9#Proposed move]]
* [[Talk:Football/Archive 11#This article's existence...]]
* [[#Proposed splitting off of page]]
* [[#Disambiguation]]
* [[#Disambiguation_2]]
* [[#Comparison table]]
* [[#Separation]]
...but I really think there needs to be a proper disambiguation page for "football". The main opposition arguments from previous discussion (apart from "this has been discussed before") seem to be the following:
* any disambiguation would eventually swell up to be as large as the current article.
* the current introduction already points anyone who's strayed here by mistake towards whichever article they intended to get to.
Now, it seems to me that you can't have it both ways. Either what need to be disambiguated is the small list of sports given in the opening paragraph; or else it's the huge list in the "Present day codes and families" section and subsections; but not both.  For my money, the small list is the necessary one. I've mocked up a disambiguation page at [[User:Jnestorius/Football]].  

With such a disambiguation page available, this current Football article could be moved and split into:
* [[History of football]]; made from [[Football#History]]
* [[List of football codes]]; made from [[Football#Present day codes and families]]. There is no need to add all of the list entries to the disambiguation page; [[WP:DPAGES]] says "Only add links to articles that could use essentially the ''same'' title as the disambiguated term." which doesn't apply to  [[beach soccer]], [[arena football]], [[futsal]], et al; while someone might refer to the game as "football" in a certain context where it's already obvious what game they're referring to, nobody could seriously consider "football" to be the name of the game.

There is an additional problem that can't be addressed with the current setup: mistargeted wikilinks. [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Football]], excluding redirects and transclusions, has over 3000 inlinks. My guess is that many of those really ought to point to [[association football]]/[[American football]]/etc rather than this page; but it would be quite tedious to check them all. OTOH, if "football" was a simple disambiguation page, then practically all WhatLinksHere would be misdirections, so it would be a minor housekeeping task to fix them as they arise. Currently, if an editor erroneously types <nowiki>[[football]]</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>[[association football|football]]</nowiki>, then unless it's picked up quickly it will be lost among the 3000 inlinks. 

There's some really good information on this page, and in a sense it would be a pity if readers bypassed it by being routed through a vanilla disambiguation page. However, it's not the place of editors to force readers to read something they're not looking for; instead, we must minimise the delay between searching for an article and finding it; I think the current structure is flawed. I don't know the details of querying Wikipedia's HTTP traffic, but it would be interesting to see how many readers get to [[football]] and immediately click out to [[American football]], say; and how long the delay is.

:I think this proposal makes a lot of sense. While this article is a good one, it does not belong at [[Football]]. From our readers' viewpoint: people typing "football" will, with very few exceptions, either be expecting an article on [[American football]], an article on [[Association football]] or a disambiguation page. The latter group will probably not care that this is not a standard disambiguation page; they find the links anyway. But the other groups will be confused for a short moment, and only ''then'' they will find the link to the article they're looking for (or even ''not'' find it, as this talk page shows is a real outcome for some people). And from an editor viewpoint, the incoming links thing really sold me. —<small>[[User:Jao|JAO]] • [[User talk:Jao|T]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jao|C]]</small> 18:08, 14 June 2009 (UTC)
::I think the current approach is fine. The reality is that these sports have similar roots, thus the historical approach. An extra page for [[football (disambiguation)]] might help readers. No reader is going to read this thinking it refers to a specific code (be it American or association football), the scope is obvious from the start. The fact that all official names of the sports carry the moniker of "X" football show that the current topic is the correct one. Think of [[guitar]] as a similar article: the types have varying styles and roots but the fact is they are all guitars (or guitar types), just as the listed sports are all types of football. Just as the history of the guitar discusses obsolete or ancient instruments, so does this article.

:::I don't think Sillyfolkboy or Kevin McE address the points I've raised. 
:::*Neither of you address the point about misdirected inlinks. 
:::*The fact that this article has "a historical approach" suggests [[history of football]] is an appropriate name. 
:::*If you agree a separate [[football (disambiguation)]] page is needed, then the question is merely which of the two pages should be at the default name and which elsewhere.
:::*Saying the article "deserves" to be at football reeks of the danger I mentioned of wanting to show off a nice article to people who are not looking for it.    
:::*Saying "No reader is going to read this thinking it refers to a specific code" is beside the point.  If the article [[Paris, Texas]] was at [[Paris]], it would be obvious from the start that it was an article about an American city and not about a French one; but it would still be incorrect. The issue is not what people understand once they have read the article; it's what the expect to find before they start reading it, which is certainly not a historical overview. If the article was moved to [[history of football]], then it would be just as obvious from the start what it was about: so what's the problem with moving it?
:::*The analogy with the [[guitar]] article is spurious, for two reasons. 
::::*The connect between different types of guitar is not merely historical origin, it is ongoing similarity. If you can play one type of guitar, you can play most types, and it's not unusual for people to play many different types. Have a look through the articles in [[:Category:Guitarists]] and see how many begin "N N is a guitarist ..." versus something like "N N is an electric twelve-string bass guitarist ..." Getting into what guitar(s) a person favours will be mentioned further on. Compare that with [[:Category:Footballers]] where the link will always be to the specific code the person plays, and if they play more than one each will be mentioned explicitly rather than using the umbrella term "football".
::::*Relatedly, there is a huge current commonality between all guitars. The [[guitar]] article has "history" and "types" sections analogous to those of the [[football]] article; but it also has further sections on construction and components, tuning, and accessories; i.e. the things all guitars have in common. The [[football]] article has no such common features section, because the only common features are those mentioned in the first sentence. Also, the [[guitar#History]] section is just a summary of a separate [[History of the classical guitar]] article.

: I agree that right now the naming of this article is a disservice to our readers. While it is true that the subject of this article is "football", it is also true that a general overview of sports involving kicked balls is not what the majority of the incoming links to this article are meant to point at, nor is it what most people who type "football" into the search bar are looking for. Our naming guidelines are meant to optimise article titles for ''findability'' and ''common use'' rather than accuracy; in this case, although this is true for a great many subjects, a generalist article is not the best fit for the root name.

As a reader, I'd expect to wind up at a dabpage. This will only complicate the issue further when the simplest solution is to set up a normal dabpage, as we would do with any other term with multiple meanings (even those that happend to share a common geneaology). There's also the rather obvious lack of consistency in implying that "XXX" is the same as "history of XXX".

****The point is not to vote on what content goes where, but to provide easier navigation among the many articles on football. Terms with multiple meanings, even if they share a common origin, are always handled with [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation]] and this should be no exception. Besides, just about all of relevant prose content of this article really does belongs in [[history of football]] no matter what the consensus turns out to be concerning the move. There's more than enough content to merit a separate history article. The heading "Football today" is basically just a summary of the dicdef article [[football (word)]] (which is already summarized properly under "Etymology") and a long list of the many football variants that exist today (disambiguation links).

*'''Oppose''' - If people here think its acceptable to have a "History of Football" article which covers the whole history of the different games known as football i dont quite understand why there can not be an article on Football for the same reason.  The introduction of this article provides a link to each of the different types of "football", i think its nicer with an introduction / explanation than just a simple dab page.

:* Most of the History section relates to the common early history, before the different codes split; each of those codes' histories is merely briefly [[WP:SUMMARY|summarised]] with a link to the relevant history articles. There is no summary of any other aspect of the codes, apart from the two paras in the lead relating to "common features".  As to whether it's "nicer", that's obviously a matter of opinion; I don't think it is. Finally, most of the 3000 inlinks are already mislinks that should point to one of the specific codes.  ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Football&namespace=0&limit=500&hideredirs=1 A random browse] will prove this; look at all the biography and placename articles for starters.)

*'''Oppose'''. As all of these sports are related, it makes sense to [[WP:SS|summarize]] them all in one place as a parent article. That doesn't mean there can't be a disambiguation page, but it's unnecessary to put it at the plain title when the applicable summary information is already guaranteed to be here. It's really not harder to navigate to a certain code here than on a disambiguation page; that's what the links in the table of contents are for.

I like the disambig page in itself though - I support [[Special:Contributions/76.66.200.21|76.66.200.21]]'s idea of creating that at [[Football (disambiguation)]], and perhaps deleting [[Football (word)]]. --[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 09:31, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I really don't get the reasoning of those opposing here. [[WP:DAB]] and common practice is ''always'' to create disambiguation for separate topics, even those with common origins. Take, for example, [[Joker]] or [[Victoria]]. And this is very clearly about separate topics, even if they all happen to be sports. That they happen to have a common origin is only an argument for keeping a joint article for the common ''history'' of the various sports. It's not, however, a tenable argument for keeping the modern, separate sports called "football" under a pseudo-summary rather than a normal dabpage. That would basically be the equivalent of making [[Springfield]] a common-history-but-also-a-kinda-dabpage-article just because they share the same name (and by extension the same origins). All of you opposing this move seem to be saying that this article should cover not ''one'' clearly defined topic, but ''multiple ones'', including all the variants of football ''and'' their joint histories. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding how any of this is compatible with some very basic policies and guidelines (unless you're actually invoking [[WP:IGNORE]]).

== Follow-up on move ==

I thought it a bit unfortunate that the request above was closed after only about a week. I would at least would have liked to see the discussion progress beyond mere misunderstandings of the intentions of the request. From what I can tell, though, there's no need to hold straw polls concerning one part of this request, namely to create a separate history article. The history info is already over 60k and is in dire need of a summary. If people keep adding info here, then more effort should be made to redirect them to the separate history article.

:I have moved "Present day codes and families" from the bottom to the top. If someone comes here and wants an article on a modern game we may as well put the links near the top. However I don't think the history should be moved out of this article as there was no consensus to do so in the requested move. Further as the major part of the edit history of this article is for editing the history section, I do not think that the history section should be moved out of this article, rather if after six months there is a consensus to do so this article should be moved to "history of football" (or whatever) and a new article created here. There is no hurry over this issue as the history part of this article has been here for many years and six months is neither her nor there. 

:I suggested to Peter on his talk page that one way forward would be to create a [[Football (disambiguation)]], with a [[wp:Hatnotes|hatnotes]] on [[Football]], leave it six months (the usual minimum time between requested name changes) and then try again when people are able to see what is being proposed.

Although I don't disagree that in a majority of the world thinks of football as the one with the round ball, it seems like there is a serious lack of NPOV in this article if there is no minimal subsection for American football under "Present day codes and families", especially since there are subsections for Irish and Australian varieties which have little similarity to their round ball cousin as well. --[[Special:Contributions/63.175.18.130|63.175.18.130]] ([[User talk:63.175.18.130|talk]]) 23:21, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

== Etymology ==

The first sentence of the article, "Football is the name of several similar team sports, all with similar origins which involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot in an attempt to score a goal." and the section "Etymology" both imply that the name of the sport is due to the interaction of the human foot and the ball. But this is not the case for all sports under discussion in the article. In particular, the amercian sport "football" (AKA American football, gridiron foot) is so named because the name of the ball used in play is "football" (the sport's name is taken from the ball and not the other way around), and the ball is called a "football" not due to any intended interaction with the foot but rather because, in it's original form, it's major axis was 1 foot in length.

Since the sections may be relevant for some or even most of the sports being discussed, simply changing it doesn't work, but I'm not entirely sure what the best solution is. Perhaps removing the mention of kicking in the first sentence and add breakdown by sport or class of sport for the etymology secion would work. What do others think?

:1. Football in the USA does involve attempting to score a goal by kicking. This is not the main aim of the sport, but then neither is it in rugby - hence 'to various degrees'
:2. Do you have any evidence for that name etymology for football in the USA? Surely it is more likely that it is known as football because it evolved from other forms of sport already known as football?
:3. The first line in etymology actually states that "While it is widely assumed that the word "football" (or "foot ball") references the action of the foot kicking a ball, there is a historical explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot". This seams pretty clear and also applies to American football. --[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 11:31, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:::OK - it would be nice if you responded to my other concerns with discussion rather than just throwing links at me. It's interesting that that etymology for American football is not mentioned on Wikipedia anywhere, even as a theory- it should be mentioned at [[History of American football]]. I'm still not convinced it makes sense, by the way: it sounds like [[urban legend]] to me. These sources contradict the 'foot length ball' claim ([http://www.library.georgetown.edu/special-collections/archives/essays/football[http://www.library.georgetown.edu/special-collections/archives/essays/football] [http://www.historyoffootball.net/]) and seem much more likely; I'd be surprised if American football developed a name shared by other sports in related nations, for entirely different reasons. Given the similarity of American football to, say, [[rugby league]], it seems much more likely that these are all different developments of one sport. And your argument about the source of the name still doesn't take away from my first and third points: that American football does involve kicking the ball to score a goal; and that the article itself suggests that the name football may not be related to 'kicking the ball' anyway [[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 09:08, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

== Ancient Greeks and Romans ==

"The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet." smacks of OR, because it suggests that football is derived from a game played with feet, yet we have in the section "Etymology" a suggestion that this may be a false etymology. Unless a source can be provided and attributed in the text, that these were "football" games not games played with feet, (or hands or some other part of the body), then quite frankly they could be included in the history of article on [[hand ball]], basketball or net ball.

Latest research has shown that football was first played in Germany. When the Romans unsuccessfully tried to conquer Germany they were shot at with footballs from inside the German defence. It is historically proven that the first German football club was established in 50BC in the Rhine Valley region. Roman coins from around 120AD show Germans playing football and defeating a Roman football team during a friendly played at the Roman-German boarder near Cologne. This is the final proof that football was established in Germany and not over 1,500 years later in the Roman province of Britain.   <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.143.126.149|86.143.126.149]] ([[User talk:86.143.126.149|talk]]) 17:48, 28 August 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

The word "football" does not originate from the fact that a ''foot'' makes contact with a ''ball'', it owes its name due to the fact that a game is played ''on foot'', because it was coined during medieval times when most sports were played by aristocrats on horseback. In that light, all sports referred to as ''football'' in their respective dialects are all accurate.

== Facts sustained by ground on the words 'soccer' and 'association football' - Please. ==

I found amusing how the terms ‘soccer’ and ‘association football’ are being pushed as official and widely known in the world by a partial group…

Reality is that the game that is called ‘football’, simply ‘football’ all over the world with the exception of a few countries (USA, Canada, partially Australia and New Zealand…) is about using your feet controlling a ball to score a goal.  I have looked all over the place, even on a visit to the UK in Cambridge, looking for records of the so claimed… origins of the word ‘soccer’…  There is none – Zero.

I have traveled and lived in different parts of the world, and with confidence can say that translations and the term used to refer to what is called ‘football’ is football (Calcio, fussball, futbol, futebol…), not soccer…  contrary to claims I see in some of these discussion posts.  There is plenty of evidence (facts and grounds - <UK Schools, Early European and South American Football clubs, Official football organizations worldwide - newspapers and media, FIFA oficial documents>) that support the fact that it has always been called football.  The terms ‘association football’ and ‘soccer’ have been forced, and for quite some time now strongly advocated by media organizations and fans of sports with a similar name to justify them…  Those are the only 'facts' I see in all these discussions and I have grounds to sustain them...  (see for yourself, simply read them)

So, it make sense to ask – Can you please provide facts and grounds to sustain those claims?  In simple words - why should the world consider and accept terms such as ‘soccer’ or ‘association football’ as a name for what the majority of the planet consider to be football?

Tibre, '''soccer''' is short for 'As'''''soc'''''iation football'. It's not an official name for Association football; it started as an English nickname. '''Calcio''' is also a nickname; it means 'stone', and only came to mean 'Association football' later. '''Soccer''' is formed similarly to '''rugger''', a nearly obsolete nickname for Rugby football. Football is a general name for both Association football and all other kinds of football. '''Soccer''' is a more specific name; it applies only to Association football, and not to any other form.

There is not exist the term '''"football association"''' . There is only '''"football"''' and it is ruled by FIFA. FIFA is the acronym of french '''"Fédération Internationale de Football Association"''' but today it is synonyn of '''"Intenational federation of football associations"'''. So, do not confuse. Every country have a institution created to rule its football, and that institution is called "national association of football". FIFA is conformed by the association of all "national associations". Football was created in england many years before that Americans invented "American Football". So, I think its wrong to use the world "soccer". by the way, only americanas use "soccer", because in England, in South Africa (where the last FIFA WORLD CUP took place), Europe, South America, and all over the world people say '''football, fútbol, futebol, etc'''.

== Naming Standardization In Different Codes ==

This has been a problem for awhile, and it needs a solution. I have two options that I'd like to offer to the community.

*Option #1. '''Using the name of the particular code uniformly, regardless of geography''' -- meaning that the terms [[American Football]], [[Canadian Football]], [[Association Football]], [[Rugby Football]], [[Australian Rules Football]] and [[Gaelic Football]] are used in articles instead of [[Football]] in all instances.

*Option #2. '''The [[WP:ENGVAR]] option''' Going by whatever the locals refer to as football. In [[NFL]] articles, that would mean [[American Football]], if you were talking about the [[FA Cup]], it would mean [[Association Football]]. For the [[Barrassi Line]], it would mean [[Australian Rules Football]], and so on.

* '''Query''' – why does it have to be standardised across the 6 sports you have mentioned (plus 2 versions of Rugby (league and union)) and dozens of countries? Might there not be places where the name 'football' is ambiguous and is not used without an adjective? I don't agree with Option 1: football means soccer in many countries where the others are not played at all, eg in most of Africa, where 'association football' is scarcely used. (Eg [http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&hl=en&q=nigeria+%22association+football%22 41,000 hits] and 7,000,000+ if you omit association; and these are not rugby hits.)

:: Basically due to regional bias and to avoid edit warring. If the ENGVAR route is best, then [[New England Patriots]] or [[Super Bowl]] should be [[football]] rather than [[American Football]] because in those areas, that's what it's called. Likewise, [[Manchester United]] or [[Real Madrid]] should then also be football, since that's what those teams play according to their fans. If there's a place that doesn't favor a specific code or uses different terminology, then that terminology can be used. [[User:Doc Quintana|Doc Quintana]] ([[User talk:Doc Quintana|talk]]) 19:29, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

I'm not sure that I agree there is much of a problem but just in case, here is my suggestion: in a single code article, the introductory sentence should state the exact football code but the rest of the article can use whatever the editors there feel is best. In an article mentioning two or more codes editors should avoid ambiguous use of 'football'. Doc Quintana, as you want to clear up use of the word 'football', please note that [[rugby football]] is now only a style of football, the terms for use in current articles should be [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league football]]. You mention the [[Barrassi Line]] in Australia, a place with four strong football codes, and declare it would mean Australian Rules - odd.

:::Just articles mentioning one code. Hold on, let me start another section explaining what I saw as the problem. [[User:Doc Quintana|Doc Quintana]] ([[User talk:Doc Quintana|talk]]) 21:37, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

===Reasoning Behind This===
I was browsing one day when I saw most of the [[NFL]] teams played [[American football]] rather than football while English football clubs played football rather than [[Association football]]. It seems that the two types of teams should be equal one way or another.

And when it comes articles relating to [[Major League Soccer]] teams, I think the term soccer is absolutely appropriate, because that's the terminology used in the United States to refer to the sport. However it's inappropriate on an article such as [[Manchester United]] or [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]] or what have you, because in the United Kingdom, what is known as Soccer in the US is known as Football.

There shouldn't be a bias towards American users or British users or users of any nationality. There should be one standard one way or the other -- either by using the code (either throughout the article or just in the beginning) or using the [[WP:ENGVAR|local terminology for the particular code]].

I apologize if I wasn't clearer before. [[User:Doc Quintana|Doc Quintana]] ([[User talk:Doc Quintana|talk]]) 21:36, 11 September 2010 (UTC)
:I'm not sure I see this as a major problem. I assume you are referring to piping whereby, for example, some players are being shown as a 'footballer' when the wiki link is pointing to American football or whatever? References to football should depend on the main usage of football in that area of the world, thus it would be appropriate for 'soccer' articles to just refer to football in most of the world, whereas in North America/Australia it would seem appropriate for 'soccer' to be mentioned at the start of the article, even though in all parts of the world the actual link should be to Association football. [[User:Eldumpo|Eldumpo]] ([[User talk:Eldumpo|talk]]) 08:15, 12 September 2010 (UTC)

: I'm not sure why this needs central discussion. We already use ENGVAR except for in the case of American football; it would thus seem that the problem lies with whoever is editing our American football articles, as everyone else is already getting it right.

::I don't know if it's really an ENGVAR matter. It's true Americans typically call American football just "football", but if there's some reason to specify it as "American football", they do. I think the fact that this is an international encyclopedia is a good enough reason to clarify. On the other hand people in Britain for instance do not normally call football/soccer anything besides "football". Additionally "American football", "Canadian football", etc., clears up which type of football is being discussed well enough for non-American or non-Canadian readers, whereas "association football" does not automatically make it clear to Americans or Canadians that the article is talking about the sport they call soccer.<br>

:::::I'm afraid its not that simple.  It isn't like at soome magic date in the past, there was only Association football, and then all of the other sports called football branched off of it.  It didn't happen that way.  There have almost ''always'' been a hodgepodge of sports of varying types called "football".  Some looked more like association football, some looked more like rugby, some looked a bit like both, and some looked like neither.  While the [[Cambridge rules]] date to 1848, Rugby's first written rules were drawn up in 1845, see [[History of rugby union]].  Both games were being played in parallel, and there is ample evidence that both were called "football", often unqualified, in their early years.  In America, games called football have been played for a long time.  Some, like [[Old division football]], more soccer-like date from the 1820's.  Others, such as the so called "Boston game", which was more rugby-like, date to the 1860's.  Its just not feasible, or correct, to say the oldest use of the term "football" refers unambiguously to association football.  In some places, and at some times, it means association football.  In other places and at other times, it meant something different.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 03:46, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

::::::::Sorry for the snarky comment, but I was more than a bit put off by the tone of the second response by Jayron. I was always under the impression that soccer dated beck to at least the 18th century, and even if the current rules weren't codified until 1848. If I was mistaken in that view (which I will determine through my own research), then so be it. My first statement was essentially support for what I'm assuming is the status quo (it not really being clear above), based on an assupmtion that it probably used the name "football" longer in England then any other code, and that it worth leaving it at the status quo, rather than trying to disrupt a current practice in WP association football articles. Obviously, as that view is not acceptable to some vocal rugby proponents, I see no reason to stick my neck out. That was the reason for adopting a stricter view, not because of Jayron's "history lesson" per se. I can live with either the status quo (mention specific code of football for all codes ecept for association football articles that don't already use "soccer", or the consistent in all articles view. However, I do not support the piping of "American/Canadian" football to show only "football", as this is an international encyclopedia, and the clarity is not disruptive or confusing. I hope that makes things clearer. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 07:58, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::See, I think the confusion is that my statements on the dates of rugby and soccer were not meant to be definitive, merely illustrative.  Yes, you can find references to games called football dating to the 17th century, or maybe even earlier.  However, the games that this word refer to was not necessarily soccer.  In fact, it likely wasn't, since soccer (association football) didn't really exist till much later.  There were games where people kicked the ball only which were called football.  There were games where people carried the ball and ran with it that were called football.  There were games where you could catch the ball, but not run with it, that were called football.  Sometimes handuse was allowed, sometimes not.  There were different rules regarding deciding a winner; regarding scoring; regarding the number of players or the goal of the game.  And all of these hundreds of different, unique games were all called football.  The name football, to identify a game, predates the existance of any of the modern codes of football, be they Gaelic, Australian, Association, Rugby, American, or Canadian.  Thus, the word football means different things depending on the context.  So, as with any application of [[WP:ENGVAR]], use the context of the article to decide on word usage.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 02:17, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

== RFC: Association football ==

This sort of a carry on of the RFC which I think raised a valid point but came at it from the wrong angle. The vast majority of articles for the other football codes will [[WP:DAB]] the first usage of football. The only code that currently doesn't do this to any great degree is Association football. Should football be [[WP:DAB]]'d for all codes when the code is first mentioned in the intro? [[User:Gnevin|Gnevin]] ([[User talk:Gnevin|talk]]) 21:04, 27 September 2010 (UTC)
: It would certainly seem sensible for articles relating to code of football to make it clear which code they mean early on. The current move to remove this information in a quest for some sort of parity seems to be a move in the wrong direction; better to look at making all articles clear rather than making them all equally unclear.

*I'm not opposed to disambiguation per-se.

{{unindent}}We need to consider how other encyclopedias handle this situation. ''Britannica'', which uses British English, regardless always disambiguates which code is meant. [[Pele]] is a [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/449124/Pele "football (soccer) player"]. Same for [[David Beckham]][http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/760149/David-Beckham]. American player [[Mia Hamm]] is also a [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253562/Mia-Hamm "football (soccer) player"]. On the other hand [[Dan Marino]] is a [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1382038/Dan-Marino "gridiron football player]", and the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] are a "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1710505/Jacksonville-Jaguars "professional gridiron football team"] (Britannica doesn't have separate articles on American and Canadian football; they are both discussed under [[gridiron football]]). The American ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' also distinguishes the sports, though using the American standard. Pele is a [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Pele_%28soccer_player%29.aspx "Brazilian soccer (football) player"] while Beckham is an [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/David_Beckham.aspx "English soccer player"] and Hamm is a [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Mia_Hamm.aspx#1E1-HammMia "U.S. soccer player"]. Dan Marino is an [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-MarinoDn.html "American football player"] as is [[John Elway]][http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-ElwayJ.html] and others.<br>
These two encyclopedias clearly make a conscious effort to distinguish which type of football is being referred to, and don't refer to any one sport as "football" without disambiguating it in the text. I suppose one could argue that in ''Columbia'', it is Marino, Elway, et al who are "American" and the sport is being referred to as "football", but it's really immaterial since they are both U.S. citizens and play what Columbia calls "American football". Additionally Mia Hamm, the only American soccer player to have an article, is called a "U.S. soccer player" rather than "American soccer player". The only player of any type of football besides soccer and American to have an article is [[Warren Moon]]; he played Canadian football for several years, but was actually American and played in the National Football League too. Columbia calls him an [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-MoonWarn.html "African-American football player"] and then refers to the leagues he played in.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|<sup>t</sup>]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|<small>c</small>]] 15:46, 29 September 2010 (UTC)

:English Wikipedia is not US Wikipedia or UK Wikipedia, and there should be no linguistic imperialism of using  the undisambiguated term "football" to refer to the kind that some editor prefers and requiring a disambiguating adjective only for "the other kind."

[[User:Edison|Edison]] ([[User talk:Edison|talk]]) 15:48, 5 October 2010 (UTC)
*I would suggest that the disambiguation can often be done via piped links. For example, [[David Beckham]] currently begins as follows: "'''David Robert Joseph Beckham''', <small>[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]</small> (born 2 May 1975) is an English [[association football|footballer]] ...." One can see just by mousing over the word "footballer" that the code he plays in is [[association football]]. That's fine; that's all that is needed to disambiguate "football" in this context. We don't need to rephrase the sentence to spell out that his football code is soccer as opposed to American football or Australian rules or whatever. However, if there are any players whose pages only link to [[football]] and not to a particular code thereof, those pages should be disambiguated. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] [[User talk:Metropolitan90|(talk)]] 02:40, 6 October 2010 (UTC)

:::[[WP:VNE|Opportunities for commonality]] are only necessary when there is a phrase that is not in use in some parts of the English speaking world.  No-one in England does not know and understand the word "soccer": it is in widespread use in the media, there are popular programmes called Soccer Saturday, Soccer a.m. etc, ''World Soccer'' magazine is a London publication.  The aversion to the word is frankly an arrogant rejection of the vocabulary of those who do not share the sport as a priority (rugby fans, who until fairly recently would have typically called the 11 man game "soccer")  and "foreign types".  An Englishman, speaking to an American (or Irish GAA fan/Aussie/South African etc etc etc) wishing to confirm that he is speaking about the game supervised by FIFA would be most unlikely to use the phrase "association football" to make the clarification, no matter how averse he is to the "s-word".  [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 19:58, 19 October 2010 (UTC)
On reflection, people in England who are already familiar with the Football Association could probably make  the right guess as to what 'association footballer' meant, if not by just seeing the word 'footballer' and applying the English (England) common usage. However, as a 'no prior knowledge/out of area' disambiguator, it's not very useful, because it excludes non-English people and non-English VAR football people. So to be totally correct, I think it would have to be something like association footballer (soccer) even on English articles, and I really don't think that is going to fly with the wider editorship or even casual gnoming readers, so I foresee years and years of active corrections against the tide. Which is not the sign of a good solution. [[User:MickMacNee|MickMacNee]] ([[User talk:MickMacNee|talk]]) 10:34, 19 October 2010 (UTC)

*As I said before, there is an argument for expanding on "[[association football|football]]". But the DAB argument is flawed, and as far as I can tell primarily comes from the Irish perspective. In Britain (the island), France, Italy and Argentina, rugby codes are known as either "rugby" or their longer names. Bearing in mind that there isn't a professional association football league on the island of Ireland, association football is the dominant code in all other European countries with a professional league, plus Brazil, where a very high proportion of notable [[association football|footballers]] spend their careers. In these countries, there is no ambiguity. In Australian, American, Canadian, Irish or South African contexts, the use of football is quite well established to mean something else. To summarise, nobody has given a convincing argument against Oldelpaso's comment that this proposal assumes that our readers are stupid. In response to the one valid point made on that subject, if it is fair to assume that 100% of British readers understand the word soccer, it is equally fair to assume that 100% of Americans and Irish are aware that the British call it football. —[[User:WFCforLife|W]][[User talk:WFCforLife|F]][[Special:Contributions/WFCforLife|C]]— 06:12, 20 October 2010 (UTC)

::::::::::::::::I have far less objections to the word soccer. I've used it myself on articles where the player may cross different cultures, particularly one English player in America, where I think the term "footballer (soccer player)" is far more preferable to "association footballer". Everyone knows what you mean then. However, I would be less inclined to try force the term soccer on all football articles where it's less relevant. [[User:Brad78|Brad78]] ([[User talk:Brad78|talk]]) 17:51, 28 October 2010 (UTC)
:::::::::Yet this article, [[football]], is not about association football. English WP is an international encyclopedia, and the word "football" is not exclusiv e to soccer in English. The project title should not be either - its just commont sense. I have no issue with [[WP:FOOTY]] being a redirect to [[WP:Association football]], or [[WP:Football (soccer)]], but some of the other code supporters may. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]])

===Arbitrary heading 2===
:Going back to your US/Canada example, if there is a need to distinguish between two codes of football in those countries, football (soccer) is never (if ever) qualified with the appropriate adjective. One is most likely to say "football and Canadian/American football". The same applies when it comes to disambiguating football (soccer) and the other codes. The chance of anyone saying "association football and football" (to mean any other code) is extremely rare because "association football", as a term, is rare in usage. That's why "football club" and "football association/federation" widely refers to organizational bodies of football/soccer. We should not apply a term in articles that is very rare in usage to something as common as this sport; the other codes don't have that "problem". This is reflected not just in usage by native English speakers, also speakers of English as a second language. [[User:Digirami|Digirami]] ([[User talk:Digirami|talk]]) 21:39, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
::I'm not sure where you make this stuff up from but it's not true. In the US/Canada they call it Soccer so the DAB is generally done, if soemone does say football meaning the Association type and there is confusion the will most likely say soccer. In the US/Canada football to them is one of the gridiron codes  . The parent article of all these articles is at association football so its clearly not that uncommon.
::'' We should not apply a term in articles that is very rare in usage to something as common as this sport'' then use soccer to DAB [[User:Gnevin|Gnevin]] ([[User talk:Gnevin|talk]]) 21:46, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
::P.S all these typos of arguments where made and rejected when association football was moved to current location . Attempting to reheat them here is not helpful [[User:Gnevin|Gnevin]] ([[User talk:Gnevin|talk]]) 21:50, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
:::Your last point is moot. There is a difference between the naming convention of an article title and the rewording of one term in thousands of others.
:::And I can guarantee you I'm not making this stuff up. While [[Dan Marino]] is known as a football player, saying he is an American football player won't lead to any confusion. Americans know their code of football to be properly known as American football. With DAB, its still clear in the end. The same does not apply to association football. Common vernacular does not disambiguate this code of football; its the others, way more often than not, that do. Prose should reflect that.

::::''he same does not apply to association football. Common vernacular does not disambiguate this code of football;'' Really I would say Association football has a very very common DAB . '''Soccer'''. This term is used all the time and in fact is the main way the code is referred to in North America

Can I suggest setting out statements of opinions, agreements and disagreements? This debate has already reached a length of complexity and dispute which means that people coming in will find it difficult to contribute usefully. For what it's worth, I think there are two separate things going on here. I think the soccer v association football portion of this debate needs to be set aside from the 'disambiguation' portion. Firstly decide if disambiguation is necessary, then worry about the terminology.

On the latter I have little to no preference and I think that the majority of anti-'soccer' complainants are probably making quick reactionary decisions, as well as not appreciating the widespread use of the word soccer within England prior to any sort of Americanizaiton issue. On the former - I really don't think insisting on removing the word 'footballer' from any sort of football related article for the sake of consistency or clarification is necessary or desirable. There are usually a number of contextual pieces of information on a page which indicates which code of football that a subject plays (goals/points scoring achievements, club names, position names, etc). Also, is there any evidence of anyone ever failing to work out pretty quickly which code of football an individual plays?

::That is a very sensible approach, Pretty Green. As to whether using "football" without qualification actually confuses readers, I would say yes, definitely. I noted above that ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', which uses British English, always uses the qualifier "football (soccer)" the first time they mention it in their articles. Clearly they find that enough of their readership would be confused if they just said "football" to warrant some explanation. And Wikipedia has another whole layer of confusion, in that we don't use only one variety of English, so we can't just rely on readers coming in saying "oh, Wikipedia uses British English, when they say "football" they mean soccer". We use many different varieties of English, and the word "football" refers to different things in different places, so we need to recognize that.--[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|<sup>t</sup>]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|<small>c</small>]] 01:41, 29 October 2010 (UTC)

{{unindent}}ENGVAR says that "The English Wikipedia does not prefer any major national variety of the language". It does ''not'' say that we stick to one national variety of English rigidly, even if it may confuse speakers of other varieties. The [[WP:COMMONALITY]] section specifically address this problem. "Universally used terms are often preferable to less widely distributed terms". "Use a commonly understood word or phrase in preference to one that has a different meaning because of national differences". "Terms that are uncommon in some varieties of English, or that have divergent meanings, may be glossed to prevent confusion. Insisting on a single term or a single usage as the only correct option does not serve the purposes of an international encyclopedia."

::::I don't think sledgehammer and nut does a hatnote justice, but I do like the way of thinking. A hatnote itself would be too problematic to consider. Firstly because WP:FOOTY alone has over 125,000 articles, not to mention all the other articles from all the other codes. It would also be visually intrusive, and would have ongoing problems in implementation. Sure, a bot could do the initial run, but what's to say that no-one would remove them en-masse? What's to say that it would be ''wrong'' to remove them en-masse if articles are using the phrase "appropriately" (whatever the hell that means)? 
::::If it were possible to do something along the lines of [[User:Pyrospirit/metadata|this gadget]], no maintenance would be needed, as the hatnote could then feed off of the wikiproject assessments on the talk page to determine what code the page references.

:I'm afraid I don't see the need for a single term to be used everywhere. Where confusion is possible or where national variations of English hold it as standard, then 'soccer player' is the best option - I'm against unnecessary uses of qualifiers in brackets. Where an English footballer plays in the USA, for example, we can use common sense - David Beckham would remain a 'footballer' because he has a sufficiently high profile for people to know that he plays association football; I think [[Jason Griffiths]] should probably be described as a soccer player. Similarly, I'd think it reasonable that [[Brad Friedel]] remains a 'soccer' player. I agree, essentially, with the title of this subsection and the comments that unnecessary standardisation helps no-one when it creates phrases and sentences that are counter-intuitive. On a pragmatic note, too, if we go through all English footballer's articles changing the phrase to 'association footballer' or 'soccer player' then we'll set ourselves up for never-ending vandalism/well-intentioned edits back to 'footballer'.

::::I agree that a contextless 'football' is ambiguous. But, with the exception of a very short stub article, the word football does not appear in Wikipedia without that context - images, phrases, points scoring statistics, which should identify what is being discussed (there might be an exception of potential confusion between Ozzie Rules and Gaelic football). This is the principle that ENGVAR works on; the meaning should be apparent in most articles from the wider context. If it isn't, it's probably a failure in the article, not the use of the terminology. If someone can't identify which football is being discussed from all of these clues, they probably need to be reading the football article anyway!

::::::::No-one's denying that there are some circumstances where disambiguation is necessary. Indeed I'd go further than Pretty.

They should either be described as soccer players, or with one of the forms used above if their career was predominantly spent in countries that call it football. But as a general rule, Pretty is correct; context is the important thing. There's certainly a debate to be had on what constitutes sufficient context, as I have said all along. But to insist that you are right, that the solutions that you have put on the table are the only viable options, and that everyone who disagrees is lacking in common sense is a surefire way to kill this discussion without resolution.

:::::::::*First two points duly noted. But a physical hatnote maintained by a bot will not work. People ''will'' remove them, and shut the bot down if necessary. Sometimes with the justification that the context is abundantly clear from the opening paragraph, sometimes because the article actually uses the phrase association football (or soccer throughout), sometimes because neither of the above have happened but authors simply hate the look of it. I believe this would end up either with the bot operator refusing to continue, or at arbcom if they continued in spite of widespread calls to cease or mass disruption on the parts of all concerned. If a manditory header is the route we're going down, it would need to be technical in nature, along the lines of the gadget I mentioned above, and would need to be universal across football codes.
:::::::::*But even that is far more complicated and controversial than simply requiring that the word "football" only be used alone if sufficient context is provided, for instance "Joe Bloggs (D.O.B.) was an English [[association football|footballer]]. During his career he played in the [[Premier League]] for Foo Town, before moving to Spanish club Athletic FuFu, with whom he won two [[La Liga]] titles, as well as the [[UEFA Champions League]]." Footballer alone is a big clue, as is nationality, and the second sentence removes any possible remaining doubt. —[[User:WFCforLife|W]][[User talk:WFCforLife|F]][[Special:Contributions/WFCforLife|C]]— 04:57, 3 November 2010 (UTC)
::::::::::*If we never try we will never know. At the moment the consensus here if for a hat note. I'd suggest the approach I take with [[WP:FLAG]] I remove them offering a link to the correct part of MOS . If the undo revert I revert asking for an explanation if none is forth coming and they revert again I just leave it be.

Let's agree that it works in in the cases such as WFC's suggested one. Most English speakers will know that the English use "football" for association football, and anyone interested enough to look it up will probably know what the [[Premier League]] is or catch on quickly. But what about [[Japan Football Association|Japan]]? [[Samoa national football team|Samoa]]? [[Papua New Guinea national football team|Papua New Guinea]]? In these cases there are limited clues for the unfamiliar as to the sport being described, we're simply assuming that in a vacuum, the English-speaking reader will understand the word "football" to mean soccer.

::: @ Cuchullain And I wouldn't say that in these situations the editor shouldn't do more to consider the appropriate phrase. As I pointed out, Ozzie rules and Gaelic footballers might have to be differentiated from each other, because of the similarity in vocab. Similarly, it might be/is more appropriate to use 'soccer' for Irish or American players, which is largely the case as things stand. But these are issues with the quality of writing in individual articles ,rather than cause for imposing cross-wiki standards. I'm confused by your examples above - are you referring to the article titles or the text in the articles? If you're talking about the article titles then that's a different issue of article naming and should be put aside. But within the article - well each of the three has a large image of a soccer-ball on the right hand side and uses the word 'FIFA'. I'd say that we're not assuming that it is identifiable in a vacuum at all; and if an article ''is'' a vacuum then it's a flawed article, which is not a reason to alter well written articles. An example of an improper use of 'footballer' is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erroll_Bennett&oldid=392691875 Erroll Bennett] (if this article is notable, which I suspect it might not be). This could be improved by altering to soccer player or association footballer, but the best solution is to improve the article 
::: @Gnevin I think that given the issue here is readability, rather than what word to use, you're as well going for a generic RFC, or maybe to a copyediting wikiproject (which I think we have somewhere).[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 15:22, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

::::To Pretty Green, I was referring to the text in the articles. And an image with a little soccer ball in it is not sufficient, nor is one link to [[FIFA]] really sufficient. Adding other context clues is all well and good, but the easiest way to fix those articles and others, plain and simple, is to add a simple disambiguation in the first sentence indicating exactly which sport is meant. In the examples I gave, none of those countries speak English, and soccer is not particularly popular in any of them (indeed, in Samoa, it is probably significantly less popular than either [[Aussie Rules Football]] or [[American football]], let alone Rugby).

:Can you clarify this? If you're referring to printed from the web, then that implies that someone has access to the full website as is and can thus gain further information. Furthermore, its unlikely that someone is going to print a page, at random, if they are so unsure about the topic that they don't know which code of football is being discussed. If you're referring to the published versions of Wikipedia, then any article matching the [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Release Version Criteria|publishing criteria]] would have to be written to a sufficient standard as to make it clear which code of football was being discussed. I just think that this is a question of article quality. If articles fail to make clear what it being discussed, that is a reason to improve that article.

:::Sorry guys, have been a bit busy this week. A specific RFC on a hatnote/technical equivalent might be a good idea.

Incidentally, if my understanding is incorrect, the only appropriate wikiproject to inform would be WP:FOOTY, which would make the chances of consensus in favour of a hatnote nil anyway. 
:::Gnevin: I would urge you not to take the same approach as you take with flags. With flags, policy is clearly in favour of removing or expanding upon flags where there is no key or other explanation (albeit some editors had legitimate reservations on the way in which these changes were applied, and there are logistical issues in some instances that cannot be ignored).

I gather that rugby union is in general more popular in the US, but not enough so that simply saying "rugby" is automatically unambigious, and most people wouldn't know the difference anyway. As an anecdote, I have a friend who used to play intramural "rugby" at the [[University of North Florida]]. Not too long ago I asked him which kind he played, and he had no idea; we had to go over the rules (15 players, 5-point tries) to figure out that he played rugby union.

<noindent> RE point one, I fundamentally disagree. We can make reasonable assumptions of levels of information that exist about different people and institutions. These articles are ''not'' read by hypothetical visitors from Mars, they are not read in isolation; rather they are read by socially located and constituted people who have certain levels of interest, information and knowledge. Now clearly there is no objective point at which a person or institution's level of fame or notability reaches a certain level at which we can presume no disambiguation is required; this is why I'd consider the hatnote as appropriate where: a. the article introduction does not provide sufficient terminology or imagery to identify the code played; or b., more than one version of ENGVAR can apply to the article AND the the subject of article is not regularly represented as a player of their code. By that definition, Beckham's regular appearances as a footballer in news, popular culture etc would mean that no disambig is required (I'd say the same for [[Roy Keane]]). [[David O'Leary]], on the other hand, would probably need it, not least because the article is much less explicit as to which code is discussed. 

As for point two, I'm not sure. I'd rather have one term and in that sense 'association football' is the most universal, precisely because it avoids national variations and because it is the name of the wiki-article. --[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 11:35, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

I note that the template has not yet gained consensus, and is facing some opposition, yet has already been applied on some articles. I have removed it from those articles where the football code is linked in the first sentence as it is unnecessary and against [[WP:Overlink]]. There may well be a use for it on some articles where the code is not immediately clear - indeed, I have left it in place on [[Dublin GAA]] and [[Wayne Jackson (footballer)]] as neither of those articles are clear as to which code is being discussed. I feel there may well be some use for the template, though it would need to be applied with care, and guidance as to its appropriate use would be valuable and welcome.

===Close note===
A discussion was opened on 11 September by Doc Quintana on the feasibility of standarising the term "football". By 27 September there was no consensus for changes to the status quo, so a new RFC was started by Gnevin on a proposal to DAB the first usage of the term "football" in articles. This proposal has also failed to gain consensus. As part of maintaining the CENT template I closed the discussion with the following comment: "There has been an admirable attempt to provide useful clarity to the ambiguity of the term "football"; however, after much discussion and the putting forward of several alternatives, there is no consensus on standarization. The preferred state is to continue using [[WP:ENGVAR]]. Conclusion: No change." Gnevin feels there is still valid and useful discussion taking place and has reverted the close so discussion can continue. Please note that this discussion is no longer linked from CENT, though can be linked from there again if a new and feasible proposal emerges from the ongoing discussion. <span style="border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;">'''[[User:SilkTork|<font face="Script MT" color="#1111AA" size="2">SilkTork</font>]]''' *[[User talk:SilkTork|<sup>YES!</sup>]]</span> 09:38, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

:I conclude from the above that the consensus is that hatnotes on every page is not a solution to the problem. But is there consensus on whether there is a problem at all that needs to be solved? I think there is a small problem. For example: the current DYK-article [[1887 Michigan Wolverines football team]] seriously had me puzzled for a while. The hook says that they taught their opponents "how to play the game of football". It did not say which kind of football, so I went to the article. It did not explicitly say it. I know Michigan is a US town, so I expected it to be American Football, but the image in the infobox does not show the familiar protection used in that sport. My guess was that in 1887 they played American Football without protection, but it could as well be rugby that they are playing. I had to follow three links before I could confirm it was American Football that they played. Other readers could run into similar problems.
:These problems would be solved if every article on football had a hatnote indicating which kind of football is meant, but as written above, this is not an acceptable solution. In most articles, people will know the context, and then it is not needed. Action is only needed when readers come to an article without knowing the context. Is is therefore perhaps an idea to require DYK, FA's and GA's to show which kind of football is used (not as a rule, but as a guideline)?
:To me, showing which kind of football does not have to be directly with a hatnote or in the prose. [[Manchester United F.C.]] says they play in the Premier League and won the UEFA champions league, both of which are clearly "association football" as can be read in their article. For [[Strathmore Football Club]], if it wasn't for the explicit mention in the first sentence, you'd have to follow at least two links before you know which type of football they play. I know that "how many links you need to follow before you find out" is not a good basis for a rule, because there might be people reading a paper version. I just put it here because somebody might improve this thought into something that does work. --[[User:EdgeNavidad|EdgeNavidad]] <small>([[User talk:EdgeNavidad|Talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/EdgeNavidad|Contribs]])</small> 16:25, 24 November 2010 (UTC)
::Hi Edge - yes, I think it should be clear from any article what version of football is being discussed.

I'd have no problem with the hat-notes being ''an option'' - we could create a subpage for them at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Football]] link to them from the various relevant Wikiprojects - but two alternatives would also be to use the formalised term eg 'American Football' or to rewrite the article to provide sufficient context. --[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 09:33, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

== “In some countries” ==

Forgive me for not trawling through the entire archive if this has already been covered, but can I take out the part about ''in some countries this form of football also became known as "soccer"''? <small>AFAIK</small>, it became known as soccer in ''all'' countries, with that form becoming dominant in countries that developed their own codes. But “soccer” is an [[England|English]] coining, and, as I understand it, only fell out of favour later when it came to be perceived as an Americanism (sort of like ''-ize''). —[[User talk:Wiki Wikardo|Wiki Wikardo]] 01:52, 1 July 2011 (UTC)


:I wouldn't say the use of soccer has fell out of favour because of the perception it is an Americanism; there has always been a class-based preference to use it or not, and of course it is used by those who want to distinguish between other codes (e.g. Rugby). I would argue that the use of ''soccer'' and ''football'' for the same game is long established in England, and whilst people understand that the two words can refer to the same sport, there is a push back at attempts to impose the sole use of the word ''soccer'' by foreigners.

::Wiki Wikardo is right. "Soccer" (or "socca", "socker", etc.) was certainly in use in Britain from the 19th century, so saying it was only used in "some" countries is a little off. It's also certain that both the terms "soccer" and "association football" are in decline in Britain and in other countries as well. There are likely a number of reasons for this, but yes, one of the big factors is definitely the misconception that it's an "Americanism" (or at least a "foreignism").[[User:Cuchullain|Cúchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|<sup>t</sup>]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|<small>c</small>]] 14:22, 1 July 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' For starters, [[Football (broad)]] is a crap title. I'm also not entirely sure why this concept is described as either made up or obscure? For comparison, the online version of the academic [[encyclopedia britannica]] (ie the version I can quickly access!) contains an article with the title 'Football' which opens with the following text: "Football, any number of related games, all of which are characterized by two persons or teams attempting to kick, carry, throw or otherwise propel a ball towards an opponent's goal...".

*'''Oppose'''; I'll invoke IAR here.  While it is likely that readers are searching for one specific football code or another (without any single code being dominant), putting the overview article at this title is an elegant alternative to showing the disambiguation page first.  [[WP:AT]] cannot possibly account for every possible case we might encounter in article naming, and at some point, common sense must prevail even if there isn't a rule for it in a policy document.

== Gridiron football? ==

Why is this being used as the term for the codes of football played primarily in the USA and Canada?  I understand there is some difficulty in finding a term as it's only really known as "football" where it's played; however, gridiron, at least in the part of the world where it's actually played is far more often used to merely refer to the field the game is played on or as a descriptor (e.g. "gridiron greats").  Rarely is the term ever used alone.  
It seems that North American/American football would be a better term.  The regional moniker is both fitting (the two countries wherein it is primarily played make up the majority of North America) and used to specify other codes (Australian Rules Football, Gaelic Football).

I do understand that it is referred to as "gridiron" by the Australians and New Zealanders, but I'm not entirely sure that this would be a proper "world view" term for the sport...  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.142.178.21|67.142.178.21]] ([[User talk:67.142.178.21|talk]]) 02:09, 17 September 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

While I wholly admit to having only what could be generously described as limited discussions with Europeans concerning sport (and admit to this being anecdotal as well), in each case, when the topic of football came up, it was described as some variation of "American football" and clearly understood.  That phrasing even seems to be clear to those in the Southern Hemisphere where "gridiron" is the preferred, again, from my experiences.

It just seems an overly non-intuitive manner of referring to the sport and an almost ham-fisted over-correction in the name of "world view" that seems to take that to mean avoiding reference to "America", even when it would be logical.

But I could be wrong.  I'll sleep well either way.  [[Special:Contributions/67.142.178.21|67.142.178.21]] ([[User talk:67.142.178.21|talk]]) 03:42, 17 September 2011 (UTC)

I looked into it a little more and want to direct you to:  [[International Federation of American Football]] which seems to be an international body headquartered in France that takes the name "American Football", along with some associated non-American national organizations that also refer to it as American Football.  Membership in GAISF (detailed in that article) also seems to make the name more officially internationally recognized.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.142.178.21|67.142.178.21]] ([[User talk:67.142.178.21|talk]]) 04:05, 17 September 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Eh, "The IFAF includes Canadian football in its definition of the term American football, despite differences between the two; in international competitions, the Canadian teams play by American rules."

The differentiation between the two is fairly well overblown.  A Canadian team and a States team of comparable level could take the field against one another under either set of rules and compete effectively against one another.  Could you say that of an Aussie Rules side and a Rugby side -- or really any combination of the codes. 

While it is true there are other variations such as Arena and x-man teams (typically played by smaller population areas that can't field a full team roster), these are variations of the sport just as the other major codes have variations such as sevens, five on five, etc. etc.  Rugby football is still rugby football even though there are variations of the time played, the number of players per side, and other various incidental rules that while changing certain aspects, still share much. 

Add into this the fact that as much as they sometimes don't like to admit sharing a continent with us, Canada is also on the continent of North America.  While I'm sure our esteemed neighbors to the North often bristle at our hogging of the term "American" to mean from the USA, that still doesn't make calling it "American Football" any less correct, nor does it affect the recognition of the term "American Football" to refer to that game kinda like rugby but with pads.  

This just reeks of "do everything possible to avoid using 'American'" -- try an experiment:  go to the google site for various English speaking countries (e.g. google.co.uk).  Once there, search for "american football".  Take note of the topics of the results.  Then do the same for "gridiron".  Then do the same for "gridiron football".  You'll find that the latter most search with only two exceptions (and even then they're not terribly strong:  NZ and AUS) will *not* be as strongly related to the sport.

Well gents, it's been a fun discussion.  However, bed calls.  I wish you the best in your decision.

It is in some sources, (eg [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football here]) but other sources apply it to American football only.

== Text inaccuracy or unclear point ==

The text says the following:

In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.

The last statement ("This is the earliest reference to football") seems inaccurate, as several prior references immediately precede this paragraph, including "Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard."

Unsure of what change is really most appropriate, I appeal to the experts to consider it.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/221.201.68.25|221.201.68.25]] ([[User talk:221.201.68.25|talk]]) 06:40, 20 September 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== "Codes of football" misleading ==

The article needs a generic term for what (1) soccer or "football", (2) American football or "football",
(3) Canadian football or "football", (4) rugby "football", (5) Australian... -- okay, that's enough,
you get the idea -- are all examples of.  For this generic term the article uses "codes of football".

To me this term seems completely wrong, because "code" means a set of rules and the phrase carries a
strong implication that these are alternative rules for different forms of the same sport.  And they aren't.  Four of the five I listed are distinct sports that, for historical reasons, happen to confusingly share the same name.  American and Canadian football I would agree are forms of the same sport.  So to me,
"codes of football" to me suggests NFL rules, NCAA rules, CFL rules, and so on -- it would not include the rules of Gaelic football or Australian football, even though I have no problem with the idea that "football" occurs in the names of those sports.  Similarly, if I was one of those people to whom "football" exclusively means what I call soccer, then I would take "codes of football" to mean the FA rules, the FIFA rules, the MLS rules, and so on -- but not including anything to do with American football.

I've gone into why I think the phrase used is wrong and should be changed, but I don't have a very good replacement to suggest.  "Games called football" or "sports called football" is the best I have.

And that's all I'm going to say about this -- I don't even plan to read replies to this message, at least not any time soon.  Please reply here and not on the talk page for my IP address.  If other people agree that this phrase should be changed in the article, then someone else can change it.  If most people think my view is wrong, that's that.

::'''the phrase carries a strong implication that these are alternative rules for different forms of the same sport.''' Only if you are mired in the idea that the word football means a particular variety (admittedly, a common trait here at WP). Otherwise, it's easily understandable.

:You raise a good point that is worth thinking about and I initially agreed with your argument. However, 'codes' is a relatively standard term used beyond this article eg [[List of players who have converted from one football code to another]]. Wikipedia is an ecnyclopedia so its not up to us to come up with words to describe things, but to use and explain the commonly used terms in [[WP:SOURCE|reliable sources]]. To that, end, I think inserting a reference or explanation for the word code (see [http://www.convictcreations.com/football/codebattle.htm][http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0007/print.shtml][http://www.brfc-supportersclub.co.uk/history.html][http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/franchamp.html]) is the best bet.

== Intro ==

This article needs a longer intro. It's comfortably over 30,000 characters long and so according to Wikipedia's [[WP:LEAD]] guidelines should have three or four paragraphs. However, this page clearly serves some sort of disambiguating function; a shorter lead than the guidelines suggest is therefore acceptable, but certainly I think it would benefit from a second paragraph. 

In particular, these guidelines tell us that ''the lead should establish significance'' of a topic, which the current lead completely fails to do. Merging a bit more history in with the establishment of the significance of the topic was aim in the paragraph that I created earlier today, which was reverted. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Football&action=historysubmit&diff=470427845&oldid=470413303 I have reverted back, once], on the grounds that I think the editor's given objections are mistaken. Firstly, the added paragraph does not extend the lead too much; rather, it brings the lead closer to expected lengths (of which it still falls short; however, I can see a justification for a short lead on this article). Secondly, the added paragraph fulfils some of the tasks of the lead that were not previously being fulfilled. Thirdly, as per [[WP:LEADCITE]], citations are not required in the lead in the same way they are elsewhere in the text; in particular, the lead adds little new information which is not already cited in the text (I note that the previously existing paragraph has no citations) and so doesn't require citations: they could be added by being pulled up from the body text, but this interrupts the numbering of footnotes somewhat and isn't necessarily desirable. The one new bit of information added to the lead ''is'' cited.

Now of course, I'd expect this addition to be edited and improved, that's the whole point of Wikipedia. But I really don't think it should be removed wholesale - its existence corrects flaws in the current article, bringing it closer to Wikipedia's Manual of Style. --[[User:Pretty Green|Pretty Green]] ([[User talk:Pretty Green|talk]]) 13:18, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

:[[WP:LEAD]] states that introductions should be carefully sourced ''as appropriate''. Your version's got a few problems:

::* The lone citation does not contain a page reference. 
::* "Contemporary codes of football can all be traced back to the English public school football games of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, although other regional forms of football (for example, Caid in Ireland) influenced the development of the local code." This probably makes almost no sense to somebody not already familiar with the topic and would not become clearer even if they chose to follow the link provided. The section that mentions ''Caid'' does not make any claim regarding influence on "local code"; the only thing close to this that I was able to find were the final two sentences in the Gaelic football section: "Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).". All of which is [[WP:SYNTH]] and (yep) unsourced; so I'd advise against using it as the basis for specific introductory statements. There also seems to be some contradiction: if '''all contemporary football codes''' developed from those of 18th/19th century English public schools, how does ''Caid'', as  "[an]other regional form of football" fit in in terms of influencing local Irish codes? What were these local codes, how did they develop, and what happened to them, if all contemporary forms of football, including Gaelic football, developed from the 18th/19th public school game?   
::* "The influence and power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread". I could have missed it, but I can't find this claim in the article. Either that statement is found somewhere in the article and is well sourced, or it's just more WP:SYNTH based on the history of football games played in the colonies. Use of the phrase "influence and power" in explaining the spread of the early rules of the game looks dangerously POVish too, but that's less worrying than everything else...

:I'm not bothered enough to re-revert, but those are major issues in an article that is already overflowing with unsourced statements and synthesis. The lead could do without it. [[User:Bryccan|Bryccan]] ([[User talk:Bryccan|talk]]) 15:54, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

::Fair enough - I appreciate the constructive comments rather than the revert. Frankly, I wrote it quickly for others to improve because the article needs a longer introduction. I've taken on your comments. Although I '''strongly''' disagree the claim that the Caid example is contradictory - something can develop from one thing, but in doing so be influenced by something else - it does come from a part of the article which is itself not sourced. Accordingly, I've toned down that claim.
::I think that the other two claims - that English public schools and the British Empire were the sources of the spread of these early rules - are in the article, though again I'll accept that they are implied via the overall article and not state clearly in one place.

== McGill?  Really? ==

Wikipedia provides an endless source of entertainment to those who view it as a lens into the way that Canadians view themselves and their relationship to the rest of the world.  Continuously underestimated and underappreciated, Wikipedia is the place to set the record straight! 

Which brings me to a particular turd which appears in a few of these articles about football.  It is claimed in a few articles that, "[m]odern American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal, and Harvard University in 1874."  Its source is this [http://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/features/birth-3-sports claim] on the McGill website.  I was unable to find a similar claim on behalf of Harvard, but not surprisingly, I ''was'' able to find a claim on behalf of the [[Canadian football#History|University of Toronto]].

I won't deny that an innovation occurred at that game:  the McGill players introduced carrying the ball to the Harvard players.  But would anyone claim that the McGill players were the first to carry the ball in any type of football game?  If McGill were the first to do this, then why don't they get exclusive credit?  Some innovations occurred prior to this and many innovations, some [[History of American football#Walter Camp: Father of American football| much more significant]], occurred after this.  To take a frame out of the football-history "movie" and to claim that this frame represents ''the'' innovation that made the game "modern" is simplistic, and it doesn't take into account the fact that the rules of the game evolved over time, as opposed to being invented whole cloth.  (See [http://www.steelersuk.com/history/early%20football.html this page] for a more realistic approach).

Distorting facts, or placing facts out of context, or only including those facts which flatter your prejudices, or in this case your country, makes for poor articles but entertaining reading.  I can't even read an article about [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] without being fed an excruciatingly large amount of information about her success in a small and not very significant market.  (And look!  There's even a ''link'' to Canada, unlike even Japan!  ...woooooo, impressive). Wikipedia has become a Canadian [[cargo cult]].  Fashioning sentences, paragraphs, sections, and complete articles to summon the Plane of Significance and the Plane of Respectability seems to be an ongoing project of a large number of Canadian editors, and I '''sincerely''' thank them for never ceasing to bring a smile to my face. --[[User:Antigrandiose|<font color="black"><span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: ">A<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 7pt">ntigrandios<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 9pt">Ë]][[User talk:Antigrandiose|<font color="DimGray"><sup>Talk]]</sup></font>  21:33, 9 February 2012 (UTC)

I'm not suggesting it's a cabal, that would imply a conspiracy.  I'm suggesting that there are too many editors who seem to edit on behalf of Canada, rather than on behalf of clarity and accuracy.  I realize that this problem isn't limited to Canada, but promotional silliness on behalf of Canada is an endemic problem on Wikipedia.

At this time I have neither the time or inclination to remove this claim from this and the other articles where it appears.  It's a depressing example of how Wikipedia has progressed:  instead of  evolving to be an increasingly accurate reflection of the world, it is becoming a platform for those wish to chip away at accuracy, perspective, and truth, nugget by nugget, in order to flatter their own prejudices. --[[User:Antigrandiose|<font color="black"><span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: ">A<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 7pt">ntigrandios<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 9pt">Ë]][[User talk:Antigrandiose|<font color="DimGray"><sup>Talk]]</sup></font>  23:48, 11 February 2012 (UTC)

*I'm not Canadian, but the notion that McGill introduced rugby style football to the U.S. is fairly well represented in reliable literature.  See [http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf this article] pages 3-4, which describes the Harvard-McGill game in some detail.  I'm pretty sure [[David M. Nelson]] discusses the importance of the Harvard-McGill in ''The Anatomy of a Game'', I don't have a copy handy right now, but it's a fairly comprehensive work on the history of American Football.  While the source in this article is a bit shaky, reliable sources do exist, and the notion is fairly uncontroversial and commonly accepted among historians of American football.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 04:25, 12 February 2012 (UTC)

Please reread my third paragraph above.  I'm not sure that we're disagreeing on anything.  As stated, my objection is to taking a single innovation and claiming that it demarcates the boundary between primitive or early football and [[History of American football|"modern" football]].  (Scare quotes used because I would bet there is disagreement among experts as to which innovations and rule changes constitute the origins of the modern game).  Games played by Harvard ''years'' after the game played against McGill would be unrecognizable to even modern Canadian football fans, much less American ones.  Nineteenth century games with makeshift rules that differed from location to location were, as you mentioned, similar to Rugby.  It wouldn't be at all similar to what you see people in the NFL playing today.  This claim gives undue weight to a single innovation and is the equivalent of citing a randomly selected eighteenth century game of [[rounders]] as being the first game of "modern" baseball. --[[User:Antigrandiose|<font color="black"><span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: ">A<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 7pt">ntigrandios<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 9pt">Ë]][[User talk:Antigrandiose|<font color="DimGray"><sup>Talk]]</sup></font>  23:14, 12 February 2012 (UTC)

:I see nothing wrong with the statement, insofar as it is factually correct.  Modern football did grow out of those contests in a very direct fashion.  Modern humans grew out of [[Australopithecine]]s, though modern humans look distinctly different.  If "grew out of" is a problem, perhaps a term like "evolved" may imply more changes between the McGill-Harvard contest and the modern forms of American football.  But there is a direct and undisputed line between the McGill-Harvard games --> "Concessionary Rules" games between Yale & Harvard --> [[Walter Camp]] from Yale.  Check the sources I provided above.  That the game changed from the first McGill-Harvard games over the next few decades doesn't diminish the fact that the game was crucial in later devlopments.  Before its influence, the predominant form of football played in America was ''association'' football, or something darn close to it.  That was the game that all of the schools ''except'' Harvard preferred.  It left Harvard without anyone to play, which is why the scheduled the rugby match with McGill.  Most of the other schools playing football at the time were playing some variation of "kick a round ball in the goal" type games; the introduction of the "run the oblong ball across the line" game to the United States came directly from the McGill-Harvard contest.  It is quite correct to state that modern American football evolved in a direct line from the McGill-Harvard game.  McGill did not invent that style of game, but they certainly introduced it to the United States. --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 23:33, 12 February 2012 (UTC)

You seem to be arguing against the following proposition: Nothing of significance "grew out of" the Harvard/ McGill game of 1874.  That's an easy windmill to tilt, but it's not what I wrote.  Again, please reread my third paragraph above.  You differ from both your source and [http://www.steelersuk.com/history/early%20football.html mine] by seeming to argue that a single event or a single game somehow demarcates the line between early and modern football.  (Although I'm not quite sure that that's what you're arguing, you don't directly address my concerns and don't seem to be arguing against what I wrote).  I just reread the article that you cite, and I would argue that it supports my position more than it does your's.  It states that, "Some historians have gone so far as to call the Oneidas' victories the first games of American football, maintaining the hybrid Boston Game was neither soccer nor rugby and, therefore, was what Americans recognize as their favorite autumn sport."  The Oneidas were youngsters in Boston who played this game prior to Harvard/ McGill game.  It goes on to mention that Harvard's game, ''prior'' to McGill's "invention" of modern American football, was as follows:  "The emphasis seems to have been on kicking, but the ball could be caught and run if the catcher was pursued."  Obviously my earlier statement that "the McGill players introduced carrying the ball to the Harvard players" is incorrect. It seems that the McGill's rugby game simply introduced rule and scoring innovations to the Harvard game.  It was a step along the evolutionary ladder, but so was kicking a ball with your foot, and so was the line of scrimmage and the forward pass.  It seems pretty arbitrary to claim that this event was what modern American football "grew out of."

And SPEAKING of the evolutionary ladder, your example of Australopithecines relates to exactly the point I'm trying to make.  ''Australopithecus'' is one of our ancestors, but they didn't magically appear whole cloth, and there were species between them and us.  ''Australopithecus'' was an innovation on the way to modern humans, but it is both a [[Ardipithecus|descendant]] and an [[Homo heidelbergensis|ancestor]] of other equally important species.  It doesn't hold a privileged position in the evolutionary trajectory of our species.  Humans no more "grew out of" or "evolved" from them than we did from earlier or more recent examples of humans.  No one would mistake a bunch of Australopithecines for modern humans, even if they were running around with a ball and were playing something that vaguely resembled modern rugby.  (Also, and I just ''have'' to add this, if the Australopithecines were playing by the rules played in the Harvard/ McGill game, there wouldn't be a line of scrimmage or a forward pass).  Case Western Reserve University doesn't take credit for discovering [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|fossils of "modern" humans]], but McGill is making an analogous claim.  Modern American football is the result of many innovations in many different times and places, and by oversimplifying that, we loose a lot of the richness of its history. --[[User:Antigrandiose|<font color="black"><span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: ">A<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 7pt">ntigrandios<span style="font-family: Felix Titling; font-size: 9pt">Ë]][[User talk:Antigrandiose|<font color="DimGray"><sup>Talk]]</sup></font>  17:54, 13 February 2012 (UTC)

The establishment date for league in the oddly named "Football codes board" should be 1895, not 1875. And the league non-contact variant, touch football, should be a link to this page: [[Touch football (rugby_league)]]. In addition, Australian soccer's attempt at trolling by rebranding itself as football occurred in 2005, not 2007.
:OZ soccer date still wrong, still links to wrong version of touch footy.

The sources given include some links an they do not support the the unequivocal statement made in the sentence. Indeed if as one source suggests that only hand were used then what is that game doing in this article?

Whoever added this sentence (or retained it) though it necessary to qualify it with four citations. This shows that it is contentious. How do the authors know that these ancient games resembles rugby more than say Ausi-rules? If the were closer to rugby that American football do the sources have details of the ball having to be passed backwards? 

I think that the sentence should be removed as is a a synthesis of the sources. Indeed would probably be a good idea to remove most of the section they games mention have no links with the modern codes of football. -- [[User:PBS|PBS]] ([[User talk:PBS|talk]]) 10:52, 24 June 2013 (UTC)

Federation Football is the most widely played game around the world, not to be confused with Association Football which only a few limited countries still play(eg. America, Canada).  Federation Football is not Soccer, only Association Football is also named Soccer as the term Soccer comes from the word Assoc short for Association.

== Origins of football ==

"On July 15, 2004, Mr. Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, declared to the world on the Third China International Football Exposition that football was originated from China; thus Linzi in Zibo of Shandong Province was officially recognized as the birthplace of football." <ref>http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/</ref>

On 13 June 2008 FIFA are on record as declaring "...It was recently argued that a form of football, or "cuju", as it was named originated in the Shandong Province of Linzi during the West Han Dynasty. A primitive version of football existed in China centuries before it was modified and given rules by English scholars to become association football, as it is known today, in the mid-18th century." <ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20080613204411/http://www.fifa.com/womenolympic/destination/hostcountry/index.html</ref>. 

This claim has since been discredited. No evidence has ever been found to support an historical connection with the Association football the code of football administrated internationally by FIFA, any other modern code of football or any of the medieval football games played in Western Europe from which all modern codes evolved. FIFA have more recently played down their assertion now mealy claiming "scientific evidence" for Cuju being the oldest form of the game on their website. This is despite the Ancient Greek game of Episkyros referred to on this page recognised as an early form if football by FIFA being verifiably older! <ref>http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html</ref><ref>http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=2026693/index.html</ref>  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Adrian Roebuck|Adrian Roebuck]] ([[User talk:Adrian Roebuck|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adrian Roebuck|contribs]]) 13:06, 22 August 2013 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Articles about each code would, of course, be titled the full name and would use an unmodified "football" for all later references to that game on that page.--[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 16:58, 23 March 2015 (UTC)
Busy can test the waters - the [[Manchester United F.C.]] has no mention in the prose about what type of football the club plays, it must be inferred from other elements of the page. If introducing in a soccer or association football in the lead sticks, the world beckons.

The various codes of football share certain common elements. Players in American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league take-up positions in a limited area of the field at the start of the game. They tend to use throwing and running as the main ways of moving the ball, and only kick on certain limited occasions. Body tackling is a major skill, and games typically involve short passages of play of 5–90 seconds. Association football, Australian rules football and Gaelic football tend to use kicking to move the ball around the pitch, with handling more limited. Body tackles are less central to the game, and players are freer to move around the field (offside laws are typically less strict).  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/197.2.95.182|197.2.95.182]] ([[User talk:197.2.95.182|talk]]) 14:52, 19 August 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

{{edit semi-protected|Football|answered=yes}}
If possible, I would hope that a few more facts can be added on the history of football in China, and a possible correction. The sources such as Zhanguoce (战国策）clearly indicate that already during the period of Warring States playing Cuju or Taju, a leather ball filled with feathers, was a common pass-time for people of Qi, one of the seven major kingdoms striving for supremacy at that time. A later source, "别录" (Other Records) makes a reference to a lost text where the invention of Cuju is attributed to Huangdi, the forefather of Chinese civilization. Naturally, it could be as well a legend, nevertheless, it must be noted that a common use of football in China definitely predates the Han Dynasty (contrary to what the article states) as the period of Warring States predates Han. Han Dynasty comes after the collapse of Qin Shi Huang, and the emergence of Qin as a supreme political and military power which unifies all conflicted kingdoms practically ends the era of the Warring States.
