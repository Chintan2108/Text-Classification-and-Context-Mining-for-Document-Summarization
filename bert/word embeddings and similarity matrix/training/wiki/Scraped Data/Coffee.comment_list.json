If I can add a bit (perhaps useful for the page, perhaps not)\n\n-The coffee genus grows wild in the rain forests of tropical Africa but not further north. Coffea arabica is a natural hybrid, with as most likely parents probably C. eugenioides (from the highlands of Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya) and  C. canephora. The hybrid originates from southwest Ethiopia or neighbouring Sudan. The evidence that cultivation began in this region is indirect only: southwest Ethiopia is one of eight regions in the world where agriculture was independently developed, and is the origin of crops such as ensete. From here coffee spread to Harar in Ethiopia, and to Yemen. \n\n-The older certified reference to coffee is from the mid 1400 by which time it was well established as a drink in Yemen, and widely grown. But when this first started is not known. The intricate ceremony attached to drinking in Ethiopia, and the close relation between 'Kaffa' (the old name for the region in southwest Ethiopia) and the Arab word for coffee, make it plausible but not proven that coffee was consumed here first. In any case, it is difficult to see the plant spreading north in regions where it does not grow naturally if it was not used locally. \n\n-In the Kaffa language, the coffee plant is called 'bunno'. Elsewhere in Ethiopia the different languages use a very similar word. The same word is used in two 9th century manuscripts, and it is probable that the crop existed and had spread by that time, but  whether it was eaten or drunk is not known. E.g. see J. Crawford, 1852, History of Coffee, Journal of the Statistical Society of London, Volume 15, p. 50, and the note added by Dr. Beke on p. 57, which may be the source for many of the later discussions.\n\n","user":"ABZebra"},{"date":"2016-04-20T18:35:00Z","id":2,"parent_id":1,"section":"Origin of coffee","text":"I feel it's just racism.  —Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Resourcer1|Resourcer1]] ([[User talk:Resourcer1|talk]] •","user":"Resourcer1"},{"date":"2016-04-21T03:59:00Z","id":3,"parent_id":2,"section":"Origin of coffee","text":"{{ping|ABZebra}} I wasnt aware Kaffa has its own language. {{ping|Resourcer1}} This is not considered proper discussion.","user":"Zekenyan"},{"date":"2016-05-10T14:50:00Z","id":4,"parent_id":3,"section":"Origin of coffee","text":"Qahwa is the Arabic word and it has a meaning, it was (and can still be) used for all kinds of beverages that could alter your state, including intoxicants.

A relation to 'khat' has been sugested, or the word 'quwwah' (arabic for 'strength') has also been suggested as the origin of the word 'coffee' (ref: Weinberg & Bealer).  The Ethiopian area Kaffa has been suggested to be the origin of the word, but Kaye (ref Kaye) argues that the arabic word is not related to this. Kaye doea argue for a relation to the semitic word 'qhh' (meaning 'dark'). The article should  mention that in the Gunga language of the Kaffe area in Ethiopia, where the plant grows in the wild, the word 'bunno' or variations thereof are used for the plant and bean, and this is used in many other Ethiopian languages. Ref: J. Crawford, 1852, History of Coffee, Journal of the Statistical Society of London, Volume 15, p. 50, and the note added by Dr. Beke on p. 57,\n\n'Legendary accounts'  I would remove the words \"though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century.[6]\" which is out of place in a section on mythology, and is not in the stated reference [6] (who does argue for an older but undated ethiopian origin).  \n\n'Historical transmission' (funny title for the subsection but I get the point). \nAdd  'The oldest still existing document (in  a later Latin translation) believed to refer to coffee is Avicenna (aka Ibn Sina), the canon of medicin, approximately 1000AD, where the word 'bunchum' is used. It may refer to an even older but lost document by Rhazes, around 900AD, called 'The continent', where 'bunn' is used for the plant and 'bunchum' for a drink derived from the plant. (ref Weinberg and Bealer, above)\n\nIn the pre-amble at the top of the page, it says \"the plant is native to subtropical Africa and some islands in southern Asia.[2]\": It is tropical not subtropical, and the islands are Comoros, Madagascar, and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, not southern Asia.

What coffee does that caffeine on its own doesn't is, inter alia, to affect part of the human hormonal system; the 'day/night' regulator mechanism.\n\nAlso, there seems to be no mention so far of the crucial effect of temperature on the brew. In order to maximise the proportion of 'nice' exctracts the temperature should, according to Dr Johnson's preferences, not exceed 95 degrees C. An alternative extraction process, the expresso method, uses higher temperature but a very short extraction time. At higher temperature and with longer extraction times the proportions of bitter, 'jangly' as I experience them, constituents increases. It's easy to test this. Either make two brews using boiling and slightly cooled water, OR use just the first portion through the expresso machine and on a different occasion the later portions. \n\nGiven that this coffee stuff provides a variety of drugs, one might as well get the best out of it.

It would be useful to have information on the known consitutents and on how to maximise the desired effects while minimising any disadvantages.

Yes, you will see it mentioned nearly everywhere, but if you take the time to trace it to a <s>primary</s> secondary source (which is, in itself, nearly impossible), you will find the only time that this may have been true was in 1986.  Someone cited that data in a book, and it was such an exciting number to coffee folks that they ran with it and never looked back (or checked to see if it was still true 10, 15 or 20 years later).  Now it is more or less accepted as common knowledge—except that since then, coffee has fallen behind other agricultural products in value, which you can verify by using the UN Food And Agriculture database for export values (compare coffee, for example, to wheat, maize, soybean, sugar, and palm oil over the last 10 years).  This is an old myth that needs to be put to rest.

It's not value, also, the statistic is \"the most traded commodity,\" not \"the most valuable commodity.\"  Coffee was never the msot or second most or even in the top ten of valuable commodities that I've ever seen.

The databases can be found here: http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx.  At that time, the most current data they had was from 2003, when coffee was the sixth largest agricultural commodity (measured by value of exports), after wheat, soybeans, maize, sugar and palm oil.   The database does not list commodities such as oil, precious metals, etc.  I don't have a list of the \"most traded commodities or the placement of coffee in the most traded commodities list.\"  What I can tell you is that, if coffee is only the sixth-largest agricultural commodity, then it is certainly not the second largest commodity overall!  Also, the position of coffee changes every year: in 1986, it was, in fact, the number one agricultural commodity, and in 3 years in the 1990's it was second, after wheat.  To say \"coffee is\" when talking talking about highly volatile commodity markets risks having the statement be nearly immediately out-of-date.  Whenever I see the \"second-most\" whatever (the \"whatever\" changes from source to source: some say \"traded,\" some say \"valuable,\" some just say \"important,\" whatever that means-- and this is true even of peer-reviewed articles), in the rare cases when I have been able to trace it back to a <s>primary</s> secondary source, the <s>primary</s> secondary source is always from the late 1980's.  For example, Talbot (Grounds for Agreement, published in 2004) cited data from 1988.  So it is possible that, in 1986 when coffee was the top agricultural commodity in terms of total export value, it was also the second commodity overall.  I haven't been able to verify this, as I haven't been able to go back to the couple of cited <s>primary</s> secondary sources to check that they really say what the people who cite them say they do.  On the other hand, if you are talking about total volume of contracts sold (as opposed to value), the situation could be different.  This, of course, has as much to do with the level of speculation in the different commodity markets than with the real value of the product, or even the trade in the product.  It seems dubious that, as we are coming off a highly speculative bull market in precious metals and other non-agrocultural commodities, coffee would even come in second by this definition  A New York Times article earlier this year said that coffee had the second-highest trading volume, in terms of contracts (by which a single quantity of coffee can be bought and sold many times) on the New York agricultural exchange, after sugar.  Of course coffee is also traded on other exchanges, and may trump sugar--and all the other agricultural commodites--in those places. If you know of a good source for the total value of contracts sold worldwide for all commodities, I would love to see it.  In fact, I would love, love, love for someone to take the time to do a real analysis, using current data, of where coffee fits in global trade by the several definitions available.  Unfortunately, I don't have time to do this myself.   In the meantime, my point remains: the oft-cited \"second-most\" figure simply cannot be verified, except, possibly, pertaining to some time many years ago, but in many cases there is strong evidence, if not proof, that it is no longer true.","user":"Margareta"},{"date":"2006-11-07T22:55:00Z","id":206,"parent_id":205,"section":"\"Second most traded commodity after oil\" is unverified and not supported by available data","text":"\"Traded\" is not synonymous with valuable.

Commodities trading is about locking in the price, for agricultural products, isn't it, say on how much coffee you want next month and how much you are willing to pay for it?  While the market for coffee has grown immensely over the past two decades, things like the glut of cheap Vietnamese Robustas have caused the price to go down.  So, over twenty years the volume of coffee is much greater, but the price may have dropped due to the market being overstocked with cheap coffees.  So, are buyers more worried about the price of coffee, meaning the its share in the commodities trading market is more?  Or is amount of commodities trading solely a reflection of price, in which case it seems as if it never could have been the second most traded commodity as there are lots of other agricultural goods that have a significantly larger share of the market, like needed items, say rice?\n\n:::If it's only the value, then the article should just say value, but it doesn't say that.

But you are right, it is not about that book, as this is a phrase that is tossed around a lot in many places - whether they say \"most traded,\" \"most valuable,\" or \"most important.\"  Wild is no better and no worse than any other author (although better referencing would have made his book much more useful).  Your confusion demonstrates exactly the problem, and this is what I am trying to get you to understand.  You appear to be fixated on this one point, the definition of \"most traded\" and proving that coffee is not the \"second most traded\"--universally, all the time.  First understand that in books, scientific literature, press releases, reports and on the internet, \"most traded\" is used interchangeably with \"most valuable\" and \"most important.\"  You can verify this for yourself.  This alone should indicate that something is not right.  \"Most traded\" as a phrase has absolutely no meaning in and of itself, and yet people keep tossing around this \"fact\" as though it was in some way verifiable.  You say that \"most traded\" does not have to do with export values.  Quoting: \"In this case trade is in bags, in another its in tonnes, and you think it is in dolllars.\"  In fact, it's both--people pay dollars (or Euros) for bags of coffee.  Regardless of which exchange it's sold on, or what unit it's sold in, it is sold for currency.  If you want to compare trade in different products using bags of coffee as your measure, then the discussion becomes meaningless, because we can't compare different products in any other terms besides value.  You can't compare trade in bags of coffee, for example, to barrels of crude oil or ounces of gold.  Trade is measured in value.  We have to be clear on that or there is really no discussion to be had.\n\nI can also tell you that I have spent a great deal of time tracing back the many permutations of the \"second most\" statements to the <s>primary</s> secondary sources, and--when there are primary sources--it is always total export value that is listed in the <s>primary</s> secondary source, not contracts or some other measure (for example, nearly all U.S. mentions of this statistic can be traced back to is a CIA fact book from the late 1980's, which talks about export values).  If the statistic has changed from \"most valuable\" to \"most traded\" over the years, that just underscores how careless authors have become in checking their sources and expressing information accurately.  I do admit that I fell prey to this confusion as well in the way I titled this thread, and I have changed that, and I have a note below about how the Wiki might be changed to be more accurate.\n\nI have already provided you with my source - the UN Food and Agriculture Organization - for data on the actual value of agricultural products sold.  Since coffee is below second in those rankings, then it follows that it is below second in the rankings of all commodities (agricultural and non-agricultural), regardless of what non-agricultural commodites may have a higher total value than the top agricultural commodity (wheat).  I don't have to know what the first and second commodities are--and I don't--to prove that coffee isn't second.  From the FAO I know that, at minimum, coffee is below wheat, soybeans, maize, palm oil, and sugar.  I.e., not second.  It also changes places nearly every year.\n\nIf you think there is some other definition of \"most traded,\" please tell me what it is and we can go from there.  It is also possible to define it in terms of contracts traded, but this has more to do with speculation than it has bearing on the real importance of coffee trade, and this is not how most authors have been defining it.\n\nI'm not using Google searches to prove that something's not true.  I used them to demonstrate how far this myth has spread, and how easy it is for a writer to find something to cite--even something that seems pretty official.  I have plenty of examples of peer-reviewed journal articles that say the same thing about coffee - and still confuse the terminology.  Wild almost certainly used one of these articles for the reference in his book (though we will never know).  And I have traced the citations in these articles to the <s>primary</s> secondary sources, and the sources are all fifteen or more years old.  I have asked researchers where they got their numbers, and they always give me sources that are either outdated themselves, or that cite sources that are.  So what I can say with confidence is this:  the people who are giving this number are not verifying their facts, and the market has changed dramatically since this statistic was first published.  It is too easy to accept something as common knowledge and repeat it, without taking the time to check.\n\nMeanwhile, what is to be done about the Wiki page?  I didn't write the phrase \"second most commonly traded commodity in the world,\" someone else did (which is why I titled thhe thread the way I did), but I changed some of the wording around it to show that it was not longer true.  But KP Botany is right, the wording is very confusing as \"second most commonly traded\" is not defined.  I am inclined to say it would be better to just delete the two sentences starting with \"In some years in the 1980's. . .\" leaving in the part about coffee being the seventh most valuable agricultural export in 2003.  I wanted to leave in the part about the \"second most\" not being true, because this is such a persistent myth, but prehaps the top paragraph is not the best place for this (though that was where the original sentence was).  I will also check Portillo (ref #4) tomorrow to see exactly what measurement he is referring to.  I am pretty sure it is actually export value.  If that is the case, it will be really easy to just change the sentence from \"second most commonly traded commodity in the world (measured by monetary volume)\" to \"second most valuable export commodity.\"\n\nBy the way, KP Botany, just so you know in 1986, according to the FAO data, coffee actually WAS the #1 agricultural export crop in terms of value--above rice, wheat, soy and all the other big ones.  In 1987, 1994-95, and 1997-2000 it was second--just below wheat (but still not second to oil!).  My hypothesis is actualy that 1986 is where the original quotation came from.  I can't verify this, because I don't know what non-agricultural commodities may have been above coffee.","user":"Margareta"},{"date":"2006-11-09T19:12:00Z","id":212,"parent_id":211,"section":"\"Second most traded commodity after oil\" is unverified and not supported by available data","text":"This post obfuscates rather clarifies what you meant, and, essentially you're saying you can't and won't prove or establish what it is you mean, but you will resort to [[Ad hominem|ad hominem]] attacks of anyone who asks for sources.  \n\n:::Or, in other words, \"Coffee IS the second most traded commodity after oil.\"  I got it.","user":"KP Botany"},{"date":"2006-11-09T19:35:00Z","id":213,"parent_id":0,"section":"\"Second most traded commodity after oil\" is unverified and not supported by available data","text":"Um...  wow.

However, I just went back to the Trade Statistics page ([http://faostat.fao.org/site/342/default.aspx]), and fortunately the FAO is now publishing selected statistics in tables (they weren't when I originally looked this up).  Until someone else provides an alternate one, I am taking as the definition of \"most traded\" the total value of exports worldwide.  Therefore:\n\nFrom Table C.16 (http://www.fao.org/es/ess/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c16.pdf):\n      Wheat $15.5 billion dollars\nFrom Table C.19 (http://www.fao.org/es/ess/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c19.pdf):\n      Sugar $10.0 billion dollars\n      Coffee $6.5 billion dollars\n\nThus, regardless of what other commodities not listed in these tables may be above or between coffee, wheat, or sugar, coffee--being third in this list--cannot be second overall.\n\nIf you think there is another definition of trade that should be used, please provide it.

You can see that, besides the fact that the source actually talked about \"most valuable,\" not \"most traded,\" it also qualified the statement by saying \"in many years,\" whereas the editor who cited it made the statement unqualified, and the \"second to\" clause only refers to developing countries, whereas the editor made the statement all-inclusive.","user":"Margareta"},{"date":"2006-11-09T22:57:00Z","id":216,"parent_id":215,"section":"\"Second most traded commodity after oil\" is unverified and not supported by available data","text":"It seems we are not the first to discuss this.

In the preparation section, black should either be A. disambiguated if some article or page makes mention of the word's meaning in a coffee context or B. given some parenthetical or other expression of its connotation of  \"with no additives\". Or better yet, just begin with the simple definition and then say, \"also colloquially known as \"black\"\". {{done}}\n* The sentence \"Coffee has played a role in many societies throughout history\" needs clarification. What kind of role? Anything that has existed has played some sort of role in history. At least try and assert the importance of the subject with an adjective like notable or important.{{done}} (changed to \"important\") {{done}}\n* The last paragraph in the intro, about health effects, needs some grammar work, it's a bit cyclical. Saying its health effects has been questioned is a little bit off, it should probably say  controversial. {{done}}\n* This sentence: \"Physically, the bean shrinks in weight the beans are heated and moisture is lost\" needs punctuation I believe. {{done}}\n* The paragraph on the ecological impact of coffee-growing currently in the economics section needs to go in the cultivation section. I strongly suggest that instead of the pretty, but slightly pointless, close-up of the Brazilian plant in the Biology section, this image {{Image:Coffee Flowers Show.jpg}} of mono-cropped coffee be used to replace it.

Better to name a particular credible historian.{{done}}\n* Again in the history section, a general citation for most of the American history is fine, but the opinion that coffee was thought to be a \"generally poor substitute for tea.\" needs to be directly cited. Anytime you assert the general tastes of a historical population of people there should be attribution.{{done}}\n:3. Broad in coverage?: [[Image:Symbol wait.svg|15px]] Yes, but some expansion of the free trade movement is necessary. Simpy saying what it is, and when it started is insufficient.

The reason - not the headaches, not the fatigue but the accompanying profound depression and constipation.\n\nCoffee helps people to eat a diet that may not agree with them. It doesn't allow proper feedback to come from the food. Many people after eating wheat and dairy get fatigued but this effect is blocked or at least changed by the consumption of coffee or caffeine. The fatigue effect is a warming that food is not proper for the person. Instead of registering that effect, people cover it with a stress hormone drink like coffee, injuring themselves with the food and with the coffee in the long run.\n\nI've heard studies about people over 40 that can increase their mental clarity and memory with some amounts of coffee.

'Ethiopians' is a (a)generic term for a modern nation's varied population, constituted of different ethnic groups but (b) it is an historic term going back to antiquity, rooted in mythological cosmology, and was used later to refer to the Nubians. The Nubians speak a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language, while Oromo is [[Cushitic]]. So throughout antiquity the 'Ethiopians' were mythical, or 'Nubians', then later the the [[Amhara]] who spoke a language from a third linguistic group ([[south Semitic]]). The RS implied that the Oromo were the people that until recent centuries, Western or classical sources on Ethiopians understood to be what we now call either Nubians or the Amharic peoples of Ethiopia.\n:::That is why I re-edited according to the source quoted, altering it to remove this slippery and dangerous equivocation. Unfortunately (and my insistence on this in the past has occasionally gotten me into hot water by editors who refuse to understand the difficulty) often very good sources get things wrong, or phrase things badly when the scholars writing them draw on material outside their specific area of competence, and this has happened here. While a wiki editor is not supposed to note when a RS gets things wrong, or uses misleading phraseology, at the same time, an editor who cares for the quality of his text should exercise commonsense and close judgement, by not following verbatim an RS that slips up (the endless argument I was compelled to make on using Walter Laqueur on the Qur'an: Laqueur is RS, but he got things drastically wrong on a point of textual citation). So, good judgement, not, as often asserted even by fine editors, [[WP:OR]], requires one not to cite him on that point, etc).\n:::To repeat what the RS says is to endorse an ideology, against the known facts of African history and ethnography,  that one modern and major ethnic group, the Oromo, constitute the essence or heart of Ethiopian culture, and tradition, as opposed to the other populations which, by this slipshod use of language, are made out to be 'intruders' without the same long historical roots in that country.\n:::If there were an Oromo nationalist editing this page, he could theoretically challenge me and take me to arbitration for [[WP:OR]] violations in refusing to use those words verbatim. He would have a technical point in his favour, in insisting the exact words of the RS be repeated. But, while winning the point according to the rules, he would be using the rules to justify the retention of a carelessly phrased remark in an RS which, as it stands, legitimates an  implication that supports an ideology, that the Oromo are the real Ethiopians, and others secondary.\n:::I've used this to illustrate a point that I haven't found addressed in general editing. Discretionary intelligence in the use of first class sources is often necessary to avoid a deeper violation, of [[WP:NPOV]].

If the reason for the divine proscription on khamr was found to be in its intoxicating properties, then the prohibition might be extended, by application of qiyā, to other intoxicants. This was exactly the approach that some jurists took, arguing that any intoxicant was forbidden by analogy with khamr.</blockquote>\n:::<blockquote>The jurists gathered in Mecca in 1511 were apparently open to such an argument: if coffee could be shown to be intoxicating, it must be forbidden. They were aided by a linguistic peculiarity. The word qahwa, used for coffee, was also one of the words used for wine. In the end their final decision did not rest on a systematic argument linking coffee and wine. There were others willing to take up such a position, however. The argument for prohibition of coffee by analogy with wine must have had proponents, since defenders of coffee offered vigorous refutations. The reasoning adopted by the Meccan council of [[ulama|‘ulamā’]] turned out to be more pallid. Coffee was prohibited simply because it is vaguely harmful to one’s well-being.</blockquote>\n:::<blockquote>Although the assembled jurists of Mecca had reached their verdict, however, that was hardly the end of the matter. Anti-coffee jurists very soon had to face the inconvenient fact that other jurists, and as it turned out, more influential ones, disagreed with their decision. What the Meccan jurists had arrived at, in other words, was not God’s law in an objective sense, but simply their own understanding of God’s law. No Muslim jurist would doubt that God had an opinion about coffee, but most of them shared a healthy sense of their own fallibility in understanding his opinions. They could only do their best, and their best might not be enough. This process of seeking to understand God’s law the legal scholars called [[fiqh]] – understanding. Scholars who engaged in this process were fuqahā’. Fiqh and the rulings that resulted from it were, at best, an approximation of the true law of God, and the pro-coffee lobby was free to argue that the assembled Meccan ‘ulamā’ had gotten it quite wrong.’ Daniel W. Brown,A new introduction to Islam, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004 pp.119-120</blockquote>\n\n::Just as a piece of trivia, finally, re the Oromo and coffee. Until recently it was customary for the Oromo to plant a coffee tree on the graves of particularly powerful sorcerers. They say that the first coffee bush sprang up from the tears that the god of heaven shed over the corpse of a dead sorcerer.\n::This is mentioned by a source your page uses, i.e. Stewart Lee Allen,The devil's cup: coffee, the driving force in history, Soho, 1999 pp.27ff.

First off, citing one study out of probably hundreds done on SDA groups as evidence of coffee being harmful is spurious. What about the other studies done on the SDA? To not note that the other studious found no correlation is intellectually dishonest and misleading. It should have been qualified with, \"But only one study...\" If it takes only one study to to make the inclusion of the information within into an article valid, every wikipedia page would be filled with paragraph after paragraph of frivolous info. I'm sure there is a single study that claims chewing gum causes global warming or something as equally as frivolous. Does that mean that particular info should be included into the article about gum? Second, even if the Adventists observed refrained from alcohol and smoking (and how can you even know that for sure, they could be fibbing about that so as to not get into trouble) there are still many, many confounding factors. For example there is age, genetics, sex, race, diet, exercise and many, many more. To imply that SDA church members somehow constitute a \"pure\" sample and \"completely free\" from confounding factors just because they abstain from smoking and drinking is incredibly fallacious. Also, if they refrain from smoking and drinking, how can we know for sure that it's not those factors that contribute to them being supposedly healthier? The study just could have easily concluded that there is a \"weak but statistically significant association\" (more on that dubious phrase later) between alcohol intake or tobacco intake and \"mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all causes of death.\" Also, \"all causes of death????\" That's incredibly clunky phrasing, what does coffee intake have to with causes of death like being drowned, falling from a height, being electrocuted, being stabbed to death and the like? And do we need to say \"all cardiovascular diseases combined\" and \"other cardiovascular disease?\" Isn't that redundant? Not to mention vague as hell.\n\nAlso, the language and use of words is troubling. The study is described as \"being able to show,\" this is very NPOV. Unless you are God and know for sure that study is 100% accurate, the best you can say is that the study \"claims\" to show. Studies are based on subjective human observation and conclusions, and can't be taken as gospel. \"Being able to show\" is absurdly over authoritative. Second, the phrase \"weak but statistically significant association\" is pure double talk. How can it be weak and also at the same time \"statistically significant\"? One precludes the other. That's like saying \"that man is weak, but strong!\" It makes no sense. It seems to me their is an agenda here, namely to try and saddle coffee as being bad for your health. If you're going to do that, fine, there are many views on that issue, but I cry foul when one very shaky and dubious study is used to further that claim.\n\nP.S. I'm not implying Rexss that you intentionally are trying to push an anti-coffee message, but your re-write sure didn't help.  —Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by","user":"68.205.59.37"},{"date":"2010-07-31T12:18:00Z","id":450,"parent_id":449,"section":"Misleading Prohibition Statistics for the Seventh-day Adventist Church","text":"That's ok - no offence taken; I'm just disappointed that I wasn't able to make a better job of writing for you. Let's see if we can identify your concerns, then see how we can address them:\n:*You feel that citing \"Coffee consumption and mortality in Seventh-Day Adventists\" out of hundreds done on SDA groups is spurious. Perhaps you could suggest some of those other studies that would be worth including. I usually find the solution is consider more sources to provide balance and I'd be happy to do so.\n:*You raise the problem of confounding factors, but wouldn't you agree that taking into account the factors you suggest is a well understood statistical technique? As long as your sample contains significant numbers of examples of each, then any such effect can be estimated. For example, if the sample contains roughly equal numbers of men and women, then analysis can estimate the magnitude of effect that gender has on mortality from ischemic heart disease. The problem is that smoking in particular has a huge effect and is likely to swamp any weak effect (more on that later). Finding a population (SDA) that is virtually free of the effects of tobacco – as a matter of choice, not necessity – is what makes this study so sensitive, and allows it to examine factors which would be lost in the statistical noise that tobacco causes. This study is a 25-year follow-up with a sample size close to ten thousand on a population free of the principal confounding factor. I think that gives it sufficient credentials to distinguish it from many other studies looking at factors affecting ischemic heart disease.\n:*You find the quote from the study clunky. Well yes, it does read awkwardly and I'd be happy to see a better formulation. The study concluded that they could show four associations: (coffee consumption – mortality from ischemic heart disease); (coffee consumption – mortality from other cardiovascular disease); (coffee consumption – mortality from all cardiovascular diseases combined); (coffee consumption – all causes of death). That's a statistical association, not a demonstration of causality, so it is certainly does not imply that drinking coffee causes people to be stabbed to death.\n:*I'd be happy to find a better phrase than \"was able to show\", but the point is that this study was capable of showing an association, because it eliminated the principal confounding factors.\n:*I'm sorry but I have to simply dismiss your concerns that the study subjects might have been lying, or that smoking is good for your health.\n:*Finally the phrase \"weak but statistically significant association\" is perfectly reasonable. What it is saying is that people who drink coffee have a very slightly higher empirical chance of death in a particular period than those that don't consume (a weak association); and that the study researchers are quite confident about the result (a statistically significant association). Perhaps it needs to be explained in full, but I'm not sure how much more space should be devoted to attempting to explain statistics in a page about coffee. --","user":"RexxS"},{"date":"2010-06-19T04:54:00Z","id":451,"parent_id":0,"section":"Mixing coffee with alcohol","text":"\"Coffee can also be incorporated with alcohol in beverages\"  Why would anyone want to [[Mixing of stimulants and depressants|mix uppers with downers]] like that? <B>[[User:Tisane|Tisane]]</B> [[User talk:Tisane|talk]]/","user":"Tisane"},{"date":"2010-06-19T07:42:00Z","id":452,"parent_id":451,"section":"Mixing coffee with alcohol","text":"Mebbe they just like the taste.

I think the point that there is evidence (it is evidence, isn't it, not just a traditional legend?) that the Oromo mixed roasted coffee beans with butter and fat is helpful, but I think you need to make a better argument that that really was the beginning of the drink \"coffee\". You might compare this with the fact that the Aztecs drank a brew of cacao beans without sugar. When Europeans got the cacao beans, they created a drink with sugar. Do we say the Aztecs drank hot chocolate? I don't know, but I don't think so, and I think there are very few people today who would drink a brew of ground-up cacao beans without sugar. So I think most people would say that Europeans invented hot chocolate. \n\nYou all sound like intelligent people to me.
