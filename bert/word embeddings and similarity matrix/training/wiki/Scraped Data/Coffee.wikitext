== Origin of coffee ==

I saw the discussions here on the origin of coffee. If I can add a bit (perhaps useful for the page, perhaps not)

-The coffee genus grows wild in the rain forests of tropical Africa but not further north. Coffea arabica is a natural hybrid, with as most likely parents probably C. eugenioides (from the highlands of Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya) and  C. canephora. The hybrid originates from southwest Ethiopia or neighbouring Sudan. The evidence that cultivation began in this region is indirect only: southwest Ethiopia is one of eight regions in the world where agriculture was independently developed, and is the origin of crops such as ensete. From here coffee spread to Harar in Ethiopia, and to Yemen. 

-The older certified reference to coffee is from the mid 1400 by which time it was well established as a drink in Yemen, and widely grown. But when this first started is not known. The intricate ceremony attached to drinking in Ethiopia, and the close relation between 'Kaffa' (the old name for the region in southwest Ethiopia) and the Arab word for coffee, make it plausible but not proven that coffee was consumed here first. In any case, it is difficult to see the plant spreading north in regions where it does not grow naturally if it was not used locally. 

-In the Kaffa language, the coffee plant is called 'bunno'. Elsewhere in Ethiopia the different languages use a very similar word. The same word is used in two 9th century manuscripts, and it is probable that the crop existed and had spread by that time, but  whether it was eaten or drunk is not known. E.g. see J. Crawford, 1852, History of Coffee, Journal of the Statistical Society of London, Volume 15, p. 50, and the note added by Dr. Beke on p. 57, which may be the source for many of the later discussions.

Ethiopia has 77 official languages. Kaffa is a north-oromitic language (or language division), also called Gonga. There are several wikipedia pages on this topic. The word bunn is used for the plant and the bean, and is also used in the oldest arabic writing believed to relate to coffee, Avicenna 'The canon of medicin' [[User:ABZebra|ABZebra]] ([[User talk:ABZebra|talk]]) 09:46, 21 April 2016 (UTC)

I would make some suggestions for changes to the wikipedia article

'Etymology' The two main references should be: The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug,  Bennett Weinberg and Bonnie Bealer, Routledge 2001 (they provide a balanced discussion of the origin of the word), and The Etymology of "Coffee": The Dark Brew, Alan Kaye, Journal of the American Oriental Society 106 (3):557-558 (1986) . A relation to 'khat' has been sugested, or the word 'quwwah' (arabic for 'strength') has also been suggested as the origin of the word 'coffee' (ref: Weinberg & Bealer).  The Ethiopian area Kaffa has been suggested to be the origin of the word, but Kaye (ref Kaye) argues that the arabic word is not related to this. Kaye doea argue for a relation to the semitic word 'qhh' (meaning 'dark'). The article should  mention that in the Gunga language of the Kaffe area in Ethiopia, where the plant grows in the wild, the word 'bunno' or variations thereof are used for the plant and bean, and this is used in many other Ethiopian languages. Ref: J. Crawford, 1852, History of Coffee, Journal of the Statistical Society of London, Volume 15, p. 50, and the note added by Dr. Beke on p. 57,

'Legendary accounts'  I would remove the words "though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century.[6]" which is out of place in a section on mythology, and is not in the stated reference [6] (who does argue for an older but undated ethiopian origin).  

'Historical transmission' (funny title for the subsection but I get the point). 
Add  'The oldest still existing document (in  a later Latin translation) believed to refer to coffee is Avicenna (aka Ibn Sina), the canon of medicin, approximately 1000AD, where the word 'bunchum' is used. It may refer to an even older but lost document by Rhazes, around 900AD, called 'The continent', where 'bunn' is used for the plant and 'bunchum' for a drink derived from the plant. (ref Weinberg and Bealer, above)

In the pre-amble at the top of the page, it says "the plant is native to subtropical Africa and some islands in southern Asia.[2]": It is tropical not subtropical, and the islands are Comoros, Madagascar, and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, not southern Asia. I alos recommend to change the reference, perhaps to http://www.volcanocafe.org/volcano-coffee/ (but others could be found), as the ref [2] contains a number of factual errors.

== Effects of roasting on caffeine content ==

The following two lines seem to contradict one another.  Which is correct?

"Roasting is the last step of processing the beans in their intact state. During this last treatment, while still in the bean state, more caffeine breaks down above 235 °C. Dark roasting is the utmost step in bean processing removing the most caffeine."

"The degree of roast has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are generally bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times.[90] Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting."

== Coffee in Haiti (Saint-Domingue) ==

Pendergrast says 1734, Ukers, William H. (1922). in ''All About Coffee'' (The Tea and Coffee trade Journal Company), says coffee entered Haiti and Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) in 1715 and the variety of Gabriel de Clieu, who had taken his plant to Martinique and was later taken to Haiti (Saint-Domingue), presumably around this time of 1734? Which is correct? Can we investigate this further? [[User:Savvyjack23|Savvyjack23]] ([[User talk:Savvyjack23|talk]]) 01:04, 4 May 2017 (UTC)

::The article on [[Gabriel de Clieu]] ilustrates this point well. [[User:Savvyjack23|Savvyjack23]] ([[User talk:Savvyjack23|talk]]) 01:26, 4 May 2017 (UTC)

:::According to Clieu's account in the ''Année littéraire'' of 1774, cultivation in Haiti started in 1725. In 1729, the importation of coffee into mainland France was prohibited to protect the [[French East India Company]]. This embargo was then lifted in 1735, around the same time that Pendergrast has stated that the ''first'' cultivation happened in Saint-Domingue [he uses "San Domingo" (Haiti)]. Although, others state that Haiti and Surinam already began coffee cultivation in 1715 and 1718 respectively. (Cochet, Jean-Benoît-Désiré (1862). Galerie dieppoise: notices biographiques sur les hommes célèbres ou utiles; Henri Welter, Essai sur l'histoire du café, Paris, 1868) The Pan America Union states that the variety from Martinique was introduced and further cultivated in Haiti after 1715. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvYaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false] 

:::Pendergrast ''does'' however state that Clieu was ''not'' the first to introduce coffee to the region, that was the Dutch. So it is doubtful, according to the same sources that agree, that Haiti would first cultivate its plant much later in 1734. I don't think that is a credible statement.

== Just a BREWED drink ? ==

Especially in the UK, appears instant coffee to be very popular. And in northern Scandinavia is boiled coffee still very common. The beans are roasted, but are then put intact down in a boiling kettle for a few minutes, and is then served. And Italians, would I argue, use steamed very strong, so called Espresso as base for all other versions of their coffee, Cappuccino and Latte etc. Hence there are at least five ways of making coffee -

# brewed
# instant (boiled water with powder that dissolves in hot water)
# boiled (whole beans boiling in water for a few minutes)
# steamed (steaming is not brewing)
# products based on steamed coffee.

I also think all health issues are rather typical for Americans. I don't think there is much debate about coffee combined with health issues in Europe. Couldn't we improve this article by describing the at least five different ways to make coffee ? And assemble the health matters below one single headline ? There is very much else that is called for. Coffee culture in various places on Earth, as of today. Especially including  different roastings and flavors of brewed coffee. As well as the history of this morning awakening hot drink. How it got to Europe (and North America) initially etc. [[User:Boeing720|Boeing720]] ([[User talk:Boeing720|talk]]) 23:24, 21 July 2017 (UTC)

The phrase "Oromo people in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were believed to have been the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant" is wrongly represented and needs to be corrected to "Kaffa in Ethiopia were believed to have been the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant" The Oromo people were neighbors of the kingdom of Kaffa coffee plant was shared to Oromo people after the discovery of this energizing effect of coffee by the people of Kaffa. Please let's us keep the right story to the right people. As Ethiopians we should be proud of our history and send the right message to next generation.
So the history section should read as indicated below.
     
According to legend, ancestors of today's [[Kaffa people]] in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were believed to have been the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant,<ref name="Wein34"/> though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century.<ref name="Wein34"/> The story of [[Kaldi]], the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably [[apocryphal]].<ref name="Wein34"/> [[User:Yekaffanbesa|Yekaffanbesa]] ([[User talk:Yekaffanbesa|talk]]) 21:58, 14 November 2018 (UTC)

== Caffeine content section- table units ==

No a unit per se, but the value are likely percentages in decimal form, i.e., 0.054g of caffeine per 100g dark roast, coffee sack-brewed and coarsely ground coffee. Values for these things vary wildly, I'm not too bothered to dl the cited article and read the context where the table is, but it's most likely percentage in decimal.
A quick search yields values from 0.5-2.5%- here's [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Caffeine-content-in-m-m-of-the-several-coffee-grounds-studied-Commercial-fresh_tbl2_286417460 one] such.

==Forms==
I've reverted [[User:Markalexander100]]'s merging back to my previous edit. IMO, [[drip brew]] and [[filter coffee]] aren't the same. Please take a look at a description of [[filter coffee]] I just added. [[User:Ambarish|Ambarish]] | [[User talk:Ambarish|Talk]] 05:01, 20 May 2004 (UTC)

:So is the Indian filter coffee the same as western filter coffee, except that milk and sugar are always added?  If so, it would be a subcategory of [[drip brew]].   If not, we'll need some kind of disambiguation. [[User:Markalexander100|Markalexander100]] 05:32, 20 May 2004 (UTC)

::I would say that drip and filter should be integrated. What we are discussing at this point is the method of producing the ''coffee drink'', not in its presentation. Some people like it white (milk/coffee/artificial creamer) or black, some with sugar, flavoured syrups (sugared or sugar-free) and we don't want to see each and every little different presentation getting its own entry. Filter *is* drip; they both use solely gravity to contact the heated water with the coffee grounds and the articles on [[filter coffee]] and [[coffee filter]] also need to take account of this. Now then, metal filter -v- paper filter qualitative issues anyone? --[[User:VampWillow|VampWillow]] 08:12, 2004 May 20 (UTC)

::In [[coffee_(drink)#Forms]], some of the entries are about finished products, like [[Mocha]] and [[Frappuccino]]. Others are about processes or appliances - [[drip brew]] (the article says so), [[French press]] etc. As such, I think that needs cleaning up. With that in mind, Indian [[filter coffee]] is a specific kind of coffee with specific ingredients (milk and sugar) brewed using the [[coffee filter]]. [[Drip brew]] indicates it's a ''method'' of brewing coffee (this would be called the coffee decoction in India, since "coffee" would mean [[filter coffee]]). Lastly, I have no idea what is meant by Western filter coffee - have never heard the term, although I live in the US. Is it common usage? So, if [[coffee_(drink)#Forms]] is to comprise kinds of brews that people drink, then [[drip brew]] doesn't belong there. If it's to consist of brewing mechanisms, [[filter coffee]] would become a sub-category of [[drip brew]], and wouldn't feature in [[coffee_(drink)#Forms]]. <strike>I'd vote for the former, on the grounds that it's more interesting for people to know about [[Cappuccino]] and [[Latte]] than about brewing mechanisms.</strike> Let's have sections about both! [[User:Ambarish|Ambarish]] | [[User talk:Ambarish|Talk]] 08:31, 20 May 2004 (UTC)

:::I typed the above before [[User:VampWillow]]'s response, and didn't want to edit it after I got an edit conflict. If we're indeed discussing the method of production, then we should be removing [[Frappuccino]], [[Latte]], etc. Right? [[User:Ambarish|Ambarish]] | [[User talk:Ambarish|Talk]] 08:31, 20 May 2004 (UTC)

:This is getting nicely complicated!   Forms of brewing and forms of serving should both be covered somewhere, but I'd agree with separating them into two sections.  (Incidental: "filter coffee" in the UK means [http://www.coffeeco.com.au/altcof/altcoffeepage6.html this]; I can't vouch for US usage). By "decoction", do you mean that the coffee and water are boiled up together, and then the grounds are filtered out?   In which case it would be a brewing method which ''is'' different from the drip/western filter method.  [[User:Markalexander100|Markalexander100]] 08:57, 20 May 2004 (UTC)

::Sheesh .. I'm doing this and haven't made my first pot of the day yet! (am about to start on pots, btw, and just created a cross-section image). ''Frappucino'' is a trademarked name and, imho, shouldn't have a place here. Ideally I believe there should be four main sections. (i) Preparation of coffee grounds: roasting, grinding, pounding (Turkish coffee is missing), etc., (ii) Preparation of coffee drink: gravity, pressure, steeping, (iii) presentation of drink: the optional extras of sweetening, milk/coffee, foam, lattés, all the rest, and (iv) social aspects. That would give the required information in a 'pedia sort of way I think? --[[User:VampWillow|VampWillow]] 09:28, 2004 May 20 (UTC)

:::I agree about ''Frappucino'' - it is basically a trademark name for an chilled latte. The ''Grinding'' section still needs a lot of work, I just haven't had time. I like your organization scheme as well. [[User:Wishus|Wishus]] 18:58, 20 May 2004 (UTC)

:I agree with both of you. [[User:Markalexander100|Markalexander100]] 01:28, 21 May 2004 (UTC)

:::Me too! I quite like [[User:VampWillow]]'s proposal above; BTW, [[User:Markalexander100|Markalexander100]], boiling water is percolated through coffee powder in a coffee filter (http://www.techrose.org/filtercoffee/filtercoffee.jpg - couldn't find a better pic), so I guess the brewing process is similar to preparing coffee in any percolator. The difference is probably only in terminology, the resulting brew is called the decoction; once you had milk and sugar, it's called coffee. [[User:Ambarish|Ambarish]] | [[User talk:Ambarish|Talk]] 08:41, 21 May 2004 (UTC)

:I've had a go at reorganising along [[User:VampWillow]]'s lines, although I'm sure some tinkering will still be needed.

About drip brew being different from filter... I can vouch that in France, the two are used interchangeably for the stuff made in electric coffeemakers dripping hot water onto grounds held in a filter. --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] 12:28, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I may add that '''Indian''' filter coffee is different from drip brew... due to differences in preparation going far beyond the fact that the Indian way dispenses with a layer of paper... and is it just me or does that pot remind me of a percolator (moka pot, Italian coffeemaker). This is definitely a local variant that needs to be by itself, not just "another kind of" filter coffee, while 95% of world population thinks that drip brew and filter are synonymous. --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] 23:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

==Turkish coffee==

This article really needs something about Greek/Arabic/Turkish coffee[[User:Harry R|Harry R]] 16:08, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)
----
Harry R: I agree, write it for us :)

Nice work on all this folks.  This is getting pretty comprehensive now.

Indian Filter: still needs work as it looks just like white coffee in its current form.  I really like all the different cultural styles and preparation styles on this page (and even more would be great) - could this one either be rolled into White Coffee or differentiated in some way?

How about a "coffee drinking styles around the world" section? (Although per-culture rather than per-locale may be more appropriate).  Maybe that's superfluous and already included.  Anyway just a thought :)

I like the breaking up of preparation and presentation and its current form, nice work.
[[User:Mat-C|Mat-C]] 16:19, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)

What's the deal with the description of Turkish coffee?  Someone keeps removing the Greek coffee references, then someone else restores it, then the cycle repeats.  Should the Greek coffee references be there or not?  --[[User:Coyoty|Coyoty]] 03:42, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
:It's an ethnic thing. Greeks have strong feelings about Turks, and themselves always call it Greek coffee. It seems to be most generally known as Turkish coffee though, and so that's what we should call it here.  (Also, although it's distribution and names in various languages is discussed in the Preparation section, someone wants it repeated in under Presentation.  It plainly doesn't have to be in both places.) ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' <small>[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]</small> 05:41, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

== Latte vs. Latté ==

To the anon that removed the accent from latté: In my experience the variant with accent has seen more general use than the variant without the accent; I would believe that the version with the accent is most closely intended by the original. I would appreciate an explanation for your logic behind your removal thereof. -- [[User:Grunt|Grunt]] [[User_talk:Grunt|(talk)]] 00:27, 2004 Jun 27 (UTC)

Glad to explain. First, English doesn't have accents, although English speakers often copy them from foreign languages in loanwords. Second, the loanword "latte" is from Italian, and the Italian word doesn't have an accent. (Caffe does.) So, I don't think it belongs there. 

:I don't really care all that much one way or the other, but the ubiquitous [http://www.starbucks.com/retail/beverages.asp Starbucks] spells it without the accent. Not that that proves anything, but for an awful lot of Americans, Starbucks is synonymous with specialty coffees like latte. [[User:Bkonrad|older]]<font color=blue>'''&ne;'''</font>[[User talk:Bkonrad|wiser]] 00:37, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::Websters spells it without an accent; it gives the derivation as the Italian caffelatte (one word, no accents), which is a contraction of caffè e latte (grave accent).   If it's right, I think no accent wins. [[User:Markalexander100|Markalexander100]] 03:01, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)


==Fat retention b/c of coffee==
A friend of mine said someone on ''Oprah'' said that something in coffee causes fat retention...anybody know anything about this? [[User:Jengod|jengod]] 23:39, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)
:I really don't know. The ancient Arabs believed coffee caused loss of sleep and loss of manhood. Heck, they even banned coffee for a while on that count (circa 1539 CE). :-) BTW, Oprah? Oprah? *groan* [[User:Cheeni|Cheeni]] 21:38, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:It's probably taken out of context.  The American coffee-drinking habits, with lots of sugar and milk in their coffee cups, is probably the real culprit.  The elevated heart rate from the caffeine contributes an insignificant amount of calorie-burning throughout the day, but not enough to help you lose or gain weight.  The problem may be the mood-swing that it can induce in certain people, which may lead to more eating to compensate for the caffeine low.  Either way, I have never heard anything about this and a quick google search brought back nothing useful.  [[User:Julius.kusuma|Julius.kusuma]] 14:33, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Coffee apparently raises cortisol levels, which encourages fat retention, especially abdominal fat retention (as does stress, because cortisol levels rise in response to stress).  I didn't do an extensive search, but here's an article with basic information about cortisol: http://www.janethull.com/newsletter/0404/cortisol.php

== Marqaha ==

Hi, this article is looking good. I recently ran across (in the zine ''Too Much Coffee Man'', as a matter of fact) a mention of an Arabic word, "marqaha," which means something like "coffee euphoria," -- it's a specific term for the buzz you get from drinking coffee. 

After googling about a bit, it does seem that the word exists:

"Coffee-drinkers even coined their own term for the euphoria it produced — marqaha."
http://www.superluminal.com/cookbook/essay_coffee.html

I found the existence of this word interesting, but I wasn't sure it belonged in the article (perhaps just in Wiktionary...). In any case, now I've mentioned it. :)

==Presentation==

I was thinking of editing the "Presentation" section to reflect the fact that "White Coffee" is commonly called a "Flat White" in Australia, and "Black Coffee" is commonly called a "Long Black", but thought that there is probably further variations on this in other countries. Perhaps we could have a table with the regional terms for each style of presentation? Mmmmm, coffee! [[User:Malcolmj|Malcolmj]] 00:23, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Medical uses of coffee/caffeine ==

Someone earlier mentioned uses of coffee for Alzheimer's and diabetes.  If this subject is treated in the article, its use in migraine headache should also be mentioned.  Some migraineurs can abort a migraine by drinking a strong cup of coffee as they feel it coming on.  Also, caffeine is combined with several headache (and probably non-headache) drugs for a different reason - it intensifies the potency of the companion drug.--[[User:Harrykaplan|Harrykaplan]] 16:06, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: "probably non-headache) drugs" Yes indeed, it's in [[Midol]], for instance.  But perhaps there should just be mention of a few uses of the pure drug, with the rest moved to [[caffeine]].  A mention of the traditional coffee [[enema]] here would be appropriate, though.


==Coffee Bean Redirect==
I'm not so sure that "coffee bean" should redirect here, as it is the informal (and most common) name for [[The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf]]. Ask most people from Southern California, and they'll tell you that the term and the store are synonymous. --[[User:Hersch|Hersch]] 21:40, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
:If people are looking for the store and search "Coffee bean", I'm sure that they won't be surprised to arrive at coffee. If people are searching for the coffee bean, and search "Coffee bean", I'm sure that they'd be pretty surprised to arrive at some californian store. [[User:Madd4Max|Madd4Max]] 12:34, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::I agree with [[User:Hersch|Hersch]]. (I too live in So Cal.) If someone were looking for the store, searched for "coffee bean", and got [[Coffee]], what would they do if they didn't remember the full name of the store?

::If I didn't remember the name I would search for "coffee bean company".  It doesn't make sense that the company becomes more important than an encyclopedic term, and "coffee beans" is one.  The popular southeast asian drink "Bandung" should not be made more important than the actual city of [[Bandung]], in which nobody knows what Bandung the drink is.  However, "Bandung" the drink is briefly mentioned at the bottom of the page [[Bandung]].  Southern Californians will have to deal with it ;-).  I'm in agreement with [[User:WormRunner|WormRunner]].  [[User:Julius.kusuma|Julius.kusuma]] 17:01, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:As someone who does NOT live in southern california, I find the idea of a world-class encyclopedia linking first to some local chain rather than the world usage of coffee bean idiotic.

==Claude Saks==

Check out Claude's book  "Strong Brew: One Man's Prelude to Change".   A most excellent introduction to the commodity trading aspect of coffee, a rough and nasty business, but a great way to see the world.  Following is a review from Amazon.com.   
Saks calls this book a prequel to his Inescapable Journey: A Spiritual Adventure (1995), an account of his spiritual quest, which led him to Taoism and Buddhism. In some ways, Saks' story parallels that of Mark Ritchie, who wrote God in the Pits: Confessions of a Commodities Trader (1989), though there are important differences. Ritchie founded a firm that grew to become the world's largest options trading company, his relationship with his father profoundly affected his life, and his own Christian beliefs conflicted with the demands and trappings of his livelihood. But unlike Ritchie, who used his father's altruism as a model, Saks sought his father's respect by following him in business. The Sakses traded coffee on the commodities markets, but they also fought constantly. They split, and Claude formed his own company, which became the largest importer of coffee in the U.S. Saks provides a highly personal account of what it was like in this fast-paced, competitive business as he traveled across Africa and East Asia.

== History of Coffee ==

I was thinking of editing the history of coffee. I can offer a timeline of coffee that would be of interest to everyone. I'm the author of a new book called "The Truth About Caffeine" which is published by SCR Books, LLC.  An example is below.

525 - Early in the sixth century, the Abyssinian nation (what is
now known as the modern-day country of Ethiopia) unknowingly
brought wild coffee plants to the Arabian Peninsula when its troops
invaded the country of Yemen.

600 - While dates vary from 600-850, most sources credit the
discovery of coffee to an Abyssinian goatherd called Kaldi who
notices his goats acting strangely after eating the berries from a
nearby bush. Seeing the increased feistiness of the goats, Kaldi
tastes the berry himself, and appreciating the jolt of energy - without
any way of foreseeing the phenomenal global trend he was starting –
begins more than a millennium of coffee-ingesting.

650 - After learning about coffee from Kaldi, local monks
experiment with the beans. The monks tried mixing them with
water, as well as drying the coffee berries and transporting them to
far-off monasteries, because they understand the power of the
beans to keep them awake during prayers.

:Are you the one who added the timeline to the history section, which was recently reverted?  This seemed like a worthwhile addition to me, but it's perhaps too lengthy to be part of this article.  I suggest adding it as a seperate article [[Timeline of coffee]] and adding a "See also" link to the History section.

:Additional note... I think "The Women's Petition Against Coffee", 1674 should be given a mention.  As early evidence of coffee's ills.  I saw it in a newspaper article today.  [http://staff-www.uni-marburg.de/~gloning/wom-pet.htm] [[User:Mdrejhon|Mdrejhon]] 15:13, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

== Coffee bean varieties ==

I expanded this section a bit, including more information on the coffee growing regions for the different varieties, and tried to seperate the list of beans themselves from the discussions of coffee blends and other subjects.  If other blends merit special attention, perhaps that can be a new list, but I think mixing blends and beans confuses the subject somewhat.  Hopefully more varieties can be added as people think of them.

== Benefits / Risks sections ==

Some of the things stated as facts in the Benefits/Risks sections seem like a study may have reached that conclusion, but are not necessarily widely accepted facts. I don't know enough about these studies to edit those sections confidently, but could someone who knows a bit more consider whether each item in those sections is just a claim based on a study, or a widely accepted fact? - [[User:James Foster|James Foster]] 08:39, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

I agree. In particular, the bit about curing asthma seems dubious at best. My understanding of caffeine use in the older migraine medications was for its cerebral vasoconstrictor effects - not anything to do with analgesic potentiation  [[User:Bignoter|bignoter]]

Removed the initial paragraph mentioning [[caffeinism]] and its reputed relation to [[psychiatric disorders]]. [[Caffeinism]] is a neologism. Additionally the claim its causes [[psychiatric disorders]] is not supported by credible scientific studies. [[User:Vassyana|Vassyana]] 03:30, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

I additionally removed the paragraph detailing [[caffeine]] and replaced it with an introductory reference to [[caffeine]]. [[User:Vassyana|Vassyana]] 03:30, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

== Economic Aspects of Coffee ==

I have read frequently that coffee is the world’s second most traded commodity, (After oil). I have thought about this for quite a while, and the numbers just don’t jive. Here is my math (please correct as you see fit, all numbers approximate):

Annual coffee production (2002) 115,800,000 60 kilo bags (http://www.nybot.com/minicoffee/qcoffee.pdf) 
=6.95 billion kilos
@ 2.2 lbs/kilo = 15.3 billion lbs
That included robusta, but let’s be generous and say $0.50/lb
= $7.65 billion

Daily oil production ~ 72 million bbl (Click Here (www.worldoil.com) I am a bit conservative)
1 bbl/day production ~ 55 tons (US)/yr
=72,000,000*55*2000
~7.9 trillion lbs
=72,000,000*365
~26 billion bbl/yr
@ $35/bbl (we in Texas thank you for this, by the way)
~$920 billion

So on one hand, we have 7.9 trillion lbs of oil vs 11 billion lbs of coffee

Or

$920 billion of oil vs $5.5 billion of coffee

My point is that there is too much distance between these numbers for coffee to be #2 (I think that copper production is worth about $18 billion, for example: Click Here (mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca)) 

I think that this is a meme that is left over from the 1930s or something (I think it is mentioned in Uker’s) that just keeps getting repeated.

But I am willing to be corrected…

:I don't actually know, but that doesn't stop me from reacting :) . Mostly, what this comparison can be taken to say is not so much how big the coffee market is, but how humongous the oil market is. Almost 20 times bigger by your calculation. But which figures do you use? About 0.2 usd per kg of coffee. Is that the price the farmers get or the intermediary companies and at what shackle along the (re)selling chain? And do you use the same basis for the oil-calculation? (I cant make heads or tails of the units you're using, so I can't do any proper calculations for myself.) [[User:DirkvdM|DirkvdM]] 08:12, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

When I did those calculations oil was at $35/bbl and coffee at about $0.50/Lb (or $1.10/kg - all usd). Since both have about doubled. And you are correct that I don't factor in the value add that coffee gets by going through the Starbucks chain I would guess about 34g of ground, roasted coffee in a $4.00 latte) but then I don't calculate the value add in the oil industry either.

Mainly, I am questioning the fact that "everyone knows" that coffee is the second most traded commodity. It simply doesn't seem possible. Look at my copper calculations. You can link though on my reference sites for the origen of my data.

:The sensible values to use for both coffee and oil are the spot values on the commodity exchanges, ISTM.

(If they're there, I don't see it.) Still, the fact that the ''copper'' market appears to be bigger than that for coffee is telling.

* [Copying my comment from [[WP:FAC]] to here] re: second most-traded commodity -- I find data to suggest it is not true.  See for example [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/tdstat27_enfr.pdf UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics] (caution: large PDF), specifically section 4.2A, beginning on page 156 (print page number)/182 (PDF page number).  The interpretation depends a bit on what one considers a commodity, but it's hard to make coffee number two under any definition. --[[User:Tabor|Tabor]] 21:09, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

* More info:  found one source that ascribed the quotation to the Interational Coffee Organization.  Looking at the bottom of [http://www.ico.org/coffee_story.asp this page], it appears that in fact what they say is much more qualified:
::''[Coffee] is one of the most valuable primary products in world trade, in many years second in value only to oil as a source of foreign exchange to developing countries.''

::Be nice, 148.104.5.2. See [[WP:CIVIL]]. There are at least two problems with talking to an IP address, but it's true that neither is that big a deal. 1) A lot of people have dynamic IP addresses, which change every time they log on. 2) It's harder to remember a number than a name, so it's harder to determine if edits or comments are from the same person. Phrased differently, all IP addresses tend to blur into one big, hazy identity. That said, if you have some reason you don't want an account, nobody should try to stop you.

You ''could'' call it whipped, since one method of whipping milk (or cream) is to inject gas into it, but hot water vapor is really suboptimal for this purpose -- it works best when the milk is cold -- and it normally isn't done long enough to properly whip the milk anyway.

It's tangential, but I don't like how the article describes the English speaker's cafe. In English, a cafe is more like the French variety except that alcoholic beverages are seldom or never sold. It is not a place to eat a meal, that's a cafeteria. Maybe there was a misunderstanding because of the way English speakers spell cafe (w/o an accent on the letter E), but now that this is clarified it should be changed; either for this article or a new one.

== Instant Coffee ==
An example sentence from the Instant Coffee section.
<blockquote>
Opinions on instant coffee range from "intolerable imposter" through "reasonable alternative" to "better than the real thing", and in some areas of the world it is seen as a sophisticated beverage popular in the United States due to the fact that it was the norm in American homes until the 1980s.
</blockquote>

There are many problems with the above sentence. 
# It is too long and needs to be split into multiple parts. I would have done this myself, except for the next problem.
# The second half of the sentence makes it sound that because instant coffee was "the norm" in American homes until the 1980s it is the prevailing opinion in some parts of the World that:
## Instant coffee is sophisticated, and 
## It is popular in the United States!
# At no point are any claims backed up with facts.

Suggested corrections.
# Split the sentence into multiple parts.
# Replace "the norm" with authoritative figures on the decline of instant coffee use in the United States.
# Establish that the higher consumption of instant coffee in coffee-exporting regions is due to people in those areas copying households in the United States, rather than the difference in price between instant coffee and brewed arabica coffee.

Most of this section is in need of similar rewrites. For example the first sentence reads "Instant and soluble coffee has been dried into soluble powder or granules...". So the instant coffee has been dried, rather than is the product of drying brewed coffee!

== Coffee does not adversely impact higher mental functions? ==
As a 4th year med student, I'd have to say that the idea, found in the following quote, that coffee does not adversely impact higher mental functions, is at the worst wrong and at the least quite misleading.  If the idea is to say that it is a relatively benign stimulant compared to other illicit drugs, then perhaps it is just better to say something to that effect.  "Because of the stimulant properties of coffee and because coffee does not adversely impact higher mental functions, coffee is strongly associated with white collar jobs and office workers."  

I've otherwise enjoyed reading this article, although I am frustrated by coffee being referred to as a "bean" in popular reference.  Although it is good to see it referred to as a seed in the article, I'm wondering if it would be good to point out that it is the pit of a fruit.  Ok, if you have read this far, I thank you for your time. {{User|71.57.95.49}}

:If you agree with this, please [[WP:CITE|CITE]] sources that disprove its premise. I'm not sure why you disagree with the "bean" thing.

==Social aspects of coffee==

I apologize. I am new to Wikipedia, and this is the first time I've engaged in childish "revert war" behavior. I have no excuse, except that I've not yet developed the social experience within this community to school myself yet. I will, in the future, got o discussion first.

That said, I *do* think the paragraph in question has some merit, and shouldn't be simply deleted. I would like some discussion on this matter before it goes away again. So far the only reason stated (in the rev comment) has to do with it being meaningless to anyone who doesn't watch American TV (as I understand it). I don't watch any of the shows mentioned, but recognise the thought there as a sort of "cultural literacy" issue, and therefore appropriate to Wikipedia. [[User:Scix|Scix]] 02:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, the ''main'' reason I gave was that the paragraph was mostly about TV shows.  To put it more precisely, it made a claim about a social trend which it then tried to support by citing a bunch of TV shows that took up most of the paragraph.  This is an extremely unreliable and not terribly rigorous way of documenting social trends. When shows like [[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]], [[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]], and [[Falcon Crest]] were popular, consider the completely inaccurate view of mainstream American society most non-Americans took from them. "It's true because I saw it in a sitcom" just doesn't work, I'm afraid.

:At least, that's why I wanted it deleted.  I have no idea why [[User:Malencontreux]] got rid of it in the first place, but I support his action.

:Since we are left with no credible support for the claim that's made and no other sources are cited, this is not a paragraph that ought to be retained. If the claim is actually true (and it probably is) then there ought to be good documentation for it somewhere. So really, you're right but for the wrong reasons IMO.  I'd sooner see it fixed than deleted myself, but I don't have any sources either.

== Decaf Coffee question. ==

Is there a point when decaf coffee can become caffinated again?

:I suppose you could add No-Doz to it.  But if you mean, will the caffeine magically reappear after it's been removed? No. ''[[User:Csernica|TCC]]'' <small>[[User_talk:Csernica|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Csernica|(contribs)]]</small> 01:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

:: You sure about this?  Do you have any kind of evidence of such?  I only mean to clarify.  You see, I work for a company that tells us to change out the decaf coffee every 20 minutes or it cafinates again.  I am not sure how this works, as it sounded bogus to me.  Obviously the coffee becomes bitter (well, even more bitter, seeing as how our company coffee really sucks..)

:I don't have evidence for this, but I don't need any. I have a basic education in chemistry and physics and I therefore don't believe in the spontaneous generation of matter, absent the rare miraculous event. The coffee that you brew had the caffeine removed a long time ago, before it was even roasted. Removed, note, not reacted into some other substance: the beans are steamed and then rinsed in a solvent that carries the caffeine away. See [[decaffeination]]. There is simply no way for the caffeine to return after brewing it. It's a silly idea. Perhaps someone at your work is trying to have a little fun with you.

:It's always a good idea to change coffee out after 20 minutes or a half hour, but that's true whether it's decaffeinated or not. Good coffee gets noticeably stale after that time.

''A study has shown that cafestol, a substance which is present in boiled coffee drinks, dramatically increases cholesterol levels, especially in women.

:There is no need to define "boiled coffee drinks". The literal reading of the phrase is quite sufficient and clear. I fail to see how such a phrasing is in the least unclear.

::I suspect -- although I do not know for sure since I haven't looked at the source for the study mentioned -- that the distinguishing factor here is that that coffee grounds are in contact with the boiling water for a relatively extended period.

:::From what I can gather by researching the issue, the time exposure is a factor not well studied. It seems to be a mostly academic question, since "single pass" methods using boiled water (such as traditional percolators) still contain the elevated levels of cafestol. Drip coffee's lower risks and higher benefits also derive from the use of paper filters, according to medical and scientific papers on the matter.

::::Is the same true then for coffee made in a French press?  If so, then this has nothing at all to do with "boiled" coffee as such because you brew in a press with water of the proper temperature, which should not be boiling, and it is indeed the paper filter.

The descriptions of New Zealand "long black" and "flat white" are not entirely accurate: these terms both refer solely to certain espresso-based preparations. The closest US equivalent to "long black" is the so-called "Americano", but that is not exactly the same. A NZ barista could tell you the difference, presumably.

This article here [http://www.realcoffee.co.uk/Article.asp?Cat=History&Page=3] and another one here [http://cocoajava.com/java_trivia.html] says it was a Turkish Jew named Mr Jacobs that introduced Turkish coffee to England and other sources says it was [http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/bmh/BMH-IRO-coffee_houses.htm] [http://www.theowljournal.com/article.php?issue=2&number=7&type=print&comments=1] Ragusian man-servant known as Pasqua Rosee. Mr Rosee had been brought to England from Ottoman Smyrna by his former employer, Mr Daniel Edwards, a “Turkish merchant” (one who dealt in coffee and other such luxury items).

Update: Okay this article [http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/jan/27.htm] states that the Turkish Jew Mr Jacobs opened up the first coffee shop with Mr Daniel Edwards' servant Pasqua Rosee opening up one a few years later. Meanwhile this article states that manservant Pasqua Rosee was Greek(?) and that the Turkish Jew Mr. Jacobs opened England's first coffeehouse in Oxford in 1650. But it seems from many sources that the first Turkish coffee house in England was established by a Mr Jacobs. [[User:82.145.231.12|82.145.231.12]] 17:42, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
:"Pasqua Rosée" (to accent it as one source puts it, probably correctly) is patently not a Greek name, and your sources in fact say he was [[Ragusa]]n, which makes him [[Sicily|Sicilian]].  Also, the name of the Oxford coffeehouse owner seems to be unclear. The realcoffee.co.uk source says "Jacob", while the bookofdays.com source says "Jacobs"; it's only the cocoajava.com article that calls him "Mr. Jacobs".  It's difficult to say therefore whether a first name or surname is intended here; either is plausible. I'll edit appropriately.

==coffee negative effects==
I read in new scientist it think it was about a new study of the supposed negative effects of coffee. In this the apparently found that a lot of negative effects could be down to the relationship with smoking, eg almost everyone who smokes drinks  a ot of coffee but virtually noone who doesn't drink coffee smokes. I think also they found that the filtering of coffee removed some negative substance/s but they didn't know what. Just thought twas quite interesting, don't know if anyone has seen the study and could give any details as to te surety of these statements.[[User:131.111.8.96|131.111.8.96]]

:Smoking can be a confounding variable in any study, and I would assume that most good researchers would take that into account, and separate smokers from non-smokers in their results. The filtering of coffee through various methods (such as drip brew, I believe) removes the majority of [[cafestol]], a diterpene that can raise cholesterol levels. It is interesting, however, that cafestol also has anticarcinogenic activity [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6P-461X4N4-6&_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2002&_alid=373263021&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=5036&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000059601&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4428&md5=868fe7c1f2caa98d7c04b15ca5b85e99].

==Confusing==
"Electronic coffee makers boil the water and brew the infusion with little human assistance and sometimes according to a timer. Some even grind the beans automatically before brewing. Connoisseurs shun such conveniences as compromising the flavor of the coffee; they prefer freshly ground beans and traditional brewing techniques."
So we're saying the coffee maker freshly grinds the coffee for each cup, but connoisseurs (ALL connoisseurs mind you) ''shun'' these machines because they want freshly ground coffee. The machines brew the infusion according to a set time, but ALL connoisseurs ''shun'' these machines in favour of ''traditional brewing techniques'', such as espresso machines and brewing the infusion for a set amount of time? These connoiseurs must be different to the connoiseurs I've met, whose entire job is brewing and tasting coffee. [[User:57.66.51.165|57.66.51.165]] 14:45, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

== Phase 2 restructuring ==

I just whacked the article with a stick again, this time with an eye towards reorganizing it so it made sense.  I moved the "economics of coffee" and "health" sections up substantially, since we are talking about one of the most widely traded commodities in the world; I put them ahead of the "preparation" section because it is more important that we tell people what coffee is, and why it is important, than that we tell them how to make it.  I rewrote and tightened up a lot of unnecessary verbosity (we could still do a lot more here).  A number of minor sections had section headers when they didn't really warrant it -- they interrupt the flow of the article.  I massively tightened and trimmed the whole section on "quick coffee".  I added a <nowiki>citeneeded</nowiki> to a statement that needed it.  (I also eliminated or moved to other articles a number of interesting but nonessential tidbits (such as where the mother plant for Arabica is).

Still lots of work to be done.  This article is still 30k long.  Any suggestions for good candidates for removal or things that could be moved to their own article?  [[User:Nandesuka|Nandesuka]] 22:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

== Varietals ==

A coffee varietal is simply the genetic subspecies of coffee.  This includes Caturra, Bourbon, SL-28, and any other species of coffee.  Kona, Jamaican Blue Mountain and Kenya AA do not count in any way as varietals.  Kona is a place in Hawaii, not a coffee.  Jamaican Blue Mountain means it comes from Jamaica, nothing more.  And Kenya AA is used to describe the size of the beans.  Not to mention in the Coffee varietals section it lists "Colombian" as a varietal.  Considering Colombia is one of the world's largest suppliers of green coffee (#4), I would assume there is more than one subspecies of coffee there.

Also, where it says "Coffee beans from two different places, or coffee varietals, usually have distinctive characteristics", places do not equal varietals.

::It's not clear to me what statistics are being used by either of these unreferenced statements.

== "Most Consumed Beverage" ==

There has been some disagreement over whether the claim that coffee is the most consumed beverage in the world.  I did some digging in to this a little while ago.  Most of the claims I found about what beverage was or was not the most consumed in the world were random, unsourced statements from the web.  I finally found a cite from the Journal of the American Medical Association claiming that coffee had the honor.  If someone else can find a different reliable source that claims that tea (or water) is the most consumed beverage, please put it here so we can note the disagreement.  Thanks. [[User:Nandesuka|Nandesuka]] 11:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)


: The [[tea]] article maintains that the most consumed beverage is water. This article cites an abstract from a scientific paper that claims that coffee is the most drunk beverage in the world. I simply cannot believe that more coffee would be consumed than water, when many of the most populated regions of the world are struggling to get access even to water! Even in those countries that are coffee producers, coffee may not be frequently consumed; rather, it is exported for cash (most of these people are very poor, they wouldn't consume it if they can sell it). Which is somewhat beside the point, since the question really is: how does the world's coffee production compare to its drinking water consumption? I believe the authors were motivated by the need to justify their research, and argue for the important for their paper to get it into JAMA. I suspect they are making a claim that does not hold. In fact, the abstract being an abstract, it does not cite any sources for the claim, and it is not the subject of the paper (the paper is about diabetes and therefore should never have been cited in this context in the first place). Please come up with a better source for this claim, or amend the claim to something more tenable. Many thanks, [[User:Samsara|{{{2|Samsara}}}]] ([[User talk:Samsara|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Samsara|contribs]]) 12:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

:: The fact that the [[tea]] article disagrees with this one isn't really relevant, since that article doesn't cite any sources for that claim.  If we can find a reliable source that disagrees with the JAMA article, that's one thing, but it is completely inappropriate to remove the claim based on our own personal beliefs. As for how coffee might be more consumed than water, as the article on [[water]] notes, much of the water in the world is not [[potable water]].  When the water in an area is not potable as-is, people drink substitute drinks &mdash; such as beer, wine, coffee, or tea &mdash;  that have been processed which make the water safer.   Do I know that that's what's happening here?  No, it's just my theory, and is thus inappropriate for inclusion in the article.  What ''is'' appropriate is citing claims made by reliable sources.

Part of properly citing a source is interpreting that source correctly.  If a source claims that coffee is the most consumed beverage, then the statement must mean "of all flavored beverages" or something similar.  There is simply no way to avoid logic and common sense when interpreting almost all sources -- textual contexts almost always necessarily omit a great number of facts which are assumed to be common knowledge of the reader (e.g., that coffee consists of more than half water.)  

To argue that a source must be trusted without actually having read the source is far worse than relying on common sense or logic to put a source's statement in context. [[User:BenB4|BenB4]] 13:28, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

How can coffee consumption account for 1/3 of total tap water consumption? I find it hard to believe that such a large amount of water is used for the making of coffee. I take myself as an example. I drink a lot of coffee about 1 litre on a day, which is more than the average person. I also take a shower once a day which accounts for the consumption of about 12 litres of water. Then there is the water used for cooking which probably accounts for 1 litre a day. So on average I consume 14 liters of water with 1 litre for coffee. So I use about 1/14 parts of water for coffee. I don't think most other people are much different (at least in developed countries). So how on earth do you people think that 1/3 of all tap water is used for coffee. I thing it is improbable. Please enlighten me.
:Well, you see, we are slavishly following the sources. Common sense is apparently not ''en vogue'' any more.

I took the liberty of removing the 1/3 water usage for coffee on this page. Just to see it added again in about 5 minutes of time. I am not going to edit this article ad nauseam just for the sake of an edit war. Perhaps the origanal author can present some credible number to back the 1/3 used of water used for coffee claim? Come one let's have an open discussion. I am not saying it is impossible that 1/3 of water is used for coffee i just want that this claim is verifiable. This an enclypedia right? So back up your claims!
:Well, you're doing the right thing discussing it. This is the reference for the statement:
:http://www.iwapublishing.com/template.cfm?name=news70&br=w21
:It is unclear whether the claim is from the cited paper, in which case it is unreliable as the paper deals with cancer, not with water usage, or whether the "International Water Association" (how notable are they? they don't have a Wikipedia article...) threw in their own numbers obtained through whatever means. - [[User:Samsara|{{{2|Samsara}}}]] ([[User talk:Samsara|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Samsara|contribs]]) 14:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

:We are talking about a beverage here, so "consumption" is presumably in the gastronomic sense only, not the more general "used for anything at all" sense. Showering and doing the laundry do not seem relevant. [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 15:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

If you state water consumption, this includes all water consumption not just the amount of fluids that are actually drunk! So showering is important if you are stating a percentage of water comsumption, since the WORD consumption does not actually relate to imbibing fluids (although drinking is obviously a way of consuming water it is just not the only way to consume water!). So we could reforumalate the claim to be that 1/3 of all liquids drunk are actually coffee which indeed could be true, but is NOT backed nor claimed by the cited article!

:Consuming involves using ''up''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/consume], but changing it to "drinking" is fine with me if it solves your problem. As for the the 1/3 value itself, the referenced article states exactly that: "Coffee consumption, which on average makes up about a third of tap water consumption," [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 19:53, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

If you change it to drinking that would be fine with me, but you also need a credible source for the statement that 1/3 of drinks consumed is coffee. Your article does not stipulate in any way how they calculated the 1/3 percentage. This is important because it is not simple to calculate the amount of coffee consumed vs all drinks consumed. You could try to find numbers about the total beverage consumption in one country and the total coffee consumption in that country and calculate the percentage of drinks drunk that are actually coffee. But you will need reliable sources for that calculation. It stupid to just copy the 1/3 number from the article you cited, because it just an article saying that 1/3 of drinks consumed are coffee, but we need hard, statistically sound numbers to back such a claim. That means hard work and has te be done. If one is not inclined to do such work the 1/3 claim must go.

:The study that article is describing is (apparently) ''International Journal of Cancer'' '''2006''' ''118''(8) 2040–2047, which pooled drinking-habit data from other studies in several different countries. It states states "coffee constituted on average about one third of the total tap water ingestion." [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 20:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

Ok that indeed looks sound. Make a link to the international Journal of Cancer and use their words: "1/3 of tapwater *ingestion* constitutes coffee". See they use the word ingestion that actually is a word which excludes other forms of water usage. Drinking = ingestion. It would be even better if you could find the study which the Journal of Cancer actually relied on. It might seem a bit overdone but it would make the claim even more credible. I feel we are converging on this point

==Etymology==

This article derives the word Coffee from Kahve meaning wine or other intoxicating liquors in Ottoman Turkish, but the article Caffè states that "Caffè is the Italian word for coffee, (itself from Kaffa, the region in Ethiopia where coffee originated".  If Kahve was, indeed, a general term for intoxicating liquors then there seems to be a contradiction here.

Also I don't understand the quotation from  Léonard Rauwolf that "Its consumers take it in the morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup that is passed around and from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the fruit from a bush called bunnu."  Surely after the first consumer drank a cupful from the cup it would have been emptied?  Could it be that the words translated as "porcelain cup" should be rendered "porcelain jug" or else that the consumers each drank a mouthful rather than a cupful?

One fairly consistent finding has been the reduction of diabetes mellitus type 2 in coffee consumers, an association that cannot be explained by the caffeine content alone and indeed may be stronger in decaffeinated coffee.[24]

== Caffeine ==

The role of caffeine in coffee's popularity seems pretty central to me, but the word "caffeine" only gets mentioned about 3 times in the article.  It definitely should get more mention.

Someone mentioned decaffeinated coffee -- I think that should get some attention somewhere in the article, too.  It shows that coffee has become so central to life -- or so popular for its taste --  that some people will resort to drinking it without the factor that brought about its popularity in the first place. --[[User:Rschmertz|Rschmertz]] 06:51, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

Although 'coffee' has become partly synonymous with 'caffeine', this is only part of the story. Isn't there more caffeine per cup (usually) in tea than in coffee? The other alkaloids in coffee deserve at least the same importance. What coffee does that caffeine on its own doesn't is, inter alia, to affect part of the human hormonal system; the 'day/night' regulator mechanism.

Also, there seems to be no mention so far of the crucial effect of temperature on the brew. In order to maximise the proportion of 'nice' exctracts the temperature should, according to Dr Johnson's preferences, not exceed 95 degrees C. An alternative extraction process, the expresso method, uses higher temperature but a very short extraction time. At higher temperature and with longer extraction times the proportions of bitter, 'jangly' as I experience them, constituents increases. It's easy to test this. Either make two brews using boiling and slightly cooled water, OR use just the first portion through the expresso machine and on a different occasion the later portions. 

Given that this coffee stuff provides a variety of drugs, one might as well get the best out of it. As I experience coffee there are clearly a number of contituents. I don't actually know what they are chemically, but I do have a fair clue as to which I prefer. It would be useful to have information on the known consitutents and on how to maximise the desired effects while minimising any disadvantages. This seems to me to be a matter of either using water that is not boiling (albeit that boiling water is appropriate for tea) or to discard the later portions of production from an expresso machine.

== "Second most traded commodity after oil" is unverified and not supported by available data ==

Hey everyone,

I am in the process of purging this pernicious statistic from the Wikipedia articles about coffee, because, well, it's just not true.  Yes, you will see it mentioned nearly everywhere, but if you take the time to trace it to a <s>primary</s> secondary source (which is, in itself, nearly impossible), you will find the only time that this may have been true was in '''1986'''.  Someone cited that data in a book, and it was such an exciting number to coffee folks that they ran with it and never looked back (or checked to see if it was still true 10, 15 or 20 years later).  Now it is more or less accepted as common knowledge—except that since then, coffee has fallen behind other agricultural products in value, which you can verify by using the UN Food And Agriculture database for export values (compare coffee, for example, to wheat, maize, soybean, sugar, and palm oil over the last 10 years).  This is an old myth that needs to be put to rest.  Feel free to move where I put the information (I simply replaced the old "second to oil" sentence), but please don't change the data unless you can verify it with a <s>primary</s> secondary source (Proctor and Gamble and ICO press releases aren't <s>primary</s> secondary sources!)  [[User:Margareta|Margareta]]

:Could you post a link to the "UN Food And Agriculture database for export values" that compares the level of trade in the various commodities, in particular if coffee is not second, where is it in the list, or, if not that, what is first, second, third?  Searching for the terms you provide I cannot find this information.  It's not value, also, the statistic is "the most traded commodity," not "the most valuable commodity."  Coffee was never the msot or second most or even in the top ten of valuable commodities that I've ever seen.  So, please provide sources to the most traded commodities or the placement of coffee in the most traded commodities list.  [[User:KP Botany|KP Botany]] 21:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

The FAO data is from a series of queries to their Trade database run last year.  The databases can be found here: http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx.  At that time, the most current data they had was from 2003, when coffee was the sixth largest ''agricultural'' commodity (measured by value of exports), after wheat, soybeans, maize, sugar and palm oil.   The database does not list commodities such as oil, precious metals, etc.  I don't have a list of the "most traded commodities or the placement of coffee in the most traded commodities list."  What I can tell you is that, if coffee is only the sixth-largest agricultural commodity, then it is certainly not the second largest commodity overall!  Also, the position of coffee changes every year: in 1986, it was, in fact, the number one agricultural commodity, and in 3 years in the 1990's it was second, after wheat.  To say "coffee is" when talking talking about highly volatile commodity markets risks having the statement be nearly immediately out-of-date.  Whenever I see the "second-most" whatever (the "whatever" changes from source to source: some say "traded," some say "valuable," some just say "important," whatever that means-- and this is true even of peer-reviewed articles), in the rare cases when I have been able to trace it back to a <s>primary</s> secondary source, the <s>primary</s> secondary source is always from the late 1980's.  For example, Talbot (Grounds for Agreement, published in 2004) cited data from 1988.  So it is possible that, in 1986 when coffee was the top agricultural commodity in terms of total export value, it was also the second commodity overall.  I haven't been able to verify this, as I haven't been able to go back to the couple of cited <s>primary</s> secondary sources to check that they really say what the people who cite them say they do.  On the other hand, if you are talking about total volume of contracts sold (as opposed to value), the situation could be different.  This, of course, has as much to do with the level of speculation in the different commodity markets than with the real value of the product, or even the trade in the product.  It seems dubious that, as we are coming off a highly speculative bull market in precious metals and other non-agrocultural commodities, coffee would even come in second by this definition  A ''New York Times'' article earlier this year said that coffee had the second-highest trading volume, in terms of contracts (by which a single quantity of coffee can be bought and sold many times) on the New York ''agricultural'' exchange, after sugar.  Of course coffee is also traded on other exchanges, and may trump sugar--and all the other agricultural commodites--in those places. If you know of a good source for the total value of contracts sold worldwide for all commodities, I would love to see it.  In fact, I would love, love, love for someone to take the time to do a real analysis, using current data, of where coffee fits in global trade by the several definitions available.  Unfortunately, I don't have time to do this myself.   In the meantime, my point remains: the oft-cited "second-most" figure simply cannot be verified, except, possibly, pertaining to some time many years ago, but in many cases there is strong evidence, if not proof, that it is no longer true.

Of course it's reported in a book you're reading.  That is my point: it was printed once, 15 years ago, may once have been true, and has been repeated hundre since without ever being verified again.  It's now accepted as "common knowledge," despite the dynamic and changeable nature of global markets. Try verifying your book's <s>primary</s> secondary source.  I'm willing to bet--if there even is one--it's at least ten years old.  If you Google coffee-commodity-second-oil or a similar combination of words, you'll find thousands of places where they say that - and "valuable" is frequently confused with "traded," with no testable definition of either word provided.  However, I have never seen any data to support ''either'' assertion.  Getting something printed in a book doesn't mean it's true, and once it's in print, it will be quoted and quoted again - and repeating something often enough doesn't mean it is true, either.  However, perhaps if you can first provide your book's definition of "most traded," the name of the book you are reading, and the source your book cites (as well as, ideally, the source ''that'' source cites, and so on down to the <s>primary</s> primary or secondary source), it would be easier to address your particular question.  I have, however, tried to change the title of this thread to "Second most traded commodity after oil is unverified and not supported by current data" to make my intent clearer, but it appears I can't change the title.

:Can you just post what data you have about the most traded commodities?  And, please, check the tone at the door, I'm just trying to figure out what it is you have that lists the most traded commodities, that makes you so certain that coffee isn't the "second most traded commodity after oil."  So, please, focus on information you have about what the most traded commodities are.  And what the source of this information is.  You used the term traded, not "valuable" and traded is what the article is stating.  So, are you now saying you are talking about the most valuable and not the most traded?  I'm trying to understand what it is you are challenging, and what your information for challenging this is.

:What is, for example the "first most traded commodity?"  Is it oil?  What is the "second most traded commodity" if coffee isn't it.

Is it because you know what the first and second most traded commodities?  Fine, what are they, and what is the source for that information?  

:How do you know this is wrong?  That something is printed in a book doesn't make it wrong any more than something is posted on the web or in a book makes it right.  You know it's wrong, how do you know?  What's your source of information on the most traded commodities?  What IS the "second most traded commodity," if it's not coffee?  What commodities are more traded than coffee? 

:I'm trying to understand your sources, what told you that something else is a much more traded commodity than coffee?  That's all.  

:The book I'm reading right now is ''Coffee: A Dark History'' by Antony Wild (Hardcover - Jun 27, 2005, although mine says First American Edition).  But, please, don't make it about this book, just share with me what data you have about commodities trading that shows what is more traded than coffee, and thereby shows that the statement that "coffee is the second most traded commodity after oil" is wrong.

::To clarify one thing: I think the reason Margareta brings up "value" is that that affects how one measures trade.  After all, if we're measuring what is the most traded commodity, we're not measuring physical volume, or weight, I assume; we're talking about monetary value.  Assuming I'm right about that, then if coffee and oil were to see an equal amount of trade in dollar terms in one year, and then the value of coffee were to go down by half the next year, then even if the physical trade and consumption of these commodites remained constant, coffee would be measured as having only half the trade volume of oil, because trade volume would be measured in dollars.  Do we agree on the measurement of trade in terms of dollars (or your currency of choice)?  --[[User:Rschmertz|Rschmertz]] 04:27, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:::I don't know, that's part of what I'm trying to understand, why I want to look at the information about what are the most traded commodities, so I understand what is at stake.  Commodities trading is about locking in the price, for agricultural products, isn't it, say on how much coffee you want next month and how much you are willing to pay for it?  While the market for coffee has grown immensely over the past two decades, things like the glut of cheap Vietnamese Robustas have caused the price to go down.  So, over twenty years the volume of coffee is much greater, but the price may have dropped due to the market being overstocked with cheap coffees.  So, are buyers more worried about the price of coffee, meaning the its share in the commodities trading market is more?  Or is amount of commodities trading solely a reflection of price, in which case it seems as if it never could have been the second most traded commodity as there are lots of other agricultural goods that have a significantly larger share of the market, like needed items, say rice?

:::If it's only the value, then the article should just say value, but it doesn't say that.  I don't know that if the measurement of trade is in dollars, although that would certainly make it easier to understand.  The Wikipedia article lists units and dollars.  

:::The Euronext lists units like this, 

*Robusta futures, Unit of trading: Five tonnes 
*Options on Robusta Coffee Futures, Unit of trading: One Robusta Coffee Futures contract, $1 per tonne

:::Another site describes trade in the commodity coffee in this way (I'll post the URL tomorrow, but searching this should find it):  Trade – World coffee exports in 2003/4 are forecasted by the USDA to fall to a 3-year low of 85.87 million bags, down 5% from 90.86 million in 2002/3. The main reason for the decline in exports was simply the lower overall production of coffee in 2003/4. Brazil’s exports in 2003/4 fell sharply by 17% to 24.5 million bags as a result of the poor harvest. The US imports virtually all of its coffee consumption. 

:::In this case trade is in bags, in another its in tonnes, and you think it is in dolllars.

:::The units for oil are different, the unit for Arabicas is much smaller than the Robusta unit, also.

I have read Wild; he does not have a source for his figure.  But you are right, it is not about that book, as this is a phrase that is tossed around a lot in many places - whether they say "most traded," "most valuable," or "most important."  Wild is no better and no worse than any other author (although better referencing would have made his book much more useful).  Your confusion demonstrates exactly the problem, and this is what I am trying to get you to understand.  You appear to be fixated on this one point, the definition of "most traded" and proving that coffee is not the "second most traded"--universally, all the time.  First understand that in books, scientific literature, press releases, reports and on the internet, "most traded" ''is'' used interchangeably with "most valuable" and "most important."  You can verify this for yourself.  This alone should indicate that something is not right.  "Most traded" as a phrase has absolutely no meaning in and of itself, and yet people keep tossing around this "fact" as though it was in some way verifiable.  You say that "most traded" does not have to do with export values.  Quoting: "In this case trade is in bags, in another its in tonnes, and you think it is in dolllars."  In fact, it's both--people pay dollars (or Euros) for bags of coffee.  Regardless of which exchange it's sold on, or what unit it's sold in, it is sold for currency.  If you want to compare trade in different products using bags of coffee as your measure, then the discussion becomes meaningless, because we can't compare different products in any other terms besides value.  You can't compare trade in bags of coffee, for example, to barrels of crude oil or ounces of gold.  Trade is measured in value.  We have to be clear on that or there is really no discussion to be had.

I can also tell you that I have spent a great deal of time tracing back the many permutations of the "second most" statements to the <s>primary</s> secondary sources, and--when there are primary sources--it is always total export value that is listed in the <s>primary</s> secondary source, not contracts or some other measure (for example, nearly all U.S. mentions of this statistic can be traced back to is a CIA fact book from the late 1980's, which talks about export values).  If the statistic has changed from "most valuable" to "most traded" over the years, that just underscores how careless authors have become in checking their sources and expressing information accurately.  I do admit that I fell prey to this confusion as well in the way I titled this thread, and I have changed that, and I have a note below about how the Wiki might be changed to be more accurate.

I have already provided you with my source - the UN Food and Agriculture Organization - for data on the actual value of agricultural products sold.  Since coffee is below second in those rankings, then it follows that it is below second in the rankings of all commodities (agricultural and non-agricultural), regardless of what non-agricultural commodites may have a higher total value than the top agricultural commodity (wheat).  I don't have to know what the first and second commodities are--and I don't--to prove that coffee isn't second.  From the FAO I know that, at minimum, coffee is below wheat, soybeans, maize, palm oil, and sugar.  I.e., not second.  It also changes places nearly every year.

If you think there is some other definition of "most traded," please tell me what it is and we can go from there.  It is also possible to define it in terms of contracts traded, but this has more to do with speculation than it has bearing on the real importance of coffee trade, and this is not how most authors have been defining it.

I'm not using Google searches to prove that something's not true.  I used them to demonstrate how far this myth has spread, and how easy it is for a writer to find something to cite--even something that seems pretty official.  I have plenty of examples of peer-reviewed journal articles that say the same thing about coffee - and still confuse the terminology.  Wild almost certainly used one of these articles for the reference in his book (though we will never know).  And I have traced the citations in these articles to the <s>primary</s> secondary sources, and the sources are all fifteen or more years old.  I have asked researchers where they got their numbers, and they always give me sources that are either outdated themselves, or that cite sources that are.  So what I can say with confidence is this:  the people who are giving this number are not verifying their facts, and the market has changed dramatically since this statistic was first published.  It is too easy to accept something as common knowledge and repeat it, without taking the time to check.

Meanwhile, what is to be done about the Wiki page?  I didn't write the phrase "second most commonly traded commodity in the world," someone else did (which is why I titled thhe thread the way I did), but I changed some of the wording around it to show that it was not longer true.  But KP Botany is right, the wording is very confusing as "second most commonly traded" is not defined.  I am inclined to say it would be better to just delete the two sentences starting with "In some years in the 1980's. . ." leaving in the part about coffee being the seventh most valuable agricultural export in 2003.  I wanted to leave in the part about the "second most" not being true, because this is such a persistent myth, but prehaps the top paragraph is not the best place for this (though that was where the original sentence was).  I will also check Portillo (ref #4) tomorrow to see exactly what measurement he is referring to.  I am pretty sure it is actually export value.  If that is the case, it will be really easy to just change the sentence from "second most commonly traded commodity in the world (measured by monetary volume)" to "second most valuable export commodity."

By the way, KP Botany, just so you know in 1986, according to the FAO data, coffee actually WAS the #1 agricultural export crop in terms of value--above rice, wheat, soy and all the other big ones.  In 1987, 1994-95, and 1997-2000 it was second--just below wheat (but still not second to oil!).  My hypothesis is actualy that 1986 is where the original quotation came from.  I can't verify this, because I don't know what non-agricultural commodities may have been above coffee.    [[User:Margareta]] 03:52, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

Um...  wow.  Calm down, please.  I have not attacked you.  All I have done is try to understand the question you are asking, why you do not consider the UN Statistical Database an acceptable source, and what alternate definition of trade you are using that does not involve value of goods traded.  You are, of course, free to believe anything you like, but Wikipedia's policy is that all content must be [[verifiable.]]  Specifically, the policy is: "The obligation to provide a reliable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it."  In other words, you can't mke a categorical statement ("Coffee IS the second most traded commodity after oil") and then challenge others to prove you wrong.  You have to provide support for your statement.  The statement "Coffee IS the second most traded commodity after oil" is not verified and has no supporting data, and thus does not belong on Wikipedia.

:You can't and won't provide a quote or source.  Or, in other words, "Coffee IS the second most traded commodity after oil."  I got it.  Until you provide a quote or source, that's enough. [[User:KP Botany|KP Botany]] 20:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

The link is a database, so would not have "a single sentence" or list of top commodities.  However, I just went back to the Trade Statistics page ([http://faostat.fao.org/site/342/default.aspx]), and fortunately the FAO is now publishing selected statistics in tables (they weren't when I originally looked this up).  Until someone else provides an alternate one, I am taking as the definition of "most traded" the total value of exports worldwide.  Therefore:

From Table C.16 (http://www.fao.org/es/ess/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c16.pdf):
      Wheat $15.5 billion dollars
From Table C.19 (http://www.fao.org/es/ess/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c19.pdf):
      Sugar $10.0 billion dollars
      Coffee $6.5 billion dollars

Thus, regardless of what other commodities not listed in these tables may be above or between coffee, wheat, or sugar, coffee--being third in this list--cannot be second overall.

If you think there is another definition of trade that should be used, please provide it.  My justification for this definition is that the sentence I deleted, which said "Coffee is the second most commonly traded commodity in the world (measured by monetary volume), trailing only crude oil (and its products) as a source of foreign exchange to developing countries" cited a source (http://www.ico.org/coffee_story.asp) that actually says "It is one of the '''most valuable''' primary products in world trade, in many years '''second in value''' only to oil as a source of foreign exchange to developing countries"[emphasis added].  You can see that, besides the fact that the source actually talked about "most valuable," not "most traded," it also qualified the statement by saying "in many years," whereas the editor who cited it made the statement unqualified, and the "second to" clause only refers to developing countries, whereas the editor made the statement all-inclusive.[[User:Margareta|Margareta]] 20:54, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

== "Social Aspects of Coffee" ==

I wonder if this is the most appropriate title for a section talking about things like coffee houses.  "Social Aspects of Coffee" to me implies a section that will be talking about things like labor, effects of price swings, fair trade, etc.  I think it would be best to retitle this section something like "Coffee and Society" and add a new section called "Social and Environmental Concerns," where the instances mentioning things like "fair trade," "shade grown" coffee, organic, etc can be collected together into a coherent piece.  Or perhaps, inctead of having a separate section to talk about the history and importance of coffee in society, that information can be collected together under "Etymology and History."

== Phrasing improvement needed ... ==

Re: "Coffee is often enjoyed in different flavors, such as hazelnut, french vanilla, and Columbian, just to name a few."
I think that sentence should be recast for a couple of reasons, but am not coming up with the perfect phrasing myself yet, so perhaps someone else will.
1) Flavors may be added, but I don't think it quite scans to say that it's "enjoyed in different flavors." Unlike a popsicle or ice cream, coffee has a strong, dominating flavor all by itself; you might spice or otherwise add flavoring to steak, but you wouldn't say that "people enjoy steak in different flavors, such as peppercorn and A1 sauce." That sounds sarcastic, but I don't mean it to! Coffee can be flavored, but  I'd be a bit offput if a waitress asked "What flavor coffee would you like?" Is it just me?

2) "Columbian" isn't a "flavor" anyhow, is it? I'm not sure what was meant there.

[[User:Timothylord|timbo]] 04:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

:No, Colombian isn't a "flavour" (not to mention it was misspelled).  It's a '''brand''' promoted--very successfully--by the government of Colombia.  The name "Colombian milds" also refers to the highest-quality of the four varieties of coffee, but this type of coffee is (somewhat ironically) also grown in other countries, for example Kenya.  However, Colombian milds can be given any of the "flavours" that other types of coffee can.

:In any case, I don't really think the sentence on flavours is appropriate for a lead, and I've deleted it.  Perhaps it could be placed in [[Coffee#The_drink|The Drink]] if people feel it's important enough to keep in the article somewhere.--[[User:Margareta|Margareta]] 17:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

Currently there's a statement that says coffee had a big impact "throughout history."  The most universally accepted definition of the length of history is since the invention of writing, in the ballpark of 3000 BC.  Since coffee has only had a global impact in the last 500 years, aka the modern age (1500 to the present), I'm going to change it to reflect that.  I know that in other fields (art history, literature, etc), modern is defined differently.  In history is pretty accepted that modern starts at 1500.

:Ayup, vandalism. Fixed, thanks for noticing it! [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 12:25, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

The text gives the impression that English 'coffee' is derived from Kaffa (region in Ethiopia) whereas Arabic 'qahwa' means wine. English Coffee is however derived from Arabic (via Turkish 'kahveh') so there can be no difference in origin of 'coffee' and 'qahwa'. They either both mean wine or both are rooted in Kaffa.

I don't think the article makes it crystal clear that there is some question about the origins of the Arabic word. Would something along these lines be acceptable?

''"The English word "coffee" first came into use in the early to mid 1600s, but early forms date back to the last decade of the 1500s. The English term stems from the Italian "caffè" and the French, Portuguese and Spanish "café". These words were borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish "kahve", a derivation of the Arabic "qahhwa".''

''The origin of the Arabic "qahwa"'' (قهوة), ''is uncertain. It is either derived from the name of the 'Kaffa' region in southern Ethiopia, where coffee was cultivated, or by a truncation of "qahwat al-būnn", meaning "wine of the bean" in Arabic."''

I know this sounds dumb but does coffee prevent growth?[[User:69.221.247.31|69.221.247.31]] 02:20, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

So does all this mean that coffee doesn't prevent growth in humans on early stages like 1-13 year old children who are still developing?<span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.221.244.43|69.221.244.43]] ([[User talk:69.221.244.43|talk]]) </span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->

:Anonymous IP, I think it means either none of us know, or no one have the time to look it up for you.  It kind of sounds like an urban legend to me, but do you have a reference?--[[User:Margareta|Margareta]] 17:44, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

:As a devout coffee aficionado, I can submit that I've found no conclusive studies proving much of anything about coffee.  For every article touting health benefits of the drink, one could probably find an equal and opposite article espousing a counter opinion, with just as much "scientific research" behind it.  I suppose then that we could surmise that coffee articles follow the laws of thermodynamics rather well.  I started drinking coffee at the age of 13, and I am very close to the height of my own father, perhaps even an inch taller.  While hardly scientific, it does seem to indicate that such statements are nothing more than urban legends and old wivestales.  I was once told that it would turn my knees black in a couple of years, like they were permanently bruised.  Such has never occurred. [[User:CameronB|CameronB]]

== Headings and subheadings ==

It might just be me, but the names and organization of the headings and subheadings seem odd. For instance, "The plant", which has a single subheading, "Coffee seed types". Isn't it simpler to name the section "Coffee seed types", or just "Coffee seeds"? The second heading is "The drink". Isn't the article about the "widely consumed beverage prepared from the roasted seeds...of the coffee plant"? Then the subsection titles "Processing and roasting" and "Preparation" don't make it clear whether they talk about beans of the liquid beverage... I think the layout needs to be changed, just to make things more clear. Does anyone object? -[[User:Hey jude, don't let me down|Jude]] 20:11, 27 June 2007 (UTC)
:Good point about the focus of the article being on the drink, and about the singleton seeds section...maybe "Growing the bean" or "Coffee plants"? Then we could promote the "Processing and roasting" and "Preparation" subsections from the "The drink" up to being top-level sections. Sections 1-3 then progress along the steps from field to cup. The next three subsections of "The drink" ("Caffeine content", "Tasting", "Coffee with food") all seem to go together--all kinds of food-like qualities and related issues--so could leave them as subsections of...not sure what to call that section. Or make them subsections of the newly-promoted "Preparation" main section? [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 21:53, 27 June 2007 (UTC)
::The "Processing and roasting" and "Preparation" subsections could be top-level sections, as you suggested. Or, since there are 3 articles ("Coffee processing","Coffee roasting", and "Coffee preparation") which follow coffee from seed to beverage, these could be 3 subsections in a section about the creation of coffee? I agree that "Tasting", "Coffee with food", and "Caffeine content" all seem to go together. Something about the consumption of coffee?

:I agree that "the U.S colonies" is incorrect. But I think that "the American Colonies" is incorrect as well. They were hardly the only colonies in America. The French, the Dutch, and the Spanish all had colonies in the Americas at the time. Oh, and the Portuguese.

== Good Article nomination on hold ==

This article's Good Article promotion has been put on hold. During review, some issues were discovered that can be resolved without a major re-write.  This is how the article, as of August 1, 2007, compares against the  [[Wikipedia:What is a good article?|six good article criteria]]:

:'''1. Well written?:''' [[Image:Symbol wait.svg|15px]] The article mostly follows the [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]], but a few things need fixing.
* Later in the article, robusta and arabica are italicized as scientific names. This should probably be the same in the intro and the economics sections.
** Done. [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 17:19, 1 August 2007 (UTC)
** Some changes made: See my comments below.--[[User:Margareta|Margareta]] 18:46, 1 August 2007 (UTC)
* There was quite a bit of redundant word usage and phrasing, even within single sentences. The following sentence is an example of what I'm talking about: "Coffee berries and their seeds undergo multi-step processing before they become a beverage ready for consumption. The berries are picked, processed, and dried." Another instance is the first sentence of the intro's 2nd paragraph. As you've already disambiguated "coffee plant" in the first sentence, restating it is redundant. I'd suggest just removing it. This type of repetitive word use makes for a dry and uninspiring read. I've tried to clean some of it up and expand the vocabulary, but I would still like someone to go over the article with a fine-tooth comb for this.
**I corrected the examples you mentioned, as well as a few others. If I missed anything, just point it out and I'll correct it. --[[User_talk:Hey jude, don't let me down|Jude.]] 18:10, 2 August 2007 (UTC)
* The following sentence needs clarification. "its volume amounting to about a third of that of tap water in.." Does this mean the amount of tap water ''drunk'', or the amount of water in reservoirs altogether? Also, tap water should probably be changed to "municipal drinking water" for accuracy. This needs to be fixed in both the intro and the economics section, and stating it twice is again a redundancy that needs to be corrected.{{done}}
* Some disambiguation is needed throughout the article, examples include: Kraft, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, and Sara Lee, brewed (in the preparation section), pulp, starches, simple sugars (as one word?), and Sufi. In the preparation section, black should either be A. disambiguated if some article or page makes mention of the word's meaning in a coffee context or B. given some parenthetical or other expression of its connotation of  "with no additives". Or better yet, just begin with the simple definition and then say, "also colloquially known as "black"". {{done}}
* The sentence "Coffee has played a role in many societies throughout history" needs clarification. What kind of role? Anything that has existed has played some sort of role in history. At least try and assert the importance of the subject with an adjective like notable or important.{{done}} (changed to "important") {{done}}
* The last paragraph in the intro, about health effects, needs some grammar work, it's a bit cyclical. Saying its health effects has been questioned is a little bit off, it should probably say  controversial. {{done}}
* This sentence: "Physically, the bean shrinks in weight the beans are heated and moisture is lost" needs punctuation I believe. {{done}}
* The paragraph on the ecological impact of coffee-growing currently in the economics section needs to go in the cultivation section. I strongly suggest that instead of the pretty, but slightly pointless, close-up of the Brazilian plant in the Biology section, this image {{Image:Coffee Flowers Show.jpg}} of mono-cropped coffee be used to replace it. This would also be in accord with a move of the info on cropping methods to the proper section. Expanding the information on fair trade into its own paragraph is also in order, if possible.{{done}}
:'''2. Factually accurate?:''' [[Image:Symbol wait.svg|15px]] Mostly great, but I have just a few suggestions below.
* The edict against ''coffee'' led to the death of thousands of people? I know that wasn't it, but the end of the sentence about the Ottomans is confused. The mention of the deaths is trivial detail, as it doesn't actually have to do with social aspects of coffee.{{done}}
* While the article is usually very good about knowing when direct citations are necessary, the sentence about how "good quality robustas are used in some espresso blends..." needs a direct citation, if only bc the reason for doing so that the article presents is potentially controversial.{{done}}
* In the history section, "...coffee spread to Italy, according to historical sources." If you're going to say "according to" instead of citing the fact directly (a general one would be fine for this as well, as it is cited elsewhere), attributing it to unspecific sources is inappropriate. Better to name a particular credible historian.{{done}}
* Again in the history section, a general citation for most of the American history is fine, but the opinion that coffee was thought to be a "generally poor substitute for tea." needs to be directly cited. Anytime you assert the general tastes of a historical population of people there should be attribution.{{done}}
:'''3. Broad in coverage?:''' [[Image:Symbol wait.svg|15px]] Yes, but some expansion of the free trade movement is necessary. Simpy saying what it is, and when it started is insufficient. What has its affect, if any, been? What is its status and percentage of coffee sold today?{{done}}
:'''4. Neutral point of view?:''' [[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Well done.
:'''5. Article stability?''' [[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Yes.
:'''6. Images?:''' [[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Good, but please consider the change I suggested above.

Please address these matters soon and then leave a note here showing how they have been resolved.  After 48 hours the article should be [[Wikipedia:Good article candidates|reviewed again]].  If these issues are not addressed within 7 days, the article '''''may be failed without further notice'''''.  Thank you for your work so far.<!-- Template:FGAN -->

:Just a note about italicization of "arabica" and "robusta." Robusta is not a species name. Arabica coffee is ''Coffea arabica'' and has numerous varieties (e.g. "typica"). Robusta coffee is ''Coffea canephora'' var. ''robusta''. See, for example, the International Coffee Organization [http://www.ico.org/botanical.asp] and the USDA Plants Database [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=COAR2][http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=COCA39]. Nevertheless, varieties are italicized as well (when used to discuss the plant, but not the coffee itself). I'll try to make the necessary changes where "robusta" is referred to as a species.--[[User:Margareta|Margareta]] 17:23, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

The wording was the result of [[Talk:Coffee/Archive 2#"Most Consumed Beverage"|this discussion]], where "tap" is the wording used in the cited ref. I would presume that this term is being used fairly casually here, probably including well-water and other sources not really "municipal". The lead sentence wording does need help...the idea was to give an indication of how popular/important coffee is, leaving the details of it until later in the article. However, this lead sentence became detailed, technical, and cited (and hence redundant-looking) because editors didn't believe it was true otherwise. I'd love to hear suggestions for improved lead wording. [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] 17:19, 1 August 2007 (UTC)
:Okay, tap is fine then. But it still doesn't directly answer my primary question. I take it the study means tap water drunk. Is this correct?

== Economics section problems ==

Three things:
1. "A study in 2002 found that fair trade strengthened producer organizations, improved returns to small producers, and positively affected their quality of life and the health of the organizations that represent." This is obviously nonsense, but I can't tell what it's supposed to say.
2. The section mentions "tons" and "metric tons." In neither case does it matter which ton we're talking about, because the point is the ratio, not the amount (making conversion unnecessary). Still, the reader wants to know which of the six or so different kinds of ton he's being asked to care about, especially after having to switch to metric late in the section. What ton is being discussed in the first paragraph?
3. The jumping-bean initial caps in F(f)air T(t)rade are distracting at best. I can't tell when caps are appropriate, because I don't know the source material. I hope someone will sort that out and only use caps when talking about certification schemes. --[[User:Milkbreath|Milkbreath]] 12:19, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

:1. I'm not sure what you mean by it being nonsense, but the study it refers to is [http://www.fairtrade.net/uploads/media/ronchi_ft_impact_cococafe_costa_rica.pdf here].
:2. They're all metric tons. Should it say metric tons or metric tonnes? Does it matter at all?
:3. I put the two that talk about certification as "Fairtrade", and the others in lower case.
:Cheers, [[User_talk:Hey jude, don't let me down|Jude.]] 02:20, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

The problem is "organizations that represent." Represent what? On first reading, my first asinine thought was that a word had gotten chopped off the end, and it should be "organizations that represent them", but why should I care about the health of an organization, and how is that parallel to the quality of life of a Rwandan dirt farmer? That would be even worse nonsense. I just now followed that link you provide and searched the document for "organizations", hoping to find the identical broken English so I might understand it in context, but no go.

Thanks for fixing the other stuff. I'll sleep like a baby tonight, once my after-dinner cup of jamoke wears off. This is my favorite Wikipedia topic so far. --[[User:Milkbreath|Milkbreath]] 02:37, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

I agree with our anonymous friend that the English word "coffee" owes its final shape to the Italian, as do the other words for it in the Romance languages. He was right to edit the way he did. But I'm not sure that the matter is so clear-cut. The OED shows a kind of orthographic groping early on through such forms as chaoua and cahve, clearly English attempts to render the Arabic or Turkish directly, until the spelling "coffee" seems to snap into place around the middle of the 17th century. This rather sudden resolution, and not the word itself, is what seems to be due to the Italian word. --[[User:Milkbreath|Milkbreath]] 02:57, 9 August 2007 (UTC)

== Brewed vs. drip preparation methods ==

I don't understand the distinction between ''drip coffee'' and ''brewed coffee'' in the list of caffeine content for various preparation methods. I thought "brewing" coffee normally meant drip brewing? [[User:Hajhouse|hajhouse]] 05:55, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:For most Americans, this is true (since most brewed coffee in the U.S. is by the drip method). But there many many varied methods of brewing (which in the context of coffee and tea, simply means to mix with hot water) which do not connotate the drip method. [[User:VanTucky|'''Van<span style="color:#FF4F00">Tucky</span>''']] <sup>[[User talk:VanTucky|Talk]]</sup> 06:34, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

At thefreedictionary.com it defines brewed as:
"To make (a beverage) by boiling, steeping, or mixing various ingredients: brew tea."
and
"To be made by boiling or steeping: As the coffee brewed, I paced in the kitchen."
Today this is commonly called "steeped" in everyday language, because the boiling water and the grounds are mixed directly together like preparing a traditional proper tea.
Maybe the word "brewed" should be changed to the more accurate "steeped" as "brewed" seems to be common slang for making any type of coffee.

== Ammounts of Caffeine in drip Coffee ==

How is it possible that drip coffee has more caffeine than brewed? Assuming that the same grounds/amounts are used in both.
Please someone explain.
This seems physically impossible since drip comes in contact with the water for a couple seconds and brewed absorbs all it can from the grounds for approx. 3-5 minutes.
What is the scientific reason for this?
Also where are the amounts of caffeine listed refrenced from?
Please add a reference if possible.
Personally I have found brewed coffee to have more caffeine than drip. I have always found drip to be weakest of all 3 types.
I also noticed that the Espresso article states that Espresso coffee has twice the caffeine content than regular '''brewed''' coffee. This puts Espresso 1st, Brewed 2nd, and Drip 3rd. The article seems to make sense, is this true?

:With "brewed" (like in a cafetiere) coffee, the grind is normally much coarser than that used for "drip" coffee.  The finer a grind, the more surface area is in contact with the water, and so the more extraction that can happen.  I don't know which kind actually has more caffeine, but the coarseness could be a factor.
:Also, I think it's important to note that espresso has more caffeine per unit of liquid, but not necessarily more caffeine per beverage serving - that is, 1 ounce of espresso probably contains more caffeine than 1 ounce of drip coffee.  A typical espresso drink (at least in this region of the u.s.) has 1 or 2 1-ounce shots of espresso, for a total of ~150mg of caffeine, whereas a similar-sized drip coffee would probably contain closer to 350mg.

I notice that the numbers in ref 81 on caffeine content [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/caffeine/AN01211] do not match the numbers in the article.  That ref has:
* Caribou Cappuccino, 12 oz. 160-200
* Decaffeinated, instant, 8 oz. 2 mg
* Decaffeinated, brewed, 8 oz. 2
* Espresso, 1 fluid oz. 64
* Instant, 8 oz. 62
* Plain, brewed, 8 ounces (oz.) 95
* Starbucks Caffe Latte, 16 oz. 150
* Starbucks Coffee Grande, 16 oz. 330
Either the numbers or the refs need to be changed. [[User:Radagast3|Radagast3]] ([[User talk:Radagast3|talk]]) 09:05, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

At home, we keep regular and decaffeinated coffee in separate containers. Stored in the refrigerator, they will keep better. Usually we brew a 50/50 blend of both types at breakfast time.
Some retail food markets in the US have many types of coffee beans in bulk storage, where the customer can dispense his favorite one into a paper bag after which it gets dumped into a grinder. This enables one to have fresh ground coffee.

== etymology ==

*The word qahwa is an innate arabic word that was used for wine before the discovery of coffee, I have an old text about arabic named "omdat al-safwa fi hil alqahwa" it was mentioned somewhere in wikipedia as one of the oldest texts about coffee and it doesn't mention the "kaffa theory" at all.
*In arabic the name is "qahwat '''al-bun'''" also in amharic buno. in arabic the name "bun" is used for the plant wheras qahwat al-bun for the drink derrived from it.
*The word "qahwa" in arabic doesn't have a single similar letter with the word "kaffa", in arabic the letter ق ('''Q'''ahwa) is pronounced differently from the letter ك ('''K'''affa) and all the other letters are different.

I know this has been discussed before, there are 2 explanations:
#from the arabic word of qahwa.
#kaffa regoin.

I think we can say with certainty that the arabic word qahwa didn't originate from kaffa, there is no mention of that in any arabic source and the use of the word qahwa precedes the use of the invention of coffee. so it should be like this:
"coffee from It. caffe, from Turk. kahveh, from Arabic qahwah... Others claim ...kaffa..."

I tend to beliebve that it originated from qahwa and kaffa has nothing to do with it (a coincidence) but because of the similarity in '''English''' (not in Arabic) western scholars came up with this theory... but i have no source to back me on this. --[[User:Histolo2|Histolo2]] ([[User talk:Histolo2|talk]]) 10:29, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

== some suggestions for "health and pharmacology" section ==

{{tl|editsemiprotected}}
Dear Sir/Madam,

Although I am a registered user, I am unable to edit this page. That is fine but I have two suggestions to make of which one is very important. In "health and pharmacology" section, under "American scientist Yaser Dorri has suggested that the smell of coffee can restore appetite and refresh olfactory receptors. He suggests that people can regain their appetite after cooking by smelling coffee beans, and that this method might also be used for research animals.", I think the following changes should be made:

1) at the end, "...this method might also be used for animals in research institutes". It does not makes sense to say for research animals. it is not professional writing.

2) at the beggining, "....has suggested that the smell of coffee BEANS...."

I appreciate if you review my suggestions and change them if appropriate.

I am very interested to edit pages and I appreciate if that could be granted, if not now but over time.

Sincerely,

== Americano ? ==

I'd dispute the origin of the Americano in terms of chronology, but not in terms of broad accuracy. In late 70s Italy and France, it was extremely difficult to get a filter coffee - for those liking coffee with milk this was not a problem, however those from filter loving countries (UK, US, Germany, Scandinavia) found it hard to get a "black" coffee. Often ending up with a double espresso that was too strong to drink. By the late 80's it was easily possible to get a watered down Espresso which approximated to black filter coffee by asking for Cafe Americain (in France) or Caffe Americano - in Italy.

Im proposing a page that talks about how coffee drove so many aspects of society: science, invention, literature, politics, political theory, etc. And this argument does not root itself in anything silly like "caffeine makes you think" (though Voltaire consumed mythic amounts, 50 cups a day). At any rate, if you want me to do an artile on this post a heading and a go ahead. I wont bother with all the work unless there some degree of certainty that it will not all be deleted.

How is coffee associated with lower rates of type two diabetes? The disease has skyrocketed to epidemic proportions and most people drink coffee. How is it helping something that is skyrocketing in the big picture? Doesn't coffee increase stress hormones like cortisol and caused unbalanced blood sugar and eventually insulin resistance? Isn't the proven stress effect that coffee and caffeine creates reason enough to avoid it like the plague? Aren't people just so addicted to it that its use is defended with isloated silly studies or food or health police accusations when the fact of the matter is we are drinking a stress enhancing mood/mind altering roasted bean full of pesticides? Essentially junkies.

I know people who have quit smoking who cannot quit coffee - even when using a caffeine containing substitue like tea, never mind quitting caffeine. The reason - not the headaches, not the fatigue but the accompanying profound depression and constipation.

Coffee helps people to eat a diet that may not agree with them. It doesn't allow proper feedback to come from the food. Many people after eating wheat and dairy get fatigued but this effect is blocked or at least changed by the consumption of coffee or caffeine. The fatigue effect is a warming that food is not proper for the person. Instead of registering that effect, people cover it with a stress hormone drink like coffee, injuring themselves with the food and with the coffee in the long run.

I've heard studies about people over 40 that can increase their mental clarity and memory with some amounts of coffee.  Also, with the energy drink industry booming, it seems that increased metabolism is what people are asking  for.  Although it should be noted that a balanced and healthy food plan should be consumed with it.[[User:Neenbail|Neenbail]] 03:02, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:As far as the argument that diabetes rates are skyrocketing, so coffee must not prevent it, don't confuse correlation with causation. People are drinking more coffee, it's true. They're also eating more processed foods. They're also drinking more sugary beverages. They're getting less exercise. There are many more factors involved than just the drinking of coffee and the rates of diabetes. It's possible that if people didn't consume the amount of coffee that they do, rates would be even higher. Or not. More people are taking heart medications than ever, but the rates of death from heart disease are still high. It doesn't mean that the medications have no impact.

:The connection between consumption of coffee and lower risk of getting type two diabetes isn't connected to the caffeine in coffee; decaf coffee had the same benefits. Researchers have done numerous studies on the subject, but haven't isolated the substance in coffee which is responsible for the benefit. Your main argument seems to be against caffeine, butt caffeine is not the only compound in coffee that has an impact on health. However, if you haven't already, you might want to look at the [[Caffeine]] article, which discusses many negative effect of caffeine.

In the "Social" Section, the following is written:

"Studies conducted on Adventists have shown a small but statistically significant association between coffee consumption and mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all causes of death."

Surely coffee consumption cannot be proven to increase mortality from "ALL causes of death". How is it possible to research the link between absolutely every cause of death and coffee consumption? Car crashes, suicides, bomb attacks, for example, are all causes of death, but are unlikely to have been caused by coffee.

== What is "single origin" coffee? ==

I see the term "single origin" in several individual coffee pages here on Wikipedia, but no explanation of what "single origin" means. I gather that it means the coffee comes from just one place—but this term is presented by coffee shops and vendors who sell it as having a highly positive connotation, so I gather the term has a greater meaning than just "coffee from one place."

I can probably Google it and turn up half a dozen coffee vendors' pages explaining it, but it would be nice to have a neutral Wikipediaesque explanation in the article somewhere.

== Note to editors ==

'It is supposed that the Ethiopians, the ancestors of today's Oromo people,'

This cannot stand, since it reflects, or would reflect, an Oromo ethnic nationalism. The Oromo are one of several 'Ethiopian' ethnic groups. The line as it stands suggests that they are the original descendents of the people Homer called ''Aithiopes'' (Odyssey), unlike all other ethnic groups in Ethiopia today. The classical 'Ethiopian' is one thing, the several ethnic groups living in Ethiopia another. We do not know if the Oromo were the autochthones referred to by Homer and Herodotus, etc.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 23:15, 30 December 2009 (UTC)

:::I could give you the ethnology, but the point is not strictly ethnological. 'Ethiopians' is a (a)generic term for a modern nation's varied population, constituted of different ethnic groups but (b) it is an historic term going back to antiquity, rooted in mythological cosmology, and was used later to refer to the Nubians. The Nubians speak a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language, while Oromo is [[Cushitic]]. So throughout antiquity the 'Ethiopians' were mythical, or 'Nubians', then later the the [[Amhara]] who spoke a language from a third linguistic group ([[south Semitic]]). The RS implied that the Oromo were the people that until recent centuries, Western or classical sources on Ethiopians understood to be what we now call either Nubians or the Amharic peoples of Ethiopia.
:::That is why I re-edited according to the source quoted, altering it to remove this slippery and dangerous equivocation. Unfortunately (and my insistence on this in the past has occasionally gotten me into hot water by editors who refuse to understand the difficulty) often very good sources get things wrong, or phrase things badly when the scholars writing them draw on material outside their specific area of competence, and this has happened here. While a wiki editor is not supposed to note when a RS gets things wrong, or uses misleading phraseology, at the same time, an editor who cares for the quality of his text should exercise commonsense and close judgement, by not following verbatim an RS that slips up (the endless argument I was compelled to make on using Walter Laqueur on the Qur'an: Laqueur is RS, but he got things drastically wrong on a point of textual citation).

:::To repeat what the RS says is to endorse an ideology, against the known facts of African history and ethnography,  that one modern and major ethnic group, the Oromo, constitute the essence or heart of Ethiopian culture, and tradition, as opposed to the other populations which, by this slipshod use of language, are made out to be 'intruders' without the same long historical roots in that country.

One way to look at this is that the sourcebook on coffee might very well be a secondary source on coffee, but that the topic of Ethiopian ethnographic history is probably tertiary (i.e. probably taken verbatim from some other source) - hence a secondary source can be said to trump this (tertiary) source when it comes to ethnography, and a peer-reviewed one better still.

::The text reads:-

::'Coffee became the substitute beverage in spiritual practices where wine was forbidden.[citation needed] Coffee drinking was briefly prohibited by Muslims as haraam in the early years of the 16th century, but this was quickly overturned.'
::(a)Citation needed = Ken Albala, ''Food in early modern Europe,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 p.84

::(b)Haraam should be d wikilinked = [[Haraam]]

::(c)On the final sentence, perhaps the technical details are useful.
:::<blockquote>‘God, for instance, was widely known to have prohibited wine, or, to be more precise, a beverage which the Qur’ān called ''khamr'', the definition of which was a matter of disagreement. If the reason for the divine proscription on khamr was found to be in its intoxicating properties, then the prohibition might be extended, by application of ''qiyā'', to other intoxicants. This was exactly the approach that some jurists took, arguing that any intoxicant was forbidden by analogy with khamr.</blockquote>
:::<blockquote>The jurists gathered in Mecca in 1511 were apparently open to such an argument: if coffee could be shown to be intoxicating, it must be forbidden. They were aided by a linguistic peculiarity. The word ''qahwa'', used for coffee, was also one of the words used for wine. In the end their final decision did not rest on a systematic argument linking coffee and wine. There were others willing to take up such a position, however. The argument for prohibition of coffee by analogy with wine must have had proponents, since defenders of coffee offered vigorous refutations. The reasoning adopted by the Meccan council of [[ulama|‘ulamā’]] turned out to be more pallid. Coffee was prohibited simply because it is vaguely harmful to one’s well-being.</blockquote>
:::<blockquote>Although the assembled jurists of Mecca had reached their verdict, however, that was hardly the end of the matter. Anti-coffee jurists very soon had to face the inconvenient fact that other jurists, and as it turned out, more influential ones, disagreed with their decision. What the Meccan jurists had arrived at, in other words, was not God’s law in an objective sense, but simply their own understanding of God’s law. No Muslim jurist would doubt that God had an opinion about coffee, but most of them shared a healthy sense of their own fallibility in understanding his opinions. They could only do their best, and their best might not be enough. This process of seeking to understand God’s law the legal scholars called [[fiqh]] – understanding. Scholars who engaged in this process were fuqahā’. Fiqh and the rulings that resulted from it were, at best, an approximation of the true law of God, and the pro-coffee lobby was free to argue that the assembled Meccan ‘ulamā’ had gotten it quite wrong.’ Daniel W. Brown,''A new introduction to Islam,'' Wiley-Blackwell, 2004 pp.119-120</blockquote>

::Just as a piece of trivia, finally, re the Oromo and coffee. Until recently it was customary for the Oromo to plant a coffee tree on the graves of particularly powerful sorcerers.

::*OK, I've excerpted some of the content into my userspace at [[User:Agradman/coffee]], and I'll now start integrating it.

== "origin" of coffee -- Yemen v. Ethiopia (?) ==

An anonymous user has made a good-faith change of the origin from "Yemen" to "Ethiopia".  I just wanted to acknowledge that this difference stems from ambiguity over whether we're discussing:
#The "origin" of the bean -- this would be ridiculous to characterize, and no one has attempted it -- it probably grew all over Africa.
#The "origin" of human uses of the bean -- which originate with the Galla tribe of Ethiopia (apparently)
#The "origin" of consumption of the bean as a beverage -- Yemen.

I don't have a position either way on how we resolve this, but I think that if there's controversy over this, we should make an effort to ensure that every mention of the phrase "origins" makes perfectly clear which of the notions is being referred to.

I'll float the idea of splitting this page into
#[[coffee]] =  redirect from [[coffee (beverage)]]
#[[coffee (bean)]]

:First sentence of the article reads "'''Coffee''' is a [[brew]]ed [[drink|beverage]] prepared from roasted [[seed]]s, commonly called [[coffee bean]]s, of the [[Coffea|coffee plant]].", so the scope here is specifically the drink and we already have a separate article specifically about the beans. Given that, we should be consistent here for the use/topic at hand, not preceding different uses. I would support inclusion of historical information about how the drink was a later development from some other food preparation (assuming [[WP:V]] info) (if the actual continuum is known), but that's definitely background about a topic different from the one focus of this page.

== Production ==

The figures given in the table are totally inconsistent. The three biggest producers produce more coffee '''each''' (17M, 15M and 9M tonnes), than the total world production (7M tonnes). The FAO page gives 2M tonnes for Brazil and 0.9M tonnes for Vietnam for 2007. Somehow I doubt that coffee production multiplied itself by 8 in Brazil and by 17 in Vietnam from 2007 to 2008. If these figures are not revised, I will substitute them for the FAO numbers for 2007. &mdash; [[User:Isilanes|isilanes]] ([[User_talk:Isilanes|talk]]|[[Special:Contributions/Isilanes|contribs]]) 10:09, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

== the place where coffee originated. ==

in the Wikipedia about coffee, the birth place of coffee is stated to be Oromia.
but according to many European Historians who visited the place at that time the birth place of coffee is the Province of Kaffa which is in the south west of Ethiopia and currently the country also recognized this fact and a museum is being built in that place. Actually, the Province of Kaffa is very close to Oromia and that might has caused this error. The name relations of Kaffa and Coffee also strengthens this fact.([[Special:Contributions/213.55.75.65|213.55.75.65]] ([[User talk:213.55.75.65|talk]]) 08:06, 22 September 2009 (UTC))

:As I understand, [[Oromia]] since 1995 includes the [[Kaffa_Province,_Ethiopia|former Kaffa Province]]. Moreover, according to the reference [http://books.google.com/books?id=Qyz5CnOaH9oC&pg=PA3&dq=coffee+goat+ethiopia+Kaldi&lr=&ei=paxHStuDJ4XuzATj97hf], the first to recognize and use coffee where the ancestors of the Galla tribe (a now perceived as pejorative term used by non-Oromo Ethiopians for the [[Oromo_people|Oromo People]]), probably in the region of Ethiopia that was to become later the province of Kaffa. Therefore, I think it is correct to talk of the ancestors of the [[Oromo_people|Oromo People]], without any contradiction (as in a previous version of the article).

:I will make this change in the history of coffee section (somewhat harmonizing with [[History_of_coffee|History of coffee]]), but I will be mildly bold and try to simplify and shorten the lead, instead of putting it there too. I think there is no need for unclear details about the history of coffee in the introduction, since this section has been changed back and forth for this reason.

====Language====
Kudos to Cas for trying to get dates consistent. At present there is a mixture of DD-MM-YYYY (en-gb), MM-DD-YYYY (en-us), and YYYY-MM-DD (pseudo-ISO). I was about to start overhauling those dates, but then I realised it would be sensible to establish consensus first on whether the article should be written in UK-english or US-english. If we examine the guidance at [[WP:MOSDATE]]: {{quote|If an article has been stable in a given style, it should not be converted without a style-independent reason. Where in doubt, defer to the style used by the first major contributor}} we get a difficulty. The article still contains a mix of "flavour" and "flavor", for example. The first major contributor to distinguish between UK- and US-english used "flavour" ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=next&oldid=3247071 diff]), but the article has gradually drifted to a majority US-english use. Can we reach a consensus here that we go with US-english (as that requires least work for consistency)? or should we abide by the guidance in MOSDATE and restore spellings and dates to UK-english? I'm happy with either decision, but as I still bear the scars of [[WP:ARBDATE]], I'd rather see some consensus before I start wholescale changing of spellings and dates for consistency. Any advice welcome. --[[User:RexxS|RexxS]] ([[User talk:RexxS|talk]]) 23:43, 2 January 2010 (UTC)

====Biology section====
Since Cas asked my opinion on the biology section, I thought I'd throw out a few thoughts.

* Since the history section is before the biology section, it's a bit strange to see the native range of coffee mentioned ''after'' the story of its discovery and domestication.  It gets a little more problematic since the daughter articles (''[[Coffea arabica]]'' and ''[[Coffea canephora]]'') give native ranges that don't include Ethiopia. ''(fixed)''
**We either need to move the biology section up before the history section or mention explicitly what species we're talking about in the history section (and, ideally, fix the contraction between this article and the ''C. arabica'' article. ''(fixed)''
**For that matter, how did ''C. canephora'' come to be cultivated? ''(see para 2 of ''''Cultivation''' section - could add that it had been traditionally chewed in Uganda too)''
* Since we discuss shade versus sun coffee, we need to talk a little bit about the underlying physiology.
* I think it's important to mention where the inflorescences are formed - clearly they're axillary, not terminal - and the type of inflorescence.
* Although the flowers are described as "fragrant", there's nothing on their pollination mechanism and whether they're self-pollinating or cross-pollinating.  This is important in explaining their successful spread around the world. ''(<s>each of the main species does one - will add</s> now added)''
* Domestication and breeding - there's nothing on either of these (very important) topics.  Domestication may belong in the history subsection.  But the difference between crop species and their wild ancestors is important.  In addition, are wild relatives used in coffee breeding?  Are there hybrids between ''C. arabica'' and ''C. canephora''?  (This may belong in the cultivation section)
* Disease - what are the major pests and pathogens?  How are they managed?  (This may belong in the cultivation section) ''(wow, there's a lot of info  - added some on pests)''

Good points - also on flow of article - I just realised [[Saffron]] flows the same way. Furthermore, I am finding alot of material in ''history'' is overlapping with the bottom social/cultural bit. Hence I believe this reordering is helped greatly by slotting ''history'' down the article (much like medical articles really).

====Other comments====
Since I'm here, I noticed that the "Processing" section begins with "Roasting", and although the 'pre-roasting' processing is mentioned, it appears that only wet process and not dry process fermentation is mentioned.  In addition, shouldn't the decaffination process be mentioned here, since that is also done pre-roasting?

:'''Update''' - the ''Processing'' section needs to be overhauled  - have been reading about it and we really need to structure it like the subarticle [[Coffee processing]]  - the wet and dry methods are very important to define.

:Elderly individuals with a depleted enzymatic system do not tolerate coffee with caffeine. They are recommended to take decaffeinated coffee, and this only if their stomach is healthy, because both decaffeinated coffee and coffee with caffeine cause heartburn. Moderate amounts of coffee (50–100 mg of caffeine or 5–10 g of coffee powder a day) are well tolerated by most elderly people.

The amount of caffeine in coffee and tea varies based on brewing times and methods. General guidelines for beverage caffeine content include the following:

Brewed coffee (8 oz) - 120 mg
Instant coffee (8 oz) - 70 mg

== green coffee? ==

what exactly is meant by "green coffee"? The article refers to it in several places, most notably in the second sentence of the lead, but doesn't really define what it is. Is it some kind of coffee produced in an "environmentally-friendly" manner, or something?

Also, regarding the 'citation needed' tag in the ''production'' sub-section, I think it's evident from the table that Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are the top three producers of coffee. Why is coffee in Colombia "softer", and why is it being described as such? Not sure where we're going to find a citation for that -- I tried a few google searches but got nowhere. The softer coffee remark could probably be deleted, IMHO. [[User:Wiki.Tango.Foxtrot|WTF]] ([[User talk:Wiki.Tango.Foxtrot|talk]]) 15:44, 6 January 2010 (UTC)

== Changed the photo ==

When I was wiki-gnoming at this page back in August, I saw a number of people confusing this article for the article on the [[coffee bean]].  This caused, for example, some erroneous statements in the history section (e.g., that coffee has been used since prehistoric times).  Around that time, I added the hatnote, that ''"This article is about the beverage.  For the bean, see [[coffee bean]]."''

To further clarify, I just substituted [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&action=historysubmit&diff=336265932&oldid=336264911] this photo of the beverage [[File:A small cup of coffee.JPG|80px|alt=A cup of coffee.]] for the picture of coffee beans, [[File:Roasted coffee beans.jpg|80px]].  This reverses [[user:Casliber|Casliber's]] revision of a week ago. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=next&oldid=334702921].  I'll mention it to that person now.

== Coffee refreshes the scent receptors or not ==

I have removed the following from the section ''Health and pharmacology'':
 Many high-end perfume shops now offer coffee beans to refresh the receptors between perfume tests.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
An online search leads me to believe that [http://jmjvasanthkani.blogspot.com/ this blog] may be the originator. However, the author claims "I have experienced this is [sic] Chennai Pothys, while I was looking for a good perfume". As far as I'm able to ascertain, Pothys doesn't [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Awww.pothys.com+perfume seem to sell perfume] and the [http://www.pothys.com/profile.htm Chennai showroom sells clothing] - I'm not certain about that, but it doesn't seem to be enough to elevate this claim above 'urban legend', imho. In addition, the book ''What the Nose Knows - The Science of Scent in Everyday Life'' by Avery Gilbert (ISBN-13: 978-1400082346) contradicts the notion that coffee beans refresh the scent receptors (book review [http://www.basenotes.net/articles/20080610what-the-nose-knows.html here]). [http://averygilbert.com/ Dr Avery Gilbert] seems to have some reputation as an expert on scent, so I'm inclined to give weight to that view.

== Kahveh vs kahve ==

Regarding the distinction between ''kahveh'' and ''kahve'' allow me to draw attention to the article "[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s10-XII/291/64-b 'Coffee': Its etymology]" from ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' (1909):
<blockquote>The history of this word involves several phonetic difficulties hitherto unsolved. Of course the ' N.E.D.' is right in stating that the European languages got the name about 1600 from the Arabic ''qahwah'', not directly, but through its Turkish form ''kahveh''. The Turkish form might have been written ''kahvé'', as its final ''h'' was never sounded at any time.</blockquote>
Is that sufficiently clear? [[User:Gabbe|Gabbe]] ([[User talk:Gabbe|talk]]) 15:00, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

:I'm happy with either. That's a perfectly good source to support the 'kahveh' spelling from 1909. The other view would of course be that it is an early attempt to romanise a Turkish word, but it is now romanised in modern Turkish as 'kahve' (cf. [[tr:Kahve]]). I can't see an overwhelming argument either way, but from a practical point of view, I'd guess every Turkish viewer is likely to want to delete the final 'h'! --[[User:RexxS|RexxS]] ([[User talk:RexxS|talk]]) 16:26, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

== Refs in History ==

I've just finished checking the refs in ''History'' section and I was disappointed by the lack of correlation between the older refs and the text they supported. It's almost as if some of the old text had been lifted or written off the top of the editor's head, and then sources found that tangentially mention part of the text. I've corrected what I can, but the main remaining concerns are:
* "From Ethiopia, coffee was said to have spread to Egypt and Yemen."
* "When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe."
* "During the Revolutionary War, however, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically;"
* "After the War of 1812, during which Britain temporarily cut off access to tea imports, the Americans' taste for coffee grew"
* "... high demand during the American Civil War together with advances in brewing technology secured the position of coffee as an everyday commodity in the United States."
Assuming those are factual, we need to find some better sources to support the detail there.

Ought we to find a source to directly support "It has become the primary export and backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda ..." ? --[[User:RexxS|RexxS]] ([[User talk:RexxS|talk]]) 21:20, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

An IP editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&curid=604727&diff=351249334&oldid=351162864 added] the following:
* "Studies have also indicated that the removal of diterpenes accelerates dihydrotestosterone in men, which is thought to be responsible for male pattern baldness. Usually triggered by a combination of hormonal activity and heredity, which together cause the hair follicles in the scalp to shrink, there exists a positive association between coffee consumption and baldness in men. According to a research team headed by the American Medical Association (AMA), this process has been observed to take place as early as the age of 17 in young males."

== Misleading Prohibition Statistics for the Seventh-day Adventist Church ==

The Prohibition section cites [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0887/is_n9_v11/ai_12673616 this article], but in the context, it seems like it's implying that Seventh-day Adventists are more susceptible to coffee's adverse health effects.  The research seems to have more to do with the group's prohibition being used as a statistically clean sample population.  I think this information belongs in the Health section where it isn't quite as misleading.

[[User:Quartz25|Quartz]] ([[User talk:Quartz25|talk]]) 02:42, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that an unwarranted implication exists in that text. Nevertheless I still think that it's an interesting example of abstinence/prohibition that works better in its present context than in the Health section (since the results only show a weak effect). As a compromise, I've re-written that paragraph to try to make it clearer that Adventists are considered as a clean sample, rather than having an increased susceptibility. I'm still not 100% satisfied, but please feel free to improve on my efforts if you can. --[[User:RexxS|RexxS]] ([[User talk:RexxS|talk]]) 03:29, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

::That's much better than I could have thought of.  Thanks!  [[User:Quartz25|Quartz]] ([[User talk:Quartz25|talk]]) 03:41, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

Personally, I think it should be removed entirely. First off, citing one study out of probably hundreds done on SDA groups as evidence of coffee being harmful is spurious. What about the other studies done on the SDA? To not note that the other studious found no correlation is intellectually dishonest and misleading. It should have been qualified with, "But only one study..." If it takes only one study to to make the inclusion of the information within into an article valid, every wikipedia page would be filled with paragraph after paragraph of frivolous info. I'm sure there is a single study that claims chewing gum causes global warming or something as equally as frivolous. Does that mean that particular info should be included into the article about gum? Second, even if the Adventists observed refrained from alcohol and smoking (and how can you even know that for sure, they could be fibbing about that so as to not get into trouble) there are still many, many confounding factors. For example there is age, genetics, sex, race, diet, exercise and many, many more. To imply that SDA church members somehow constitute a "pure" sample and "completely free" from confounding factors just because they abstain from smoking and drinking is incredibly fallacious. Also, if they refrain from smoking and drinking, how can we know for sure that it's not those factors that contribute to them being supposedly healthier? The study just could have easily concluded that there is a "weak but statistically significant association" (more on that dubious phrase later) between alcohol intake or tobacco intake and "mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all causes of death." Also, "all causes of death????" That's incredibly clunky phrasing, what does coffee intake have to with causes of death like being drowned, falling from a height, being electrocuted, being stabbed to death and the like? And do we need to say "all cardiovascular diseases combined" and "other cardiovascular disease?" Isn't that redundant? Not to mention vague as hell.

Also, the language and use of words is troubling. The study is described as "being able to show," this is very NPOV. Unless you are God and know for sure that study is 100% accurate, the best you can say is that the study "claims" to show. Studies are based on subjective human observation and conclusions, and can't be taken as gospel. "Being able to show" is absurdly over authoritative. Second, the phrase "weak but statistically significant association" is pure double talk. How can it be weak and also at the same time "statistically significant"? One precludes the other. That's like saying "that man is weak, but strong!" It makes no sense. It seems to me their is an agenda here, namely to try and saddle coffee as being bad for your health. If you're going to do that, fine, there are many views on that issue, but I cry foul when one very shaky and dubious study is used to further that claim.

P.S. I'm not implying Rexss that you intentionally are trying to push an anti-coffee message, but your re-write sure didn't help.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.205.59.37|68.205.59.37]] ([[User talk:68.205.59.37|talk]]) 07:46, 31 July 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:That's ok - no offence taken; I'm just disappointed that I wasn't able to make a better job of writing for you. Let's see if we can identify your concerns, then see how we can address them:
:*You feel that citing "Coffee consumption and mortality in Seventh-Day Adventists" out of hundreds done on SDA groups is spurious. Perhaps you could suggest some of those other studies that would be worth including. I usually find the solution is consider more sources to provide balance and I'd be happy to do so.
:*You raise the problem of confounding factors, but wouldn't you agree that taking into account the factors you suggest is a well understood statistical technique? As long as your sample contains significant numbers of examples of each, then any such effect can be estimated. For example, if the sample contains roughly equal numbers of men and women, then analysis can estimate the magnitude of effect that gender has on mortality from ischemic heart disease. The problem is that smoking in particular has a huge effect and is likely to swamp any weak effect (more on that later). Finding a population (SDA) that is virtually free of the effects of tobacco – as a matter of choice, not necessity – is what makes this study so sensitive, and allows it to examine factors which would be lost in the statistical noise that tobacco causes. This study is a 25-year follow-up with a sample size close to ten thousand on a population free of the principal confounding factor. I think that gives it sufficient credentials to distinguish it from many other studies looking at factors affecting ischemic heart disease.
:*You find the quote from the study clunky. Well yes, it does read awkwardly and I'd be happy to see a better formulation. The study concluded that they could show four associations: (coffee consumption – mortality from ischemic heart disease); (coffee consumption – mortality from other cardiovascular disease); (coffee consumption – mortality from all cardiovascular diseases combined); (coffee consumption – all causes of death). That's a statistical association, not a demonstration of causality, so it is certainly does not imply that drinking coffee causes people to be stabbed to death.
:*I'd be happy to find a better phrase than "was able to show", but the point is that ''this'' study was capable of showing an association, because it eliminated the principal confounding factors.
:*I'm sorry but I have to simply dismiss your concerns that the study subjects might have been lying, or that smoking is good for your health.
:*Finally the phrase "weak but statistically significant association" is perfectly reasonable. What it is saying is that people who drink coffee have a very slightly higher empirical chance of death in a particular period than those that don't consume (a weak association); and that the study researchers are quite confident about the result (a statistically significant association). Perhaps it needs to be explained in full, but I'm not sure how much more space should be devoted to attempting to explain statistics in a page about coffee. --[[User:RexxS|RexxS]] ([[User talk:RexxS|talk]]) 12:18, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

Essentially the water usage for wet processing arabica coffee is the sum total of all operations (up to 6 in all) in a pulping/washing station which require processing water and produce wastewater.  A number of articles analyze pulping systems and seem to ignore the other points of water consumption. Thus comparison between systems is not easy. The attached table sets out water consumption for the McKinnon-Agaard wet processing system widely used in East Africa (3,500 plus washing stations) with a breakdown and summary of water consumption.  Most of the private sector washing stations have a full recirculation system.  The data here may be quoted and used freely.

The first sentence refers to coffee being bitter. Colloquially, this might be true (especially with poor quality beans), but in food tasting circles it is not.

Depending on the specific plant breed the the coffee is grown on, the coffee produces a different flavour.  Sometimes, it can be more "fruity" and sometimes more "nutty".  I read about the different ways coffee connoisseurs describe coffee flavour, and am interested about the characteristics and tastes each type of bean produces.  I think there can be greater explanation on the types of coffee and the taste each type produces.

The table in this section is dubious. It talks about espresso as "fine grind". Absolutely not! Espresso demands a medium/coarse grind.

:Wrong on two counts! Espresso is neither made from coarse ground nor with steam. See the WP espresso page, which says: "Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of '''nearly boiling water''' under pressure through '''finely ground coffee''' beans."  I can personally attest to this since I've made over 4,000 shots of espresso using commercial equipment.[[User:Dan Bollinger|Dan Bollinger]] ([[User talk:Dan Bollinger|talk]]) 21:20, 28 June 2012 (UTC)

== Acidic, not bitter ==

I have changed this once before adding my rationale here. If coffee tastes bitter, it is only because cheap beans were poorly prepared. Chefs call coffee a sweet beverage. I once again removed "bitter" and replaced it with "slightly acidic" and this time included a reference. To give you an idea of just how nearly neutral coffee's pH is, if you diluted vinegar to the same pH level as coffee (5.0-5.1) you could not taste the vinegar in the water.  Studies have recorded a "perceived" acidity by coffee drinkers, but this has been attributed to flavors, not acids, and to coffee's aroma.

::I understand, and one person's opinion does not a fact make. Coffee's acidity is very low, you need litmus paper to measure it. I've read about the so-called bitterness in a peer-review article that dismisses the "bitterness" claim, but could not find it to cite in my edits last week. One of the problems is that bitterness is subjective. I'll keep looking so we can perfect this article. Just so you know, acidity is what lay people call sour. Technically, sourness comes from fermentation, typically the bacteria ''acetobacter''.  [[User:Dan Bollinger|Dan Bollinger]] ([[User talk:Dan Bollinger|talk]]) 15:40, 5 July 2012 (UTC)

Hello, I was the one who made the flavor addition in the first place, a while back. Before my edit there was no mention of the flavor. Acidic is not a flavor. Sour, bitter, savory, salty, sweet, et cetera are flavors. The bitterness of coffee comes from the roasting process. I am restoring my original description, that coffee has a dark, bitter flavor. If you disagree with the characterization of dark, I will find a few sources by flavor connoisseurs and refute you.

I reverted this yesterday [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=505332562&oldid=505324736] but has now been added back in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=next&oldid=505332562]. Some people may perceive a 'dark' character to the taste of coffee, but this is a poetic description (possibly caused by a type 1 mixing up of the visual and taste senses). As figurative language it has no place in the lead sentence of an encyclopedic article. In the same way that wine experts mostly can't tell red from white wine in blind tastings if coffee was asked to be described blind from amongst other substances I would expect the descriptions to be all over the place. We can describe the color plainly but should avoid figurative descriptions of taste. <small>[[User:SkyMachine|<font color="black">'''''Sky'''''</font><font color="darkgreen">'''''Machine'''''</font>]]</small> [[User talk:SkyMachine| <sup>(<font color="SteelBlue">'''++'''</font>)</sup>]] 20:23, 2 August 2012 (UTC)

:I said a few words on this in the section above. Wine experts can discern white and red wine by taste; if they can't, who's the expert? Dark is not a figurative description of taste, it is a matter of how roasted the stock of a brewed beverage is. Coffee tastes dark--tea does not, because the tea leaves are not roasted. Pale ale doesn't taste dark--but porter and stout do, because the malt is roasted. Milk chocolate tastes creamy--but dark chocolate does not. The visual appearance is irrelevant.

::Some people want to be fooled. That is fine for them but this is an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia can introduce subjective opinions but only if they are sourced to reliable secondary sources. A wine expert is like a priest or witch doctor in that they don't have to be good in what they purport to be experts in, they merely have to sell the appearance of being good at this by mystery-mongering to their gullible marks (see [[Wine tasting#Blind tasting]]). People use [[Availability heuristic|availability bias]]es and other [[heuristics]] to come up with subjective descriptions of sensory phenomena. As regards to your chocolate example the difference there is in texture (or mouth feel), not taste, thus you have again made this same error by mixing the sensation of touch with that of taste.  <small>[[User:SkyMachine|<font color="black">'''''Sky'''''</font><font color="darkgreen">'''''Machine'''''</font>]]</small> [[User talk:SkyMachine| <sup>(<font color="SteelBlue">'''++'''</font>)</sup>]] 04:32, 3 August 2012 (UTC)

:::Dark chocolate tastes substantially different from milk chocolate, while actually having a very similar mouthfeel apart from from being slightly more brittle. I used the word ''creamy'' in reference to the flavor or milk or cream. If you are seriously contesting that dark and light, or dark-bodied and light-bodied, are inaccurate characterizations of flavor, please see here: [[Coffee roasting#Roast flavors]]. The flavor column makes substantial reference to dark and light flavor. And actually, there are a couple mentions of the mouth-feel, which you contend has nothing to do with flavor, but others clearly disagree.

::::These others that disagree have fallen prey to the same biases that you have. The use of ''taste'' in that table is sloppy, the meaning of it used there is 'sensations experienced while consuming' which includes many senses interwoven(taste, smell, temperature, mouth feel, texture, sound, crispness etc). I do not argue that different things don't have different tastes, I argue that descriptions of these tastes are massively subjective and prone to suggestibility, and that it is best to leave these out. <small>[[User:SkyMachine|<font color="black">'''''Sky'''''</font><font color="darkgreen">'''''Machine'''''</font>]]</small> [[User talk:SkyMachine| <sup>(<font color="SteelBlue">'''++'''</font>)</sup>]] 21:34, 3 August 2012 (UTC)

The lead of this article is no place for an editor to be expressing their personal opinions about flavours and I've restored the previous "strong" description which enjoyed consensus for some time.

::::::: Are we speaking the same language? A "strong flavour" is a perfectly meaningful English phrase, and is the phrase used in this article for a considerable time. The reason for that was that no consensus could be found for how people perceived the flavour of coffee. I have no problem with "bitter" as a flavour, but do not agree that it is characteristic of all coffee - which can can be prepared to exhibit a wide range of flavours. I do object very strongly to "robust" which is meaningless advertising jargon and has no place in an encyclopedia. Now you need to find some source that backs up your use of "bitter, robust" or put back the version that was in place before you started edit-warring your personal opinions into the lead of a major encyclopedic article. In the meantime, I've removed mention of flavour from the lead pending some consensus being formed. Let's indeed come to a consensus before you think about re-inserting your unsupported personal opinions.

::::::::Your confrontational attitude is unproductive. Please don't accuse of engaging in an edit war; this is your read, and not my intent. As a coffee lover, I originated the discussion on flavor by inserting a characterization of it. An encyclopedic article about a beverage ''must'' comment on its flavor. Regional variations in coffee preparation lead to a large variety of flavor bundles and different ways of thinking about coffee. So I have described it as a brewed beverage with a "distinct aroma and flavor," which is sufficiently broad so as to please all of you.

== Cleaning up "Health and pharmacology" section ==

So, there's a bit of an issue with the organization on the information contained in the "Health and pharmacology" section of this article. Namely, the boundaries are blurred between this and a few other articles, causing information to be both excluded and redundantly published. The two articles that most directly overlap with this section are the following:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_coffee

There is no obvious solution to the redundancy of the Health section of this article and the Health effects article, so anyone that can find guidance in the Wikipedia documentation should definitely let us know. I'll start migrating some of the details that more obviously belong in the Health effects article, give a brief but more explicative mention of caffeine's effects in the Coffee article, and look for a way to link to the Health effects article in the coffee article. However, I'm still very much a newb at Wikipedia editing, so any help, input, and guidance would be greatly appreciated.

The presence of [[4-Caffeoyl-1,5-quinide]] in coffee is IMO notable enough to be included somewhere in the article "even without reference to any effects on humans".

== Etymology ==

''"In English and other European languages, coffee derives from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, via the Italian caffè. The Turkish word in turn is derived from the Arabic: قهوة‎, qahwah."''

Coffee is derived from Italian, which derives from Ottoman Turkish, which derives from Arabic? If this is true, it needs to be written more clearly. Perhaps something like:

"In English and other European languages, coffee descends from the Italian word: caffè. In turn, caffè derives from the Ottoman Turkish word for coffee: kahve, which is itself derived from the Arabic: قهوة‎, qahwah."

== How bad are the diterpenes in coffee? ==

Hello,
I noticed that twice in the article (at the top summary and under Health risks) it mentions that one of the main reasons coffee is bad is because of the diterpenes.
I'd never heard of this before so I was interested to know how much the studies can be used. I'm not at all saying that the studies are wrong in anyway.
I'm just interested to know if there's been any official recomendations and if I should be using paper coffee filters to soak the oils up.
In short how bad are they? Could we perhaps add some kind of gauge to the article? (Along the lines of "X recomends the use of paper filters to avoid these" or "futher tests are underway".)

== This is just frustrating... ==

...at this stage. Ethiopian nationalists plugging in Ethiopia into this article for no good reason.

Some things first: the origin of coffee is in Yemen. Our sources agree on that, and our narrative in the article does, too. This article is about the beverage, and reverting additions of Ethiopia to the infobox, however many times, is an exception to 3RR because it falls under reverting vandalism. It is not a content dispute.

Anther editor has reverted my edits with no sources to back them up. I've explained why they are wrong on their talkpage and will copy here as well.

*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=595584674&oldid=595584402 What?] You're reasonable enough to realize this article is about the beverage. There is really no way to defend this but nationalism on your part.
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=595584402&oldid=595584133 This one]. I suspect it's not a benign addition, but rather an attempt to throw in "Ethiopia" in there. Like we discussed last time, it's probably a good idea to get rid of the whole paragraph since the source discusses many, many possible etymologies, and he clearly states this Kaffa one is one the weaker ones (advocated by those with little authority).
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&diff=595584133&oldid=595584002 This one.] I traced it back to a new, disruptive editor. I could be wrong, but the problem with this sentence is that it talks about coffee and not coffea. 

Pending further input from others.

::This is a novel argument that an article about coffee should not mention the origin of coffea because it is thought to be Ethiopia, but not entirely a logical one.  None of the sources about coffee make an artificial separation and eschew talking about one or the other for such specious reasoning, as the topics are clearly intertwined and relevant to one another.  For many years, the infobox stated the origin to be "Ethiopia". {{u|Aua}} today changed that to "Yemen", and to be fair I changed it again to "Ethiopia / Eritrea / Yemen" since the entire region has a claim (and was not always considered distinct throughoutt these periods as it turns out they are closer neighbors than it seems many here realize).  User:Aua then aggressively accused me of being a "nationalist" and "not a benign edit" on my talkpage (while simultaneously asking me to be "reasonable").

== Coffee origin ==

I'll start a new section to focus on one issue: what should the infobox list as the country of origin.
The dispute: our sources and article state that coffee was first brewed in Yemen. The native coffea plant (the main ingredient in coffee) populations could have come from East Africa, and particularly Ethiopia. Since this article is about the beverage, and not the plant, it should only list Yemen as the origin. French fries doesn't list Peru in the countries of origin because potatoes came from South America. Per WP:INFOBOX, the infobox should summarize the subject of the article (in case, coffee and not coffea).
What do other editors think?

:It is true that the first record of brewing coffee comes from Yemen on the north side of the Red Sea.  The Red Sea is a geographic separation more than a cultural one; that is the key fact people tend to overlook. Where it was first brewed is uncertain; where the brewing was first recorded is certain.  For these reasons and not trying to be nationalist or favor any pov I emended it to "Ethiopia / Eritrea / Yemen" since these are the modern countries concerned.

(Edit conflict)
I've been reading this exchange with interest. I don't have any expertise in this area and haven't taken sides. I'd just like to point out a few things. Til, I can see you are getting frustrated, but your arguments become less effective when you veer toward attacking Aua personally. I think the point that there is evidence (it is evidence, isn't it, not just a traditional legend?) that the Oromo mixed roasted coffee beans with butter and fat is helpful, but I think you need to make a better argument that that really was the beginning of the drink "coffee". You might compare this with the fact that the Aztecs drank a brew of cacao beans without sugar. When Europeans got the cacao beans, they created a drink with sugar. Do we say the Aztecs drank hot chocolate? I don't know, but I don't think so, and I think there are very few people today who would drink a brew of ground-up cacao beans without sugar. So I think most people would say that Europeans invented hot chocolate. 

You all sound like intelligent people to me. Til, I think you need to be more specific and less emotional when you rebut Aua. Be precise. Say why you think a particular work (give the title and page, and preferably quote a line) is (a) reliable, and (b) relevant. You are trying to persuade Aua that a work is reliable and relevant when Aua thinks it is not. Then Aua, try to be less dismissive. Rather, respond specifically: say why you think that source is either unreliable or irrelevant. I think if you proceed this way, you will get somewhere.

Christina, citing a source that says coffee was first cultivated in Harar, Ethiopia, does not help much. This article is about the drink called coffee, not the plant that produces the beans. On the other hand, one can ask the question, if not for brewing a drink, for what other reason would a people cultivate a plant that produces beans? Can one suppose that they simply ate the beans, for food, medicine, or religious rituals? What do the experts say?

All of this is certainly within the scope of our article as much as it is in the scope of scholarly research on the history of coffee.

:::::::@Til. Agreed. It's possible they used the beans with fat and butter (although we only have one source on that), but we can mention it (and we kinda already do). The drink itself though appears to be from Yemen (and almost all RS that make the distinction between the plant and the drink say so). Saying otherwise by trying to lump in a few other countries is disingenuous.

::::::::I also agree that what we are seeing is that coffee's drinkable version was developed in Yemen.  But you are arguing for an exceptionally unprecedented and narrow WP:SCOPE for the drinkable version, when this is also ought to cover the history of coffee's uses as a stimulant, as academic works on coffee certainly treat the topic, and we don't even have a better article I know of for covering earlier uses as a stimulant (except [[History of coffee]] where this is equally relevant) I would argue that the brioader SCOPE includes coffee's use as a stimulant, and that sufficient academic, non-nationalist evidence has been presented to establish that the claim of all 3 nations to have had a role in the development of coffee is justified, and mentioning all of them in the infobox is equitable.

::::::::::Fair enough, as now we've narrowed down where our differences lie. It's not a matter of facts, but that of opinion, and I can deal with that. Do you think we should ask for a 3rd opinion on this? I think since coffee as we know it originated in Yemen, with no other verifiable predecessors (except possibly the ones mentioned in 8th century Arabia as well), we should have Yemen there. Chewing on the beans does not really qualify, in my mind, as a plausible origin of the same importance as Yemen. We could, and we should, talk about it though in the article.

::::::(EC) Christina, I read that source, and if you read it carefully, you will see that it does not say where the drink was first consumed. It says cultivation of the plant began in Harar, Ethiopia. If we assume that the drink was first prepared and consumed there, we are just assuming. I'm not saying that Harar couldn't have been the place where coffee was first prepared and consumed. I'm just saying that the source you gave does not clearly say that.[[User:CorinneSD|CorinneSD]] ([[User talk:CorinneSD|talk]]) 23:53, 15 February 2014 (UTC)
::::::::I think the reason why a drink is consumed should not determine whether it belongs in an article about the drink. If coffee was initially drunk for its stimulating effects in connection with religious rituals, it does not mean it cannot be included in the article, and it counts as far as pinpointing the origin of coffee as a drink (beverage). If it can be demonstrated through scholarly research that coffee was first drunk – even if only as a stimulant – in Harar, then Ethiopia needs to be in the info box. But, Til, maybe I've missed it in the long discussion above, but I haven't yet seen (that is, read) a source that says that unequivocally. Can you provide a link for me? I'd like to read it.

::::::::::Corrinne, I concede that I haven't seen much discussion of "drinking" coffee per se in Ethiopia before in Yemen, but clearly they do indicate it was "consumed", so would you agree that per SCOPE this would be the correct article to include its historical consumption as part of the development of modern coffee, and would this justify including Ethiopia and Eritrea in the infobox (where random readers are bound to add it every other week anyway since most people don't make such a fancy separation between "drink" and "non-drink" to give priority to only one of these).

:::::::::::Although you're waiting for Corrinne's reply, I just want to say this: consumption of the plant (itself a contentious issue) is not really the same as making the drink coffee. South Americans consumed potatoes, but it'd be a stretch to include Peru as country of origin in every single plate or drink that uses potatoes as a major ingredient.

Coffee isn't like potato dishes, it is a commodity in itself and is mostly sold in form of a dry roasted bean, not a liquid "drink".

::::::::::::(EC)I read part of that article (the link was provided by Aua, just above). I see that it says that Ethiopians probably did not drink coffee as a beverage "in antiquity", but that they did chew the beans covered in fat. I would go along with including Ethiopia in the info box (with Yemen) because it is part of the history of the development of modern coffee. I assume that would all be explained in detail in the article. Aua, would you go along with it?

:::::::::::::Actually, on that same page, it states that the beverage was invented in Yemen later on. I still find it very hard to include Ethiopia in the infobox (but have absolutely no problem with elaboration of the history in the article), but I'm willing to budge on this position. I'd prefer to have them both removed, or, alternatively, include them both with qualification as follows: "Yemen (earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking), Ethiopia (possible consumption of dry beans)", or the like.

== Economic impacts ==

I just saw the map at the right side of the section "Economic impacts". The caption reads, "Map of coffee areas in Brazil". However, there is no key or legend to indicate which areas are the coffee growing areas. I guess it is the areas shaded darker yellow rather than the areas shaded lighter yellow, but I don't think the reader should have to guess. Also, even if there were a key indicating which areas were the coffee growing areas, the map doesn't really add much to the article. I think it would be more interesting if the names of the provinces where coffee is grown in Brazil were indicated, either on the map or in the caption.

Every once in a while, we get someone here trying to push the mythological origin of Coffee (generally somewhere to Arab colonies in Ethiopia). This issue was settled after a very long and multi-editor debate on this discussion page (see [[Talk:Coffee/Archive_4#Coffee_origin|here]]). At that time, the consensus for origin was: "Yemen (earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking), Ethiopia (possible consumption of dry beans)." Changing it now requires more than a few edits on the page. Please discuss here before going on an edit war.
Cheers,

:No consensus was to include both countries. I have been upholding consensus since this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&type=revision&diff=688205066&oldid=688204895] I have not seen you active. I tried to compromise with you, by removing the origin section completely because "first sighting of a man drinking coffee" is not equivalent to origin. It makes no sense to say it orginated in Yemen, because someone happened to see coffee being drunk. You seem to be censoring material as you have removed my sourced content, therefore i would like an explanation on why you reverted my edits of the history section. Why do you keep repeating the line "earliest credible evidence" in the introduction and body? All sources point to africa its just that the first time coffee entered yemen was through the sufi orders. You did not even reply to my post from november but you are available to revert. If its simple wp:idontlikeit that wont fly. [[User:Zekenyan|Zekenyan]] ([[User talk:Zekenyan|talk]]) 03:59, 11 January 2016 (UTC)
::There are two points here, and I hope you'd respond to each separately:
:::*Please look at the link above (see [[Talk:Coffee/Archive_4#Coffee_origin|here]]). I will draw your attention [[Talk:Coffee/Archive_4#Coffee_origin|here]] specifically. Scroll down and see the consensus we actually came up with. It took a lot of back and forth, but it was the compromise we agreed upon. I am not happy with it because there is no historical evidence for Africa at all, but I grudgingly went along. Now, find me where, exactly, are you drawing your "consensus" version from? Who agreed to it and when? What was the phrasing exactly?
:::*There is no historical evidence for it being made in Africa. At all. Yes, some will speculate about its origin there, but there really is nothing to support that beyond a few Ethiopia myths. Please don't copy-paste "author X says it was likely in Africa," because that doesn't really prove much. We can't go with speculation here. This is why I am not pushing for "Coffee was invented in Yemen," but rather a more neutral and descriptive position. 
::What is my personal opinion? That's irrelevant. I personally think the paucity of inventions on the African continent as well as the historical evidence is much, much in favor of Yemen. There is as much room for Ethiopia here as flat earth in the earth article. That said, that's OR, and it has no place here. I try to be as objective here and include the facts. Basically, what I'm saying is that my compromise position is really that: a compromise. If I wanted to bulldoze my opinion through, I would be a lot more hardline. I'm trying to be as neutral and facts-based as possible.

See previous discussion above about consensus to include both countries. Even the other user was upholding consensus [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&type=revision&diff=682915430&oldid=682913530] Changing consensus without my agreement just because I added information in the history section is not acceptable. All your doing is censoring reliably sourced material that points to Ethiopia. Dont falsely accuse me of OR and copy paste, I clearly sourced my addition. You are coming up with your own conclusions that the source did not explicitly say sort of like [[wp:snyth]]! heard of it? For example deleting testimonies by [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]] is another red flag. Yes you are pushing for Coffee being invented in Yemen under the pretexts of "earliest historical evidence". Adding "earliest credible source of coffee drinking" in the infobox is a serious violation. It only misleads the reader to think Coffee was invented in Yemen. There are countless testomonies of Arab historians mentioning the origin of Coffee to be in Ethiopia before it arrived in Yemen. Sources

===Third Opinion===
A [[WP:3O|third opinion]] has been requested.  Is the question limited to the infobox?  If so, and reliable sources say Yemen, the infobox should say Yemen, and leave the details in the article body.  But is that what reliable sources say?  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] ([[User talk:Robert McClenon|talk]]) 01:59, 23 January 2016 (UTC)
:The reliable sources doesnt just say Yemen. It says Ethiopia and Yemen, although I do agree with your proposal, infact I said the same thing in the discussion above . This isnt just about the infobox. I added a historical analysis and it was removed. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&type=revision&diff=699237915&oldid=699217824] The user said my addition to the historical section is OR so I would like your opinion on the matter. [[User:Zekenyan|Zekenyan]] ([[User talk:Zekenyan|talk]]) 03:06, 23 January 2016 (UTC)
::Thank you for volunteering a third opinion. The issue at hand is the infobox, for which a series of reverts occurred recently.
::So we are debating what should the infobox list while a new consensus is reached. I support the phrasing "Country of origin: Yemen (earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking), Ethiopia (possible consumption of dry beans," while Zekenyan supports "Country of origin: Ethiopia and Yemen."
::The question is twofold really: what was the most recent consensus and what do the sources say. The old consensus was reached [[Talk:Coffee/Archive_4#Coffee_origin|here]]. To spare you time reading a very long thread, it was agreed, after a discussion of both sides and supporting evidence for each, that both countries should be listed, but with qualification. 

::For the second part of the question: the issue is unfortunately not black and white. The origin of coffee is obscure, although the first historical evidence we have is from Yemen. There is really nothing that supports Ethiopia except a few Ethiopian myths and speculation from some experts (whom Zekenyan will selectively reference, including the source above). This is why I suggested the old format which everyone agreed in our most recent linked consensus to demonstrate the most neutral and evidence-supported phrasing for country of origin: 
::"Country of origin: Yemen (earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking), Ethiopia (possible consumption of dry beans"
::Zekenyan was reverted as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coffee&type=revision&diff=699355421&oldid=699241944 recently as Jan 11] by other editors for trying to remove that qualification.

:::So let me get this straight. You DONT want Yemen in the box by itself like ME and THIRD OPINION suggested? Your clogging the infobox with unnecessary information as well as repeating the statement "earliest credible evidence" in multiple parts of this article, the intro and history. My issue is that your omitting credible tradition that Sufis encountered Coffee in Ethiopia. Historical connections like Abd al-qadir al Jaziri, after speaking of the introduction of coffee to the Yemen, cautions the reader ''"We say that this account pertains to the Yemen alone not anywhere else because the appearance of coffee was in the land Ibn Sa'ad al-Din and the country of the Abyssinians and of the Jabart, and other places of the land of the Ajam, but the time of its first use is unknown, nor do we know the reason"''-Coffee and coffeehouses-p.13 [https://books.google.ca/books?id=MeXkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=arab+or+western+inspiration+coffee&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=arab%20or%20western%20inspiration%20coffee&f=false] Omitting historical facts like this from the article is POV.

:*Second source: it appears to be better identified. The source, La Roque, while not ideal, is pretty sufficient for our purposes.

::Here are my concerns: The next few lines makes reference of early religious ceremonies pertaining to early use of coffee both in the yemen and horn of africa. This is why for neutrality purposes, the most common academic connection to coffee in ethiopia is the farmer argument so it should be mentioned.  The first source discusses harvesting and the second discusses cultivation so either one can be used. Here is another source on cultivation [https://books.google.ca/books?id=ssNMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA462&dq=oxford+encyclopedia+coffee+cultivation&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=oxford%20encyclopedia%20coffee%20cultivation&f=false] I think academics have agreed that farming originates in ethiopia most likely because of the fact that the plant is indigenous [https://books.google.ca/books?id=Y4N54Wn618YC&pg=PA697&dq=coffee+plant+is+indigenous&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=coffee%20plant%20is%20indigenous&f=false] In the 2005 book [[Coffee: A Dark History]] the author believes that Coffee use was first discovered by Ethiopian farmers. [[User:Zekenyan|Zekenyan]] ([[User talk:Zekenyan|talk]]) 01:05, 26 January 2016 (UTC)
:::I completely agree with your concerns: I always found that whole religious ceremonies chunk a bit misplaced. It really doesn't fit into the flow. I would suggest having that removed and maybe having that section in the intro read something like: 
:::"Coffee's exact origin is obscure, but the plant is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Yemen. Coffee was first cultivated in that region and spread to other parts of the world through European and Arab travellers. The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in the Sufi Muslim monasteries around Mocha in Yemen."
:::Or the like. To be fair, no one will ever know where it is cultivated first. It could be the Arab colonies in Abyssinia like your source says or it could be in Yemen. Saying "that region" seems to be the most factual thing since we are at least sure it's somewhere there, although no one will ever know which country.

This also goes in line with britannica's analysis that the plant orginated in africa.

:::::::::::But coffee was taken to Yemen from Ethiopia for a reason, and it is perfectly valid to assume this was because of the plants energising effect. The story of Kaldi also did not appear in writing until the 1670's. From research, this is an Oromo name and the language itself at the time this legend was said to be happening in was only a spoken language, not a written one. You did discuss in the previous parts of this page where Ethiopia should be allocated on the article, and I do honestly think it should be in the fact-box. Thank you.[[User:Resourcer1|Resourcer1]] ([[User talk:Resourcer1|talk]]) 23:30, 26 January 2016 (UTC)

:::::::::::::So is there consensus to include my proposal bit in the article? as far as Resourcer --keywords "15th century Introduction to the world" That is why I believe Yemen should be in the box by itself. I understand that Coffee's historical connection to Ethiopia has been ignored in this article in favour of "myths". I hope to fix these issues by referencing actual historical accounts. I think we can all agree at least that Coffee became popular through Yemen. [[User:Zekenyan|Zekenyan]] ([[User talk:Zekenyan|talk]]) 01:03, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

I am proposing to add this into the historical transmission section. I would like editors opinion on the matter.

Earliest mention of coffee in Yemen was by Ahmed al-Ghaffar in the 15th century. It was used by sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=rxMz-Ro6CjQC&pg=PA346&lpg=PA346&dq=coffee+ahmad+al+ghaffar&source=bl&ots=SwBIsiVTVO&sig=jqeEq1cInZ07EWs_y2ocLKGTjF0&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=coffee%20ahmad%20al%20ghaffar&f=false] Muhammad b. Said other wise known as Dhabhani is credited for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=MeXkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=coffee+and+coffeehouses+much+of+his+material&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=coffee%20and%20coffeehouses%20much%20of%20his%20material&f=false] Other early accounts ascribe Ali b. Omar of the Shadhili sufi order for the introduction of coffee to Arabia. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=5POdm7UKXP4C&pg=PA78&dq=ali+omar+coffee+yemen&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ali%20omar%20coffee%20yemen&f=false] According to al Shardi, Ali b.Omar may have encountered coffee when he lived with the Adal Sultan Sadadin’s companions in 1401. Famous 16th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings of a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region.

:::My concerns with this paragraph:
:::*Fragmented: jumps from one account to another abruptly,
:::*Needs improvement on formatting: both grammar and spelling,
:::*Not quite supported by the sources. Take [https://books.google.ca/books?id=MeXkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=coffee+and+coffeehouses+much+of+his+material&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=coffee%20and%20coffeehouses%20much%20of%20his%20material&f=false this] for instance. While the sentence it supports is stated as a fact, the source not only diverges from it, it casts doubt on its reliability. The rest of the book after that quote paragraph goes on to doubt how accurate that account is.
:::Writing the whole history with all the accounts we have without being selective is going to be tough, especially because whatever we do, we will just be spouting off someone else's speculation on where it came from, don't you agree?
:::I'd be curious what other editors think.

::::Ahmed al-Ghaffars account is the source of "earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking" attributed to sufis in Yemen. That is why it is regarded as the most reliable source by weinberg.[https://books.google.ca/books?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&pg=PA10&dq=slippery+slope+weinberg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHvtqpjM7KAhUovIMKHYBwDYcQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=slippery%20slope%20weinberg&f=false] Omar's account is the less reliable account. We dont have alot of accounts there's only 3 at most therefore I dont see a "selective issue"  If you read the whole section on Coffee in the Brill source [https://books.google.ca/books?id=7CP7fYghBFQC&pg=PA635&dq=coffee+history+brill&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=coffee%20history%20brill&f=false] The accounts give credit to introduction of Coffee from Africa, this is the basis of the fictional kaldi story. Weinberg makes note of this here [https://books.google.ca/books?id=AGaTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=weinberg+credible+tradition&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPleyBm87KAhVLmR4KHcYCBPMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=weinberg%20credible%20tradition&f=false]. We cant simply accept Ghaffar's account without telling the whole story. @[[User:Aua|Aua]] Your recent edit makes the whole historical transmission section redundant therefore my proposal on including accounts should be replaced with it. Nobody wants to read the same thing twice. [[User:Zekenyan|Zekenyan]] ([[User talk:Zekenyan|talk]]) 11:20, 30 January 2016 (UTC)
::::::@Zekenyan, I agree with you completely that we should include those accounts. I apologize for the delay in replying; real life has been keeping me busy.

:::::::No problem. The roasted and brewed line is repeated twice perhaps a different wording? @[[User:Resourcer1]] simply reverting edits will not help if you wont discuss them. What exactly is your argument? The plant is not the same as the beverage. [[User:Zekenyan|Zekenyan]] ([[User talk:Zekenyan|talk]]) 13:27, 7 February 2016 (UTC)

::::::::::The plant and drink is native to Ethiopia. Once agian the plant is native to Ethiopia, not Yemen! Just becuase Yemenis brought it to Yemen from Ethopia and started exporting it and trading with it does not mean they are the originators. Coffee orginated in Ethiopia, both bean and drink many of the sources point to that. The Ethiopians did know the effects of drinking coffee, long before the Yemenis did. Why eaven mention Yemen as orginators??? , they should be mentioned as the ones who  exported  it?? Are you trying to rewrite history?

== Berry vs. Drupe ==

Recently, changes were accepted to the Coffea page to reflect the fact that while Coffee is arguably an epigynous berry, the proper taxonomic classification is drupe.  Please see pg. 466 of "An annotated taxonomic conspectus of the genus Coffea (Rubiaceae)" referring to coffee as a "indehiscent drupe." This page should reflect the same.  While the current term "berries" does have a link to epigynous berries, neglecting to use the proper taxonomy only adds confusion to the already-muddled distinctions between botanical berries, epigynous berries, and drupes.  Furthermore, coffee fruits are referred to as "cherries" in the industry, so even if the intention is common or colloquial usage, it should still be changed (see the Coffea page referring to coffee fruit as "cherries").  For maximum educational value, an editor should change all references to berries to drupes.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/168.93.82.35|168.93.82.35]] ([[User talk:168.93.82.35|talk]]) 21:21, 10 February 2016 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I think that this page is a little bit long, so can we split this page up into separate pages, with the respective topic? [[User:Kai2004|Kai2004]] ([[User talk:Kai2004|talk]]) 17:50, 2 March 2016 (UTC)
