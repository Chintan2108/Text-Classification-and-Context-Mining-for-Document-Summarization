== Orphaned references in [[:Astronomy]] ==

I check pages listed in [[:Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting]] to try to fix reference errors. One of the things I do is look for content for [[User:AnomieBOT/docs/OrphanReferenceFixer|orphaned references]] in wikilinked articles. I have found content for some of [[:Astronomy]]'s orphans, the problem is that I found more than one version. I can't determine which (if any) is correct for ''this'' article, so I am asking for a sentient editor to look it over and copy the correct ref content into this article.

<b>Reference named "Kennedy-1962":</b><ul>
<li>From [[Observatory]]: {{citation |last=Kennedy |first=Edward S. |year=1962 |title=Review: ''The Observatory in Islam and Its Place in the General History of the Observatory'' by Aydin Sayili |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–239 |doi=10.1086/349558 }}</li>
<li>From [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]]: {{Harv|Kennedy|1962}}</li>

== Factual Concerns ==
The phrase 'well-accepted' is odd for a scientific page. It occurs with respect to Big Bang. The implication is that there is no actual evidence, just the 'acceptance'.
Also the dark matter further down, which is mentioned as if it were real, when it is merely a logical instrument that allows the big bang maths to look better.
Perhaps these two topics belong to the pseudo-science page?

==Misuse of sources==
A [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Jagged_85|request for comments]] has been filed concerning the conduct of {{User|Jagged 85}}. Jagged 85 is one of the main contributors to Wikipedia (over 67,000 edits, he's ranked [[Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits|198 in the number of edits]]), and practically all of his edits have to do with Islamic science, technology and philosophy. This editor has persistently [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jagged 85/Evidence|misused sources here over several years]]. This editor's contributions are always well provided with citations, but examination of these sources often reveals either a blatant misrepresentation of those sources or a selective interpretation, going beyond any reasonable interpretation of the authors' intent.

==Merge==
It has been suggested that [[Optical astronomy]] be merged with the main page.  I didn't see anything before on this page about it, but if there was then I missed it.  Regardless, optical astronomy should not be merged, because it is a method of astronomy just like all the others, and it would be more beneficial to expand it than merge it.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.252.81.84|70.252.81.84]] ([[User talk:70.252.81.84|talk]]) 16:25, 18 August 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I want to add links from the sightings section of the [[International Space Station]] article to the astronomy article.

There are [[Naked Eye]] sightings, there are sightings using equipment such as binoculars and telescopes, there is astrophotography, which is photographing the ISS through telescopes.

Which of these are considered astronomy, which are not? there are no references on the page to satellites in relation to people who are interested in looking at them, are satellites and the space station considered to be celestial objects ?

== The size of the earth - really Aristarchus? ==

Despite the alleged citation in the article, from what I can find on the internet [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] did not calculate the size of the earth, he just used it as a relative measure. Like it says in [[On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)]], "This work calculates the sizes of the Sun and Moon, as well as their distances from the Earth in terms of Earth's radius." If he actually had calcuated the size of the earth as well, he could have made absolute estimates of the distances. 

[[Eratosthenes]] is also famous for calculating the size of the earth at around the same time [[User:Siuenti|Siuenti]] ([[User talk:Siuenti|talk]]) 15:20, 25 July 2013 (UTC)

== List of practical inventions from astronomy/space travel? ==

I was wondering, is there somewhere on Wikipedia, or would it be useful/interesting to create, a list or an article listing specific technology that was invented, or applied for the first time, in astronomy/space travel? For such technology, it would of course be necessary to find reliable sources for the fact that they indeed came from astronomy. Here's a small list of what I have in mind, for which I have varrying degrees of certainty that they indeed came from astronomy or were first applied there, but just to give you an idea what you mean:
* Teflon, although not invented by NASA, was first applied on a large scale in space travel
* The invention of the barcode was predated, and supposedly inspired, by the unique 'barcode' optical spectrums for stars and other objects, created in the optical spectroscopy in astronomy.
* Glass fibers were used in astronomy for they were used on a large scale for data communication in the every day world.
* The technology to bring vehicles out of the atmosphere and into an earth orbit, was later used to build the system of sattelites for telecommunications and GPS systems.
* And from various sources a list of unverified items that might or might not qualify:
** Memory foam
** Anti-corrosion coating
** Cochlear implants (hearing aid)
** Insulin pump
** Life shears (the fire fighter tool)
** Water filters
There are probably more examples.
I'd like to hear your thoughts; or maybe such an article/list/category already exist and I just haven't been able to find it yet. -- [[User:RagingR2|RagingR2]] ([[User talk:RagingR2|talk]]) 22:50, 5 November 2013 (UTC)

== Doubtful text ==

''Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars had to be conducted from the only vantage points available, namely tall buildings and high ground using the naked eye.''

This implies that high ground was more important as a vantage point before the invention of the telescope than after it. It is unclear why this should be so. It is not clear either why observation from tall buildings would have been advantageous, except in the special case of viewing objects near the horizon.

== Reading level of into para is too high ==

I used this utility, https://www.online-utility.org/english/readability_test_and_improve.jsp  , to parse the intro paragraph for readablity and found this: 

*Number of characters (without spaces) :	406.00
*Number of words :	72.00
*Number of sentences :	2.00
*Average number of characters per word :	5.64
*Average number of syllables per word :	1.93
*Average number of words per sentence:	36.00
*Indication of the number of years of formal education that a person requires in order to easily understand the *text on the first reading
*Gunning Fog index :	24.40
*Approximate representation of the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend the text :	 
*Coleman Liau index :	16.58
*Flesch Kincaid Grade level :	21.23	
*ARI (Automated Readability Index) :	23.13	
*SMOG :	21.57	
*Flesch Reading Ease :	6.97  (the higher the better)

While it is nice to have completeness, it is far better to make the first paragraph simple. I suggest a rewrite as follows: 

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena. The objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally all astronomical phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth is the perview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.

The results for this are:

*Number of characters (without spaces) :	495.00
*Number of words :	88.00
*Number of sentences :	5.00
*Average number of characters per word :	5.62
*Average number of syllables per word :	1.98
*Average number of words per sentence:	17.60
*Indication of the number of years of formal education that a person requires in order to easily understand the *text on the first reading
*Gunning Fog index :	17.49
*Approximate representation of the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend the text :	 
*Coleman Liau index :	15.63
*Flesch Kincaid Grade level :	14.61

'''Not sure''' about the proposed paragraph. In particular, it mentions up-front the applying of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. If we are going to mention those allied subjects in the first paragraph (and some of that was also an issue in the older version), then we probably need to have balance with some mention of observational methods as well. Note that physics and maths are also discussed in the third paragraph of the lead where the dichotomy of theoretical and observational astronomy is made. So, I suppose I'm not in favor of the proposed paragraph as is, though the version that was there (before you recent edit) could certainly be improved by . Thanks.

:You failed to address the issue of readablity. Not sure what you were trying to say about the application of mathematics, physics and chemistry and the "balance" with observational methods. Virtually everything mentioned in the original para is in the second but without the parenthetical insertions and overly long sentences. The object of this edit was to do as you proposed: cutting a long sentences up a bit.

==Some thoughts==
Hi I'm new to wikipedia, and I plan to work on astronomy articles =)  Sorry in advance for horrible wikitext format...  I'll fix it soon.  Here's a quick quote and its reference:
* "Astronomy is defined as the study of the objects that lie beyond our planet Earth and the processes by which these objects interact with one another."<ref>OpenStax, Astronomy. OpenStax. 13 October 2016. [<http://cnx.org/content/col11992/latest/>]  (chapter 1.1 The Nature of Astronomy, page 13).</ref> <br />
* I think it would be important to mention that it is a observational science, versus an experimental science (like chemistry), since astronomy is often based upon observing the history of the universe in the same way a geologist would of the Earth. [[Observation]] article also looks like it needs some help

:Hi [[User:Popcrate|Popcrate]] and welcome to Wikipedia!  Thank you for your interest, especially in astronomy articles!  You might want to consider that 1) astronomy is the study of objects ''and'' phenomena that lie beyond planet Earth, and 2) while astromomy is observational-only in a "classic" sense, other hands-on experimental/empirical sciences fall within the heading of "astronomy", such as those related to [[space exploration]], the design and manufacture of [[telescope]]s and their components, and so on.

There seem to be sources that take me to an organization's website, but not necessarily any information pertaining to the main topic of the page itself.

It would also be beneficial, I think, to include as much of the earliest instruments that were used in astronomy by early astronomers like Copernicus, Aristotle, etc. 

Overall, the article is relatively neutral and does explain the basic idea of astronomy.  [[Special:Contributions/107.77.199.213|107.77.199.213]] ([[User talk:107.77.199.213|talk]]) 15:08, 31 October 2018 (UTC)

== Stagnant in medieval Europe? Not really ==

The article, as it is, offers absolutely zero space to any of the astronomical progress in medieval Europe on the basis that it was "stagnant", in other words, implying there was none. But this is an old view and modern historians are certainly aware of progress in astronomy in Europe during the Middle Ages, if not major. The page fails to name a number of medieval European astronomers who made contributions to the study of astronomy, including [[William of Hirsau]], [[Georg von Peuerbach]], or even [[Richard of Wallingford]] who, among many things, invented the first astronomical clock.[[Special:Contributions/64.231.43.14|64.231.43.14]] ([[User talk:64.231.43.14|talk]]) 23:08, 2 December 2018 (UTC)
:The statement that you removed: "During the Middle Ages, astronomy was mostly stagnant in medieval Europe, at least until the 13th century" does really contradict what you added - all these astronomers lived in the 13-th century or later.

===General===

:Most (if not all) astronomers now have a strong background in physics, and observations are always put in an astrophysical context, so the distinction between astronomy and astrophysics almost doesn't exist anymore. 
Is this true for planetary scientists and exobiologists, though?  For an astrophysicist I imagine there's no significant difference, but what about the other specializations within astronomy? --[[User:LMS|LMS]]

*I imagine a background in chemistry might also be uselful--[[User:Hello fromSPACE|'''<font color=blue>Hello</font>''']]<small>''''from'''</small><sup>''''<small>SPACE</small>'''</sup><font color=green><sup><span style="background-color: blue"></span></sup></font> 00:10, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

I've been thinking about that. The truth is, I didn't think of
exobiologist as astronomers...but according to my own definition,
they are. Maybe I should think of moving this back to astronomy,
and giving exobiology a place there. In the case of planetary scientists, i'm pretty sure that their physics background must be
good, though they could be strongers in other areas of [[:earth science|earth science]]s. I think we need more astronomers around here. -- [[User:AN|AN]]

In some countries other than the US, astronomers and astrophysicists are distinctly separate categories.  I'm a [[grad student]] in astronomy and my [[Yugoslavia]]n classmates assure me these are very separate there, that astronomers only measure things and only get a Master's degree while astronomers do only theory and get a PhD.  Should this be elaborated on the page for NPOV reasons?  -- [[User:Zandperl|zandperl]] 04:40, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Has anyone considered pilfering NASA site for materials to add?  I've just gone there and not found a general copyright notice, stating that it covers materials on the entire site, but it seems to be under the typical U.S. gov't terms; the notices I have found all say not to use pictures including recognizable people for any commercial purpose w/o written permission, and say the materials must not be used to imply endorsement by NASA, etc.  No explicit word on whether the materials are in the public domain (I expect that they are).  --KQ

Actually, just on mon I emailed the webmaster of image.gspc.nasa.gov about their 
copyrights, because of the article [[:x-ray astronomy|x-ray astronomy]] that I found out was
copied from there. The head e-mailed me back telling aprox "we are a federal gov.
site so our material is in the public domain, we appreciate, though, that credit
is given"...so, i put the article back, with a link to the website saying it was
from them. That opens lots of new oportunities. [[User:AN|AN]]

I recently researched this for a presentation I was giving, and got the following info/pages.  NASA images are not quite public domain, but are free for use with only a credit to NASA.  Check out [http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/] for their image server, and [http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/copyright.html] for the copyright info.  -- [[User:Zandperl|zandperl]] 04:40, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)

I really hate what they did to this page. From a page that actually contained some information, it became a list of links. Don't anybody thinks the same!

:I agree. The recent changes suck. AstroNomer, you know this page better than me. Would you like to revert? -- [[User:CYD|CYD]]

::I tend to agree also - I think it had a lot of useful info before which has now disappeared. Judging from Lir's comments at the bottom of [[Talk:Main Page]], she thinks this is a great improvement. I can see what she's getting at: there is, I think, some value in a plain list of links on a particular complex subject - an index page, if you like - but I'd rather it was on a separate page, like [[List of astronomy topics]] or something. --[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

Has this information actually disappeared? My understanding is that it is all enclosed behind the appropriate links. Now if you want...we could have an explanation of positional astronomy and an explanation of radio telescopes etc. etc. but that isn't going to be very useful to the reader. If the reader wants to read that explanation, they want to go to the full page, not get a brief synposis of it. 

Not that no information should be presented here, Id like to see more information here, but a discussion of what is already on another page is pointless.  [[User:Lir|Lir]] 16:17 Nov 3, 2002 (UTC)

:I'm not sure it would be ''entirely'' pointless to have some duplication here. I agree that the page shouldn't go into too much depth, but I think a brief overview of all the main areas (and some of the minor areas also) is useful, with a more in depth treatment on the individual pages. I also think that in some cases, it is useful to have a brief note next to links; it probably isn't obvious to an average reader what [[precession]] is, for instance, and a note would give them the briefest possible explanation of it, so they know whether they want to read more. People who know what it means are probably going to use the search function anyway. That said, this isn't a subject I know much about, so I'll let those who know more get on with it.--[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

I don't know if a brief cliff's note describing precession would be of any use to the reader either. The physics page doesn't have that sort of format. Ie

[[User:Lir|Lir]] 16:55 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)

I agree. The page is now ''merely'' a laundry list of links to other pages, whereas before it was actually a readable '''article'''! Imagine you know nothing about astronomy. Reading through the article, you see a bunch of links with incomprehensible names. Why should you click on any of them? Which should you click on? It's unusable.

It IS still a '''readable article'''. There are several paragraphs at the top. Imagine you know nothing about astronomy...where to start? I advise you make [[Astronomy for Beginners]]. This page did not serve the function you suggest before it was edited to this format. Such a page would probably refer the reader to [[Amateur Astronomy]] and [[positional astronomy]].

There's nothing wrong with duplicating information. Ideally, we want a short discussion of each important topic in the astronomy article, with the topic examined in greater depth in the full page. See, for example, the [[Physics]] article, which contains a short history of physics with a more detailed history in the works in a separate page. It isn't perfect, but I think it's more motivating than a laundry list.

Lir, could you please put the removed information back on this page? -- [[User:CYD|CYD]]

The only difference I can see between this and the physics page is that we have moved the [[history of astronomy]] to it's own page. You say you want a brief discussion of each "important topic" but what is important? What good will it do to cut and paste the first paragraph from each subject page onto this page? [[User:Lir|Lir]] 16:50 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)

: well, maybe not the first paragraph, but bare lists are not terribly good content. -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]]

i restored some but it looks '''way''' messy to me. The list without comment is much more useful. [[User:Lir|Lir]] 17:19 Nov 4, 2002 (UTC)

------

I have changed the article to a form that is closer to its
former self. In particular
*I put back the explanation of the different subfields of study
*I eliminated the list of isolated topics, after verifying they are listed in "list of astronomy topics".
*I put back the short history. It is my belief that a short story of the subject is adequate in this page, and a long history deserves its own article. I consider this to be subject to discussion.--[[User:AstroNomer|AN]] 01:58 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)

Your revert erased subfields. [[User:Lir|Lir]] 15:40 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)

Your brief history was pointless. It's all in [[history of astronomy]] and it is meaningless to those who know nothing and redundant to those who do know the history. I believe the only question here is whether there should be a paragraph explaining the difference between [[radio astronomy]] and [[X-Ray astronomy]] and [[optical astronomy]]. I see no reason for such madness. If somebody wants to read about [[optical astronomy]] they can click on the link. That's what it is there for.

I mean

Infrared astronomy deals with using infrared radiation 

is about as pointless as

Radio astronomy deals with using radio telescopes

Once again the revert is losing a lot of data by going back so far and since it doesnt add anything that isnt on another page... rerevert [[User:Lir|Lir]] 22:00 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)

It was you modifications that lost a lot of information. And the previous edit back was not a simple revert, but I tried to incorporate several of the changes you had made.
You, instead, simply put back your last copy, that doesn't read like an article, and misses information.--[[User:AstroNomer|AN]]

Now look. As the page says, Astronomy is a big topic. Thus, Astronomy needs some disambiguation. Go look at a disambiguation page-see how they have a big list that is clearly visible? You have all this history of astronomy stuff clogging the top of the page-there is a page for '''history of astronomy''' its all there. [[User:Lir|Lir]] 22:49 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)

:No one is disputing that all of astronomy cannot fit onto one page, but it does not follow that the astronomy article should be little more than a list of topics. People click on a link to "astronomy" expecting to see a cohesive and articulate article on astronomy, so there is nothing wrong with having a brief history of astronomy on this page - just as there is nothing wrong with having a list of links of further topics co-existing with it. -- [[User:CYD|CYD]]

I am not disputing that information should not be on this page, I am only disputing the type and location of it. To be honest, I really don't care what you put below the links-but those links need to be high up on the page so they are easily used by someone. [[User:Lir|Lir]] 23:51 Nov 6, 2002 (UTC)

In drafting the original section differentiating astronomy and astrology, I deliberately avoided calling astrology a '''pseudoscience''' in an attempt to maintain the NPOV.  Calling it a pseudoscience (although of course I believe it is, at best) is kind of a slap in the face, and that's not neutral.  What's the consensus?  Should this be reworded?  If we call it a pseudoscience here, what's to keep someone from using loaded language on the astrology page to denigrate astronomy?

That said, I'll be content to abide with whatever the consensus on this is. Tally ho! [[User:Stormwriter|Stormwriter]]

Do astrologists claim that its a science? Yes, I guess they do...

The study of the positions and aspects of celestial bodies in the belief that they have an influence on the course of natural earthly occurrences and human affairs. 

I would word it that astrologers argue that they are conducting science BUT the key tenent of the scientific process is that a scientific hypothesis leads to predictions which can be proven as correct. This argument is ignored on most "astrology IS a science" websites. So the question then is, "Do any astrologers have any predictions that we can test for validity?" and wait to see if anyone offers up a prediction. 
[[User:Lir|Lir]] 04:41 Nov 7, 2002 (UTC)

:Sure Astrologers have made and do make testable predictions, and they often then attempt to test them, they've tried biographical studies etc.  Heck some astrological predictions are verifiable and intertranslatable with predictions in other fields, Farmer's almanacs often phrase predictions about harvest times in astrological terms for instance.  And the whole notion of ''the key tenet of the scientific process'' is a thornier issue mired in POV, see [[scientific method]] [[User:Bmorton3|Bmorton3]] 21:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC)


You could word it "mainstream/academic scientists call astrology a science."  I would also take care to mention in the history section that astronomy and astrology were once the same field of study.  -- [[User:Zandperl|zandperl]] 02:28, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)

==Definition of "Astronomy" using etymology==


It would be best not to give the etymological derivation of "astronomy" because etymology is often unhelpful. "Meteorology" for instance means literally "the study of meteors". This is because the ancient Greeks thought meteors were portents of storms etc, and so could be used to predict weather. "Meteorology" today just means the study of all aspects of weather. Similarly "astronomy" does not refer to the study of stars, but of all objects and phenomena to be seen (or even NOT seen!) in the heavens. So I'd omit the etymology and go straight to a modern definition of "astronomy".

==telescopes==

Would anyone be interested helping with a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Telescopes]] and/or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Space Telescopes]]?  Should a telescopes template include space telescopes?  It/they could be modeled after the following articles:

* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomical Objects]]
* [[Hubble Space Telescope]]

==Astronmy v. Astrology==

<strike>Rmhermen</strike>ChrisO, let me start by saying I think you did some good work on the astronomy page trying to observe NPOV while inserting relevant detail. But can we please remove the word "scientists"? '''I feel''' astrology is considered by everyone as a pseudoscience (reference to their lack of scientific method pretty much seals the case). One thing to keep in mind is this is about astronomy, not a rebuttal of astrology, honestly I think pointing out that contemporary astrologers (do we really know about the ancient past?) do not follow the scientific method is enough, saying this makes it a pseudoscience is redundant and hinting that this belief is shared by elitist "scientists" while the rest of us fall for that bunk is kind of insulting to me (and might be to other casual readers). - [[User:Plautus satire|Plautus satire]] 16:37, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:I've sort of 'adopted' astrology under the major heading of [[Culture]] called '''[[Alchemy]], [[Astrology]] and [[Obsolete_scientific_theory|Pre-science]]'''  which ties things like the [[Zodiac]], [[Protoscience]], [[pseudoscience]] and other not-so-scientific stuff to [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Culture|Culture]] rather than [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Science|Science]]. ````

: I feel there is plenty of evidence that astrologers in the past did attempt to follow the scientific method as it was understood then, further some astrologers in the present do attempt to follow the scientific method as they understand it.  For every "astrologers don't follow the scientific method" cite you can come up with I can come up with an astrologer claiming to follow the scientific method, and a philosopher arguing about exactly what the scientific method is.  The [[astrology]] page has a reference for an astrologer claiming to follow the scientific method.  I suspect there is a near consensus among astronomers that astrology does not follow the scientific method, but that doesn't make it NPOV. [[User:Bmorton3|Bmorton3]] 21:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
::Totally agree. As someone a lot more interested in astronomy than astrology, I think it is important to remember that, though astrology may, in today's Occident, have been turned into a big joke or make-money-quick scheme, it was traditionally considered a serious attempt at science (regardless of its accuracy or lack thereof).

==Don't think this is true==


:: During part of the 20th century astronomy was considered to be separated into [[astrometry]], [[celestial mechanics]] and [[astrophysics]]. The current high status of astrophysics can be seen reflected in the naming of University departments and institutions involved in astronomical research: the oldest ones are invariably ''Astronomy'' departments and institutes, the newest ones tend to include astrophysics in their names, sometimes excluding the word astronomy, to emphasize the nature of its research. Furthermore, astrophysical research, especially in [[theoretical astrophysics]] can be carried out by people whose background is in physics or mathematics rather than astronomy.

:I believe it is true.  At least the part about the traditional three branches being enumerated as astrometry, celestial mechanics and astrophysics, and how astrophysics has more or less come to be synonymous with astronomy in the last few decades.  Is it the wording you want to change?  [[User:Curps|Curps]] 22:50, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:From my experience, the content of that paragraph is true.  In the Western world today, astronomy and astrophysics are mostly synonymous, and students are encouraged to learn theory (astrophysics) as well as observation techniques (astrometry).  Within the modern astronomy/astrophysics community, I have definitely observed a rivalry between those specializing in theory and observation.  However, in less industrialized countries they are sometimes different departments, or different concentrations within one department, with the highest astronomy degree being a [[Master's]] (or equivalent), and the highest in astrophyiscs being [[PhD]].  Wording-wise, I think I might say that it was two branches, astrometry==celestial mechanics, and astrophysics.  --[[User:Zandperl|zandperl]] 23:02, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

No, astrometry and celestial mechanics are different.  Astrometry was about accurately mapping the positions of the "fixed" stars and recording the motions of the planets.  It was most of what early astronomers did, including the ancient Greeks, long before Kepler and Newton.  It still lives on with the [[Hipparcos]] satellite.  Celestial mechanics is about calculating orbital elements for planets and such and predicting their future positions, calculating perturbations, etc.

I have seen this traditional division of astronomy into astrometry, celestial mechanics and astrophysics mentioned before in other sources.  Today, of course, it has much less significance since photography and CCDs have automated the mapping of positions and computers have automated calculating orbits, and much of the science of astronomy is astrophysics.  [[User:Curps|Curps]] 01:13, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I do think having a discussion of this breakdown is useful, but I disagree with its placement as paragraphs 2 and 3 in the introduction section.  I think it should be placed further down, in the "divisions of astronomy" section.  --[[User:Zandperl|zandperl]] 02:47, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Astrology==
A preëmptive note here, which I&nbsp;hope will head off a lot of pointless squabbling. Astrology properly wouldn't belong on this page at all, were it not for the facts that (a)&nbsp;astronomy and astrology share some common history; (b)&nbsp;a lot of people do confuse astrology with astronomy. It would be sufficient, I&nbsp;think, merely to mark, as has been done, the shared history and that they should not be confused, sending people who land here by accident off to the article they're looking for: no need to give astrology undue prominence. Therefore I've toned down the POV attack on astrology, which doesn't belong here at all: it's enough to state, as has been done quite properly, that the two disciplines differ in method, and to link astronomy to [[scientific method]]; links to [[pseudoscience]] are just inflammatory. People interested in astronomy by and large couldn't care less about astrology, and the great majority of people interested in astrology are blind partisans of it, and "[[pseudoscience]]", an intrinsically POV article, is just waving a red rag in front of a bull.... &#8212; [[User:Bill Thayer|Bill]] 13:27, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Someone reverted "[[pseudoscience]]". First, it's an inherently POV statement: very few of us would call Islam a pseudo-religion, or rock music a pseudo-art. But more to the point in the article Astronomy, there's no need to drag more astrology in here than necessary. It is amply stated, quite correctly, that astronomy is a science, and that astrology is something different. This article is about astronomy, not astrology. It should not be up to the article [[Astronomy]] to define or judge the merits of astrology: that should be done in the article [[Astrology]]. Much of what goes on in that article &#8212; listing of curious claims, famous people purported to have practiced it (who did not) &#8212; merely reflects the insecurity of certain proponents of astrology; similarly, vengeful pursuing of astrology in an article on astronomy has a flavor of insecurity about it too. Why should astronomers care whether astrology is a science, an art, a pseudoscience, or a religion? If you care about this, do it on the article [[Astrology]]. &#8212; [[User:Bill Thayer|Bill]] 00:09, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::I disagree with you here, and will not support your description on this page, as it seems to lend credence to astrology. However, I hope you find my edits an acceptable compromise. Most people know what the term astrology means, and those who do not should be smart enough to follow the link posted. It also maintains the integrity of the page by refering to each field's relationship to the [[scientific method]]. [N.B. I did not make the earlier reversion, although I was tempted]. --[[User:NeilTarrant|NeilTarrant]] 08:15, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::::Neil, that looks perfect to me. It is indeed quite pointless on this page even to offer a thumbnail description of what astrology is &#8212; ''it just doesn't matter'' &#8212; I'd got carried away by the start in that direction which was there before. Who says the Wikipedia process doesn't work? &#8212; [[User:Bill Thayer|Bill]] 11:11, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::::Describing astrology/astromancy as a pseudoscience is factual, not inflammatory. Stating that « astrologers do not [embrace the scientific method] » is nearly synonymous with labeling it as a pseudoscience, so why should it be considered "more neutral"? Use of the term pseudoscience is not subjective (i.e. a POV matter): the pseudoscience article's "Classifying pseudoscience" section gives the criteria that must be met for a discipline to be recognised as pseudoscience &mdash;these are all objective. Still, relegating the debate to the Astrology page is indeed the way to go. :-)
:::::[[User:Urhixidur|Urhixidur]] 16:45, 2004 Oct 28 (UTC)
::::::Describing astrology as ''not embracing the scientific method'' is partisan and POV.  Some astrologers do, some don't.  Nor is it clear that Astrology fits the ''objective criteria'' of the term pseudoscience, after all criterion #1 is "has presented itself as scientific" and again its pretty clear that astrology is internally conflicted on whether it presents itself as scientific or not.  Put these fights on the [[astrology]] page, not the astronomy page.  If I phrased it "Although the two feilds share a common origin, most people on both sides now consider them to be distinct fields. (end of paragraph)" Would that be NPOV enough for everyone? [[User:Bmorton3|Bmorton3]] 21:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC) 

== Function of space telescopes ==

The article currently contains this sentence:

:''Space telescopes are also used to eliminate noise (electromagnetic interference) from the atmosphere.''

To the best of my knowledge this is usually not true, but before I go change it I'd like to give others a chance to explain what I'm missing. To my understanding, space telescopes are used to:

* avoid atmospheric opacity at certain wavelengths
* avoid atmospheric emission at certain wavelengths
* avoid the effects of [[Seeing disk|astronomical seeing]] in the optical band

The quoted sentence occurs in a discussion of infrared telescopes. If thermal infrared is meant, then I reckon the statement is true; see [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and [[IRAS]] for examples of instruments that do not suffer from atmospheric thermal emission (which I suppose is a form of EMI in this context) as a result of being space-borne. However there is also the near infrared, a band in which the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is active, and being spaced-based in this band has nothing to do with avoiding EMI since there are plenty of ground-based near-IR astronomical instruments.

So my question is: Is this just a matter of not distinguishing between near-infrared and thermal-infrared applications? Or is the statement meant to apply to all space telescopes working in either infrared band? In either case, I think the statement needs to be clarified. Look forward to hearing your thoughts about this. [[User:Jeffmedkeff|Jeff Medkeff]] | [[User talk:Jeffmedkeff|Talk]] 08:44, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)

==supernatural?==

Hello, there is a content dispute at [[Methodological naturalism]] that I've filed an article RFC for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Article_RFC:_does_the_scientific_method_use_supernatural_methodologies]

The original question is whether or not the scientific method is a natural method or a supernatural method of scientific investigation. One editor (Markus Schmaus) refuses to allow the scientific method be listed as a natural method unless a link can be provided to support the claim. I assume he is a proponent of [[Intelligent Design]] which pushes the view that ID is "scientific" even though it investigates supernatural causes such as how God must have creaeted life on earth. I assume it is this POV that is getting pushed, and Schmaus will not allow the scientific method be listed as an example of MN because then ID would not fit in the scientific method.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Unsupported_claims_in_lead_section]

In an attempt to resolve the dispute until some sort of consensus was reached, I removed the mention of the Scientific Method as an example of [[methodolgical naturalism]] and instead inserted "astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics" are examples of methodological naturalism. Schmaus is now disputing that these are examples of MN and insists on a URL to prove that they are natural methods rather than supernatural methods of scientific investigation.

Since [[methodological naturalism]] is a minor article with only a few editors, the dispute has remained unresolved for lack of any sort of consensus. Please weigh in with your comments at the following links: 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Article_RFC:_does_the_scientific_method_use_supernatural_methodologies Scientific method is natural or supernatural]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Methodological_naturalism#Unsupported_claims_in_lead_section astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics are natural or supernatural methods]

If you have links to support whether it is supernatural or natural, that would be greatly appreciated. [[User:FuelWagon|FuelWagon]] 18:05, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

* "The [[supernatural]] (Latin: super- "exceeding" + nature) refers to forces and phenomena which are beyond ordinary scientific or any other type of measurement." Ergo, the Scientific method is not supernatural by definition. It's axiomatic. &mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 15:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
: I disagree, super-nature refers to phenomena beyond the realm of "nature" (whatever that means) whether they are measurable or not, or measurable in ordinary ways or not.  So this doesn't settle the fights on the scientific method, again see the extensive work at [[scientific method]].  For that matter numbers and geometeric forms have been considered outstanding examples of supernatural entities in some time periods, and the modern scientific method relies rather heavily on them.  This is simply not a slam-dunk quick fight either way. [[User:Bmorton3|Bmorton3]] 21:20, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

Since this is a high-level summary page, does it make sense to include detailed in-line citations everywhere? I would think those would be found on the drill-down detail pages. Would it make sense to just have a list of good-quality astronomy books, comparable to the list at [[World_War_I#References]]? &mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 15:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

::I thought the same when I saw the "uncited sources" tag.  Unfortunately too, none of the more general science (or arts) pages have been featured so there's little precedent.  But there are a few spots where inline references might be able to be put in:

::*"Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way have demonstrated that the galaxy has more mass than can be accounted for by the visible matter."

== Nature of the article ==

Quick question to those of you who have been here much longer:  is this article about the fields of astronomy, their discoveries, or both?  It mostly seems like both, but some sections (e.g. astrometry) just talk about what the scientists, do whereas others (e.g. galactic astronomy) only talk about discoveries.  Most seem to approach both.  Commentary?--[[User:Will.i.am|Will.i.am]] 00:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

:Both I would think. I'd hope it would be a top-level overview with drill-downs to more detailed pages. Astrometry is probably closer to data collection than to an astronomical subject, so maybe it should be relocated. But it's also about data analysis, so I'm not really sure what's the best place. &mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 20:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion for reorganisation ==

The layout of this article doesn't seem to me to allow it to cover everything it needs to.  I'm not convinced starting with 'divisions' is the best way to go.  I'd like to suggest a possible TOC here, which, if people think it would be good, we could rearrange the article around:

1. History
:1.1 Prehistory to the 17th century
:1.2 Telescopic astronomy
:1.3 Astronomy in the Space Age
2. Astronomical observations
:How objects are observed, with what tools, and what the results are (i.e. images, spectra)
3. Astronomical objects
:3.1 Solar system astronomy
:3.2 Galactic astronomy
:3.3 Extragalactic astronomy
4. Amateur astronomy
:The importance of amateurs - one of the only sciences where they make significant contributions
5. Major questions in astronomy
:Brief summary of some of the biggest issues
6. Refs
7. External links

:::I was sort of mentally putting stars under the galactic astronomy bit, and cosmology in extragalactic, but we could certainly have more subsections there for those.

== Recent changes and GA ==

Hi all, I've been on a vacation lately, but I see that things keep improving here.

== Major questions in astronomy ==

I whacked out a couple of my own entries from this section because they are somewhat speculative in nature. I.e. there have been some hypotheses concerning these questions, but current evidence is mainly in the negative.
* Have the values of the [[physical constant]]s varied over time?
* Does Newton's law of [[gravitation]] hold over long distances? Or can some alternate theory, such as the [[nonsymmetric gravitational theory]], explain the mystery of dark matter?
This entire topic is also somewhat PoV, so I tried to add in some references to back the questions up. But it probably wouldn't hurt to add in a few more. :-)

Are there any other questions that could be added? I think an older major question about whether [[neutrino]]s have mass has already been addressed. Thanks. &mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 16:10, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== History Section ==

Should this article mention about the [[Mayans]]?  Since they were very good astronomers.  And the pyramids that they had for the 8 planets, Sun, and Moon, and one small side small pyramid that was speculated to be Pluto?  Also, their calendar ends on when the Earth is in the galactic plane.  Thanks, [[User:marasama|CarpD]]  (^_^)

:They are mentioned on the [[History of astronomy]] page. Perhaps that section on the Mayans needs expansion? I'd rather see this page focus more on modern astronomy, but that's just my preference. The history section is getting pretty bloated already, considering it's got a main article of its own. That may need some trimming down. :-) &mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 21:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiproject ==
Since articles can be within the scope of multiple wikiprojects I think astronomy should in addition to being within the scope of wikiproject astronomy and wikiproject physics which it already is should also be added to being within the scope of wikiproject mathematics since astronomy is very mathematical and was originally considered part of mathematics not of science even though now it is considered part of science not of mathematics. [[User:Prb4|Prb4]] 21:01:42 February 14, 2007 (UTC)
:Astronomy is as mathematical as physics and all of the other sciences. But I'm not seeing the particular connection to this page. Do you just want an association somewhere on the page? &mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJH]] ([[User_talk:RJHall|''talk'']]) 23:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
Putting an article in a wikiproject does not give that wikiproject ownership over the article. It merely means that that wikiproject has an interest in the article. It is perfectly normal for articles to be within the scope of multiple wikiprojects, e.g., the Nikolai Lobachevsky article is within the scope of wikiproject biography, wikiproject mathematics, and the Russian history wikiproject. The history of mathematics article is within the scope of the history of science wikiproject even though mathematics is not one of the natural sciences. Therefore it would be perfectly ok to put the astronomy article into wikiproject mathematics because astronomy is much more mathematical than most sciences are and it was originally classified as part of math, not part of science until recently when it switched to being considered part of science not part of math. In many respects astronomy is more like math than science. It involves spatial relationships and a lot of geometry and trigonometry. It also involves Euclidean distance. It also involves some complex geometry such as spherical trigonometry. This article should be added to wikiproject mathematics although it should still of course remain in wikiproject physics and wikiproject astronomy as well. 
[[User:Prb4|Prb4]] 1:24:48 February 15,2007 (UTC)

"This WikiProject aimed originally to organize articles in the area of mathematics; in its broadest terms, this may include overlap into the areas of physics, computer science, operations research, and other areas." This is what wikiproject mathematics says about articles that are not about math but are about subjects that involve a lot of math. Therefore it would be legitimate to place the astronomy article within the scope of wikiproject mathematics. [[User:Prb4|Prb4]] 2:28:24  February 15, 2007

:Okay well you're implying things that I never stated, such as "ownership". But don't you think that the project tags are more effective if they are tightly focused on directly-related material?

== Misleading definition in the intro ==

''Astronomy (also frequently referred to as astrophysics)''. Astronomy is, and has always been, much more than astrophysics, as the article quite nicely explains. Backyard astronomy, naked eye observation, celestial navigation, calendars, to name only a few. Although the detailed discussion under "lexicology" elucidates the question, the alleged identity is too questionable, particularly in historical context, to leave it in the very definition. I'd take it out of the intro and leave the question to the second section but would like some more input before I mess with the intro. Thanks. [[User:Kosebamse|Kosebamse]] 06:28, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

== Units of Measurement in Astronomy Articles ==

There have been some gratuitous unit changes in a couple of the Hubble related articles. I don't pretend to know that much about astronomy other than what I have run into while working with Hubble, but it does seem like some reasonable consistency in the use of units might not be a bad idea. Thus I started this discussion: [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Units_on_Astronomy_Pages]] [[User:Dfmclean|Dfmclean]] 13:35, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

== Theory ==

As an Atheist, for a while now I've been searching for a way of putting all things surrounding creation into context.

This is one possible theory that I have been developing which I'd like to discuss.

We have all studied high school chemistry playing with plastic balls and sticks to make models of elements and compounds

For example: [http://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/w-theobromine_3d_mid.jpg] <<Random example

well, the covalent bonds are invisible and are, as I understand a similar force to gravity.

Now take a look at this random solar system picture: 
[http://www.enterprisemission.com/_articles/05-14-2004_Interplanetary_Part_1/Solar%20System.jpg] <<Random example

see any similarity? 

What I'm suggesting is that perhaps on a much greater scale, when we look at a galaxy or a solar system we are in fact looking at a chemical conglomerate, or compound.

This got me thinking further. If this were true, does that offer any explanation to the strange phenomenon in the solar system?

Look at Saturn's asteroid belt for example. Perhaps the belt is an example of an element tending towards equilibrium by attracting negatively charged particles (asteroids) to balance its + latent charge.

So then, how would all this explain life? Is life as most believe similar to bacteria or do we have a larger part to play?

Well Perhaps each planet is also a stable chemical conglomeration. Life on earth for example could be a catalyst or agent in the balancing of whatever chemical compound this planet is.

How would you go about proving a theory such as this? Well I thought that perhaps if you look at the earths main (solids, liquids and gases)chemical components as ratio's

for example:

Carbon 2:Oxygen 1: Hydrogen 1 etc... 

Then also look at what constitutes the moon in same way, and then look at all known chemicals for a similar pattern?

We might be living on a stable carbon monoxide element or something, you don't really know.


Hopefully you can understand all this, It makes more sense than god.

:Hi Nick. As neat as your thoughts are, I don't believe you're supposed to use article talk pages this way, so please limit yourself to discussion related to the article. Thanks. [[User:General Epitaph|General Epitaph]] 03:15, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

:: I understand what you're saying, but it is related to the topic. I just want experts to consider this, because it may help them gain insight into their own science. Imagine if it was true?

He then goes on with: "To this purpose the  philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes."  To which I say GREAT!!!, except for one caveat which is that it appears to me that a lot of physical occurrences including organisms that accurred on earth happened in vain with respect to their category of organism; so I'll paraphrase that to say that Nature does nothing without a reason. But the pursuit of science is rapidly and vastly broadening our knowledge of the reasons for a lot of "occurrences": both good and bad and it behooves us to try to steer our path of (progress?) into areas with a maximum possibility of continued existence. And I hope you'll go along with that.

Yeah, I totally agree with what you said too.

== Why the moon doesnt revolve around sun???? ==

Fact #1   Sun has more attractive power than earth.

Fact #2   Moon is a satelite of earth and it revolves around earth.

Doubt #1     If sun has more atractive power than earth; why moon doesnt get atracted towards sun or revolve around it???

Doubt #2     If sun can make even ploto to revolve atound it, why cant the moon???

<blockquote>
'''Fact #1 Sun has more attractive power than earth.'''
It depends how far you are from the sun or earth.

'''Fact #2 Moon is a satelite of earth and it revolves around earth.'''

'''Doubt #1 If sun has more atractive power than earth; why moon doesnt get atracted towards sun or revolve around it???'''
The moon and the earth both revolve around the sun, and the moon also revolves around the earth.

'''Doubt #2 If sun can make even ploto to revolve atound it, why cant the moon???'''
The gravitational force is directly proportional to the mass from which the gravity originates; because the sun is about 332,918 times as massive as the earth, it produces a gravitational field 332,918 times as strong as the earth's. The gravitational force is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance between any two gravitating objects. If you were to move the earth to a distance twice as far from the sun, the sun would only exert a gravitational force on the earth 1/(2 times 2) = 1/4 as strong; 3x as far, 1/(3 times 3) = 1/9 as strong; etc. Because the moon is closer to the earth than the sun, earth's gravity on the moon is strong enough to make it revolve predominately around the earth. The sun's gravity still tugs on the earth and moon, however; in fact the gravity due to each of the planets and the sun tugs on earth of the other planets, in varying degrees depending on the masses and distances between them. From the formula below, you can see how the [[gravitational force]] <math>F</math> depends both on the mass <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math> of the two attracting bodies and the distance <math>r</math> between them:

<math>F=-\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}</math>,

where <math>G</math> is known as the [[universal gravitational constant]].

The subject matter is the orbital mechanics of the orbits. After the moon's perigee with respect to it's orbit around the sun the moon with mass 1 receives an increase in angular momentum (around the sun) for 13+ days from the earth with mass 81.  This results in the moon speeding up in it's orbit and rising up and over the earth's orbit to its point of apogee. Then for the next 13+ days the moon is slowed back down and the angular momentum is transfered back to the earth.WFPM[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 23:13, 19 May 2008 (UTC)
