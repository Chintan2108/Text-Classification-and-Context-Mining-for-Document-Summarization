A \"league\" can be a generic word meaning an organisation, as in the Temperance League, the Anti-Nazi League or the Canadian Football League, rather than necessarily being a competition. The fact that there was no Premier League prior to 1992, does not mean that that there was no \"league\" in the generic sense.\n\n:Fair enough. dictionary.com says - League - An association of teams or clubs that compete chiefly among themselves. However, to me league suggests a league competition as opposed to a knockout competion, and this didn't appear until the formation of [[The Football League]].\n\n2. Re. the game \"not banned\" in Ireland: I take your point, but the original par speculated that it was a Norman game, which cannot be said with any certainty either.\n:True. Fair to take out the Norman reference altogether. Although I'm sure that I read somewhere about a possible Norman link that led me to write it in the first place.\n\n3. Being very familiar with both Aussie Rules and soccer, I can say out of the 10 substantive Sheffield Rules, only four are at all similar to present day soccer, whereas six are identical or partly similiar to Aussie Rules (not counting the one about caps, although they were worn by Aussie Rules in the early years :-). Of course it doesn't prove a direct link between Sheffield and Aussie Rules, but that's not what I said in the text.\n\n:Ok, ignoring rule 11 about caps, 1,2,6,7,9,10 are all akin to rules in the Association game. Rule 8 can be interpreted as either allowing brief touches of the ball or as banning holding the ball whilst running. For sure these rules could be said to be ancestral to all subsequent games, but they definitely favour the kicking game, but they are a bit of a distraction as far as the Association game is concerned as the rules of Thring and other people at Cambridge were used by the FA.\n\n:: Comments: 1. But it's the absence of offside which makes the Sheffield Rules so different to soccer. 2. Aussie Rules is both \"handling\" and \"kicking\". \n\n4. The fullpointsfooty.net site is an excellent, if still-developing source, in regard to the later history of Aussie Rules, and it's true that the game between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar is a historical red herring. However, Geoffrey Blainey's (1990) A Game of our Own: The Origins of Australian Football (Information Australia, Melbourne) is regarded as fairly authoritative. I don't have a copy with me at the moment but Blainey describes a trial game played by Tom Wills and friends at the \"Richmond Paddock\" in Melbourne on July 31, 1858. There had to be provisional rules for that to occur. Wills (1836-72) had  been educated at Rugby and had played cricket for Cambridge, so he would have been familiar with many varieties of football played in England in the early 1850s. H.C.A. Harrison was Wills's cousin, they were close in 1858, and they were named in 1906 as official \"fathers of the game\", but that does appear to have been generous to Harrison. I will do some more digging on him.\n\n:[http://www.mcg.org.au/history/news6.htm] has this to say about the Richmond Paddock game - \"There were few rules, just men determined to have a kick. Some had experience of football from English public schools, some had no football experience at all. On the same day, Melbourne Grammar School played football against a group of men who called themselves the St Kilda club and the lack of rules caused a fight that ended the game.\". I think this match can be pretty much ignored as far as being a significant date is concerned. It's only real significance is that Wills was involved in it and he was obivously the real driving force behind the development of the Australian game. His influence as you quite rightly point out would have almost certainly been from his experiences in England. Any allusion to a connection between Aussie and Gaelic football is in my opinion a complete red-herring. Aussie rules main influence was clearly the English public school rules, through Wills and presumably others (you yourself point out the similarly between the Aussie rules and the Cambridge rules). I think you definitely have to look at May 1859 with the most significance. In a similar way I have not brought up the fact the Thring and de Winton (both ex-Shrewsbury) established a club with some old Etonians in 1846. They would presumably had some agreed rules to play by.","user":"Mintguy"},{"date":"2004-03-09T20:06:00Z","id":19,"parent_id":0,"section":"General comments on Cambridge, Sheffield & Australian rules","text":"PS: What exactly are the advantages of creating a user account?\n\n[[User:Grant65|Grant65]] [[User talk: Grant65|(T)]] March 9, 2004.\n\nWith an account you get access to certain features that anonymous users don't see [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?]].","user":"Mintguy"},{"date":"2004-03-10T10:40:00Z","id":20,"parent_id":0,"section":"General comments on Cambridge, Sheffield & Australian rules","text":"----\n\nI'm aware of the MCG site -- it's sketchy at best, and overall I don't think it's as factually reliable as it should be. You may interested to know that Blainey also decries the influence of Gaelic (and Marn Grook) on Aussie Rules. However (a big however), the similarities are as plain as the nose on your face, as demonstrated by the \"International Rules\" compromise -- a compromise between either of these games and either rugby or soccer would be impossible.  If you represent the history as a dichotomy between \"kicking\" v. \"handling\" then the above games appear as nothing more than compromises between the two tendencies. However, what contrasts them to the other games more than anything is the total absence of an offside rule; a huge difference. And I'm not aware of anyone explicitly suggesting the opposite: i.e. that the 1884 Gaelic rules came from nowhere, or were influenced by Aussie Rules, Sheffield rules or one of their public school predecessors! Thats would be unlikely, considering the political implications. To me it is far more logical that localised Irish games influenced one or more of the English public school games. (Since the Irish peasantry would not have been as well-travelled as English schoolmasters.)

I had not recognised the significant fact that both Aussie and Gaelic football lack offside rules. The drafting and interpretation of the offside law has always caused problems. The Cambridge off-side rule of 1848, required three players in front of goal. It is significant that the original FA rules of 1863 stipulated only one. When a player has kicked the ball, any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponents' goal line is out of play and may not touch the ball himself nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so until the ball has been played, but no player is out of play when the ball is kicked from behind the goal line. By 1866 the FA had reverted to the Cambridge rule of three players (it remained as such until 1925). The 1857 rules were only adhered to by Sheffield, and apparently the lack of an offside rule was only a temporary state of affairs. According to  The History of the Football Association (1951) an 1866 game between Sheffield and an FA side from London caused problems because the FA wanted to use the three players rule whilst the Sheffield side were using the one player rule. In the end they played two legs with different rules in each game. The published rules of Sheffield FC from 1870 (in the appendix of the above book) show a rule specifically labelled \"offside\". So it appears that the Sheffield 1857 rules (lacking offside) were soon abandoned. Thus the lack of offside in the Sheffield rules is a bit of an anomaly. The club was formed by players from Harrow and Harrow had an offside rule. By 1878 they agreed to not use their own rules anymore and stick with the FA rules. But offside was still causing problems in thr mid 1880s when England played Scotland.\n\nFor sure, now it would be difficult to imagine a compromise set of rules between the association game and rugby, despite the common ancestry, and the similarlity between Aussie rules and Gaelic football is striking. But I just cannot see that there is a real connection. There are so many similarities (right up to the specific wording of the rules) between the first Aussie rules and the early rules devised in England (even the first FA rules include taking a\"mark\"), that there can be little doubt that the public school rules were the major and perhaps exclusive influence. Is the similarly between Gaelic and Aussie footbal simply a case of parrallel evolution. I wonder if the English game had developed without offside would that too have evolved along the same lines as those two games. \n\nSo the question is, why did Wills et al not have offside in their game? He was from Rugby and Cambridge and would have been exposed the offsde rule. Are you suggesting that the Irish in Australia influenced Wills, so that he didn't include offside? I might suggest that since offside is such a contentious and difficult rule to interpret he thought it better to leave it out. As for the Irish game, the \"folk game\" had all but disappeard by the time the GAA drew up their rules (much like the \"mob\" football in England). Their intention was to create a game different to the \"foreign\" (read English) games of rugby and association football, what better way to do this than to avoid the offside rule. You dismiss Gaelic football's connection to the early English games, but Michael Cusack (founder of the GAA) played rugby before becomming disillusioned with the protestant domination of the 'English' games.","user":"Mintguy"},{"date":"2004-03-10T16:27:00Z","id":22,"parent_id":0,"section":"Offside (lack of in Australian, Sheffield and Gaelic rules)","text":"GAA rules of 1887\n:1.There shall not be less than 15 or more than 21 players a side. \n\n:2.

The offside thing could be parallel evolution, but there are too many other similarities between Gaelic and Aussie Rules. Watch one of each and you will see what I mean. Both of them allow handling/running with the ball under certain conditions (bouncing and/or kicking it to oneself). One of the main differences between the two is the absence of tackling in Gaelic (which causes problems in the International Rules games), but Gaelic did allow tackling in its early years. Cusack may have been disillusioned with rugby, but where did he get such a radically different game from, if not from traditional Irish games? That was what the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] was all about. \n\nThere were very large numbers of Irishmen in Victoria in the 1850s, following the [[History_of_Ireland#The_nineteenth_century|Famine]] of 1847-51 and the Australian goldrushes (see [[Australia#Demographics]]) from 1851. Wills may have seen them playing their own varieties of football. But, as I said above: \"To me it is far more logical that localised Irish games influenced one or more of the English public school games. (Since the Irish peasantry would not have been as well-travelled as English schoolmasters at least before 1847.) Of course there is probably no way of proving this.\" That is, the relationship may have occurred indirectly, by way of now-forgotten public school games, based on Irish versions of \"football\".

There were several variations of Irish football in existence, normally without the benefit of rulebooks, but the central tradition in Ireland was in the direction of the relatively new game [i.e. rugby]...adapted and shaped within the perimeters of the ancient Irish game of hurling. This involved punching the ball rather than throwing it, bouncing and toeing it in the process of running ... [and] having no limitation on ball movement or team placement in the absence of any offside rule. They later became embedded in Gaelic football.

A meeting of the game's supporters at Woollahra in June 1880 was well-attended and, according to the Sydney Mail's football writer, 'Leather-stocking', a clear indication of the dis-satisfaction with rugby among Sydney footballers: It is pretty well understood... that there are scores of footballers ... who play the Rugby game under protest as it were, and who would gladly welcome a radical change in the present method of playing football. A week later over 100 footballers formed the New South Wales Football Association (NSWFA), to play under the VFA's [Australian] rules. The president of the new body was Philip Sheridan, the Irish born manager of the Association Cricket Ground. \n\nThe following month another group of footballers met to form an association to play under English Association rules, and, although soccer would not threaten either rugby or the Australian game (although it did in Newcastle [New South Wales]), the meeting is of interest here in that it reflects the antipathy of rugby supporters toward the Australian game. Senior rugby officials warmly welcomed the introduction of soccer which they believed would improve the skills of rugby players. Indeed, there was only one dissenter at the meeting, a committeeman with the NSWFA, F. Lyons. In a speech he declared that: as the colonies in many matters, political and social, had struck out a path for themselves, he did not see why the same line of conduct should not be adopted in the game of football. While averring that he had as much respect for British institutions as anyone else, Weiss claimed that people in New South Wales were 'quite as capable of judging the merits of the game as they were in England'.\"\n\n[A great demonstration of the struggles over, and flux of, the word football, that in Sydney in 1880, it could mean three different games!]\n\nCheers,","user":"Grant65"},{"date":"2004-10-16T08:59:00Z","id":77,"parent_id":0,"section":"Rutgers Vs.

He says it was nothing like soccer. I disagree, I say it's more like soccer than today's American football, but there also may have been elements of rugby in there. So I put down \"football (or soccer) \" in place of \"football\", and we got into a dispute about it (even though I'm a Rutgersman myself). Rickyrab 06:50, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n\nPerhaps you should do some research, like I did long ago.  Being a Rutgers student, you should know well enough where to find things in Alexander.  Do you see any mentions of \"soccer\" as the inspiration for \"football\" on the Rutgers timeline (check the link on the RU article)?  NO.  Why?  Because \"soccer\" had nothing to do with the founding of the game.  If you read newspapers, histories of the event, all of them point to Rugby, and that the rules were altered from English Rugby rules.  You will also see in those sources accounts of the game that to any simpleminded reader would say \"Hey, this isn't soccer.\"\n\nTo Rickyrab (and for the edification of Grant65)...The Princeton/Rutgers rivalry in football died in 1980.

ExplorerCDT 07:30, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)\n:ExplorerCDT, I think I'm unbiased because I knew nothing about this particular match in 1869 until several months ago. Then I did a lot of research, on the web and in books, before writing the section on US/Canadian football. Nothing I've seen suggests they were playing a game like American football as we know it, or rugby either. For example, the feature which identifies rugby and US football as \"cousins\" is the players being allowed to hold the ball and run with, it as far as they like.

Despite the contribution of the British punk band, Wat Tyler, soccer is a word that is used in Britain. At the moment the article reads as if soccer is an American English word, which it is not. When I was at school, one was invited to play a game of RUGger or SOCCer. This was probably because the emphasis is on the first syllable and so the second syllable could be mumbled -- something which teenagers tend to do, and this is harder to do with rugBEE and FootBall (hence another slang terms like \"footer\" and \"footy\" ).\n\nPerhapse [[Charles Wreford-Brown]] deserves a mentioned even if only along the lines of [[William Webb Ellis]]. How accurate are these descriptions and how well known is the history of the word soccer?\n\nhttp://worldsoccer.about.com/od/soccercoaching/l/bl_sochist.htm\n:Football or Soccer? - In the 1880's, Oxford University students used slang which involved adding an \"er\" to the end of words they had deliberately shortened. \"Rugger,\" was slang for Rugby Football. A student, named Charles Wreford Brown, was asked if he liked to play rugger. 'No soccer!' Was his witty reply He had shortened asSOCiation (football) and added \"er.\" The term was coined!\n\nhttp://www.rsssf.com/rssbest/whysoccer.html\n:Near the end of 1863, Charles Wreford-Brown, who later became a notable official of the Football Association, was asked by some friends at Oxford whether he cared to join them for a game of \"rugger\" (rugby). He is said to have refused, preferring instead to go for a game of \"soccer\"  - a play on the word \"association\". The name caught on. English public schoolboys love to nickname things, then as much as now.  The tendency is to add \"er\" to the end of many words.  Rugby [Union] Football became \"rugby\", and then \"rugger\".  Association Football was better know as \"assoccer\" and naturally evolved into \"soccer\" which is much easier for a schoolboy to say... Therefore, the word \"soccer\" has been used in the mother country of all football-type games since at least the mid-19th century.  The word \"football\", however, was more descriptive of the game (i.e. kicking a ball with the feet!) and was the term more frequently used.\n\n--","user":"Philip Baird Shearer"},{"date":"2005-03-04T18:16:00Z","id":86,"parent_id":0,"section":"Name change","text":"Considering that by and large, the world use of the term \"football\" isnt anywhere as disambiguous as this article presents, given that this article goes heavily into lesser used variants...\nProposed:\n move  [[Football]]  >>  [[Football history]]\n move  [[Football (Soccer)]]  >>  Football\nThe real reason is simple categorization.

By the normal definition of age, it is older than American football or Gridiron, older than Rugby League, older than the modern version of Gaelic Football from which it is widely said to have been descended, a little older than Association Football or Soccer, but younger than Rugby.  Few of the world's famous football clubs, irrespective of the specific code they play, are as old s the senior Australian football clubs such as Melbourne, Geelong and Carlton.  Even young clubs in the Victorian Football League such as Fitzroy and Footscray are older than any football club in such celebrated sporting nations as Italy and Germany and Argentina.\n\nI know from personal experience that rugby diehards from either rugby code have trouble with this notion:  they have trouble believing that Aussie rules was codified in [[1859]] and that [[Melbourne Football Club]], formed in the same year, is older than virtually every other football club of any code on [[Earth]].  So for an article that is about the origins of the modern football codes, and their early inter-connectedness, Aussie rules has an important place in that.  Also, remembering that the initial tension of the early forms of football was between running with the ball and kicking it, Australian and Gaelic football occupy an interesting middle road between these two early footballing philosophies, and thus a discussion on football generally is not complete without them.  But don't take my word for it, I encourage you to do your own research.

Again I call for a non-Australian person interested in all codes of football to help re-write this.\n\n12:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)[[User:Licinius|Licinius]]\n\n*Please do some research on the state of football in the 1850s, and then come back and chat here because you will soon understand the prime position Australian rules has in the history of the modern football codes.  This is an article about football generally - it is not an article about the world's most popular football (which we all accept is soccer).  [[Association Football]] has its own article.  The genesis of all the modern football codes is in what was happening amongst the English public schools of the 1850s and the tension between the two main philosophies.  Aussie rules is a direct child of this period - its founders were all educated in the English public school system so they brought back with them some knowledge of all the various rules, including Rugby, and it shows - that is what makes it of interest in a history on football (generic term).  I simply ask you to compare what was happening in 1859 in terms of Aussie rules (codification of the rules and formation of the Melbourne Football Club - events of which original documents survive to the present day) and what was happening anywhere else in the world regarding any football code you care to mention.

(The top six are Melbourne 1858, Geelong 1859, Notts County 1862, Stoke City 1863, Carlton 1864, Nottingham Forest 1865).\n:\"Middle-aged\" AFL clubs like Essendon and St Kilda are older than any senior clubs in Germany and Argentina. A \"young\" club like Collingwood (1892) is older than any Italian soccer club, and Port Adelaide (1870) older than any Brazilian club.\n:I repeat, in an article that covers the history of football, including (in particular) the history of its organisation, its institutions, its rules, etc.  the fact that the Australian football clubs are so old in world terms is certainly of note and should be mentioned in this article.  In fact I note that a list of the oldest football clubs in the world is not shown, and I wonder whether it should be squeezed in somewhere (not sure where).  Certain contributors to this talk page (and I use that term reservedly) should note the age of the Port Adelaide footy club:  [[1870]], which is extremely old in its own right, and hopefully is another wet blanket on the lie that Australian Football is merely a Victorian game (I know, even it it were, it is still Australian, but don't tell me, tell you know who...).

My Chambers Dictionary (which I believe is British) defines Football as 1 any of several team games played with a large ball... 2 the ball used in the game.  Then my 1969 Columbia Encyclopedia refers to Football in terms of what it means in the USA (i.e. Gridiron) with barely a sentence dedicated to other codes.  However, it does have an entry for Soccer:  outdoor ball and goal game, also called Association Football.  So, what do I conclude from this?  In an English language wikipedia we are correct in only ever using the term [[Football]] as a generic word to describe a variety of related games - the fact that much of the world thinks football is only soccer is irrelevant - this is the English language wikipedia.  Secondly, the round ball game has two very good names to describe it, both of which will be found in all the major sources, but adherents don't want to use either of them.  Why?  It can only be because of a desire to appropriate the broader term completely for their own use.  In both historical and contemporary terms (in the English speaking world), this is an incorrect use of the term.  Arguing that football = Association football only is a bit like arguing that music = classical music only.  Many will try and say it, but it is not correct.

The descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. The different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their \"ancestry\" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin.

For instance, at that time there was still a lot of ball handling allowed in Association Football, and aussie rules was yet to settle on the shape of the ball (basically because balls were not mass produced and you played with whatever you could get your hands on).  Also, the aussie rules of that era would have been virtually indistinguishable from the rugby of the era.

Bambride (Marlborough College) in The Field (March 10) final submission was made. One set of laws, that promulagated by the Football Association, was at last accepted. However, the Sheffield Association had the satisfaction of knowing that finality was only acieved after the incorporation of ideas from Sheffield.\"\n\nI haven't any reliable sources yet but it also seems that Sheffield Rules were also played by a number of teams outside south Yorkshire, which is why having the two codes became such a major issue.

England played a 1-1-8 formation, in which whoever had the ball would dribble at the opponents and kick it up field before he was tackled. One of the seven forwards, following behind, would then chase the ball.\n\nScotland played with a 2-2-6 system, with three banks of forwards divided into pairs. Each pair of players - in defence, midfield and attack - knew who their partner was and their job was to pass to them when possible. This revolutionary tactic of 'passing and running' was known as the combination game\n\nThe rules of football in England were decided in the public schools where individualism was an important factor. In Scotland, it was a societal thing. There was no class bias in football and everyone grew up playing the game in the streets. Queen's Park were made up of 13 young men from between Aberdeen and Inverness who came to Glasgow to get white-collar work in banks and commerce. They formalised the team in July 1867, a time when Clydeside was producing one quarter of the world's ships and railways.\n\nAfter the game, English players returned home to tell of Scotland's combination game. Soon hundreds of Scots - known as 'Scotch Professors' - were playing in England. Preston North End fielded eight Scots in one team while Liverpool were founded in 1892 with eleven Scots.\n\nI'd like to add this somewhere as it seems like it was a fairly important development in the sport.

But I seriously doubt there is a strong historical link.  You're right that I am influenced by Blainey's book  - but the arguments he puts forward stack up quite well in my mind.  Ultimately, the clincher for me is that going back to 1858, it was English public school types that were putting together our code - I really doubt that the Irish would have had much of a look in, or at least, knowledge of any pre-existing Irish game would have had no more greater influence than the knowledge they had of Rugby school rules, Cambridge rules, etc. (certainly no disrespect intended to the Irish game either, which I think is a great game) [[User:Pippu d'angelo|πίππύ δ'Ω∑]] - [[:scn:User talk:Pippu d'Angelo|(waarom? jus'b'coz!)]] 04:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)\n::::One may state without much contention, if done from honest analysis, that aussie rules is in fact a variation of soccer's forerunner [[Cambridge Rules]].

The sheer amount of evidence for this is overwhelming, when considered that most of the original writers were in fact attendants of the cambridge college and the rugby school. Gaelic, on the other hand, seems more a rejection of soccer and rugby. Irish immigrants in Sydney, New York and Manchester all took up rugby with gusto, so there is perhaps more relationship between traditional Irish [[caid]] and rugby, though there is no proof or logic to asserting any realistic direct Irish influence on the fundamentals of the Melbourne game, perhaps there is through the webb ellis myth.

I think it's easy for us to forget that  as late as the 1870s  there were scores of different kinds of football. The Cambridge Rules certainly were an important influence. In fact, Australian rules did have kicking off until (if memory serves me correct) the 1880s. Possibly the strongest proponent of the view that Irish games did not influence Tom Wills and other progenitors of the Melbourne game is the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]]. However, I had another look at Blainey's book [[A Game of Our Own]] today and his coat is slung on a rather more slender logical hook than many of his admirers may imagine: first, he states that those involved in the match/meeting organised by Wills on July 31, 1858 played a variety of football codes. Second, his argument rests on the fact that few Irish Catholics played Australian rules before the 1880s; indeed Blainey states that they preferrred to play [[hurling]] and regarded the new code as a \"Protestant game\". The irony is, that in doing so he affirms that hurling, an Irish sport with no offside rule (like Australian rules and the later Gaelic football) was reasonably widespread in Victoria at an early stage. And if hurling was there, why not caid? Also, it is neither here nor there whether Irish people played Australian rules  Tom Wills & co had only to witness hurling, caid or whatever to be influenced by them. Finally  and I was surprised to notice this for the first time  Blainey provides no references or bibliography in his book!

Firstly, Ireland ought to be included in those countries listed whereby football (often) refers to another sport other than Association Football (Soccer). In rural areas, the term Football soley refers to Gaelic Football and the Irish media use a convention whereby Association Football is referred to as 'Soccer' and Gaelic Football as just that.\n\nThe origins of Gaelic Football predate the 19th Century as the post implies. This addition ought to be made:\n\nThe first mention of football in [[Ireland]] is found in 1308, where John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at Newcastle, [[County Dublin]] was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.\n\nThe Statute of Galway of 1527 allowed the playing of \"foot balle\" and [[archery]] but banned \"'hokie' [sic]  the [[hurling]] of a little ball with sticks or staves\" as well as other sports. However even \"foot-ball\" was banned by the severe Sunday Observance Act of 1695, which imposed a fine of one [[shilling]] (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports. It proved difficult, if not impossible for the authorities to enforce the Act and the earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]], at [[Slane]], in 1712.\n\nThe first references to the nature of play was in 1670: the ball may be held and struck either hand or foot. Often referred to as peil (see modern Peil Gaelach).\n\nFootball was thought to have been introduced into Ireland by the Normans in the 12-13th centuries and was predominantly played in the south and east of the country. There were no references to Football in the Brehon Laws (Fénechas).\n\nCaid refers not to a specific code of football but the equipment used i.e. the ball. The Field Game as it was played in Kerry was the principal basis for that code of football played by the Limerick club, Commercials, upon which Maurice Davin is thought to have drawn inspiration. It was a pitch-based, field game composed of two opposing teams that took turns defending a 'goal', which comprised the boughs of two stripped trees tied to one another in the characteristic 'H'. Different scores were indicated depending upon whether the ball was driven above or below the bar.\n\nGaelic Football is similar to Australian-Rules Football, although their common origin is disputed. What is not in dispute, however, is that the Irish of Victoria played football (noted in 1843). Also, most Irish convicts at that time were either Rebels (or their descendents) from the 1798 Rebellion and thus predominantly from the south-east of Ireland.  —Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Martan32|Martan32]] ([[User talk:Martan32|talk]] •","user":"Martan32"},{"date":"2007-11-29T14:24:00Z","id":520,"parent_id":0,"section":"Wrong","text":"[[Image:DoNotFeedTroll.svg|frame|right|float|Please do not feed the trolls.]]\n\"football\" is used in english-speaking countries to refer to a sport.

Leotolstoy suggests a vote and my opinion is that undisputed information can be made out without the dispute.</br> I am pointing out the absurdity (thanks to the Shudde for the word) of misleading description. You might not appreciate it.</br> The game of [[Gaelic Football]] closely follows a foot ball game being that the foot and the ball are required in the game play. The rules are to carry the ball but you must use your foot. It is basically a high contact, hand ball game but the foot is required by rules and is most commonly used to attempt scoring but the contact rules are much less permissive than other [[rugby style games]]. [[Aussie rules]] might be in between Gaelic and Rugby regarding contact rules(or at least they seem to be when they are playing Gaelic rules).</br> Who knows the [[rules of rugby]] and would finish a try with the ball on your foot? No you wouldn't know the rules then. Hand ball is not only permitted but the rule is hand on ball or no score. I didn't have to look it up. I learnt it. Foot is allowed and free kicks seem to be taken with the foot but aside of mobility, foot is not such an essential part of the game play otherwise. I don't know if you can score between the bars with out a free but that will be irrelevant for this. The other rugby style games also require foot in some large part but are primarily hand ball wrestling games. This is relevant in any description therfore should be acknowledged on this page (it is not and that lacks something [[fundamental]]).</br> The fact they display their inspiration from football in the sport names and even the name of the ball should not be misrepresented or discarded as it is like displaying their colours and those games are a big part of sport as we know it.</br> Football is, surprisingly, unique in this variety of football games that it uses the foot and the ball primarily with rules governing contact and obstruction. This is considered extremely distinctive and [[requires ackowledgement]]. Hands are allowed in football for goal keeping but this fits into the game without lessening the basis distinguishing the styles.</br> Football is the primary of these sports in popularity and history (look through [[Football|the page]] for instance) and so inspiring in this regard that hand based ball sports worldwide are most often named (regional) foot ball. Some exceptions including basketball (with the basket), baseball (bases), volleyball (volley the ball), cricket (er..ribbet), and handball itself. It is an indicator of fond the esteem of the football basis and should be treated as such and acknowledged boldly.</br>  Some refer to a game [[of]] football and some refer to a game [[with]] [[a]] football. Rugby style football games are based on a form of [[wrestling]]. It seems that until these sort of facts are acknowledged around this page people are going to dispute its contents. Wrestling with a football - it's as valid as any other style of game I can think of, wrestling, football, or anything bar racing. I can't imagine any lovers of these games being dissapointed with that description of them and the disputes here dont go much into wether or not football is football but rather wether rugby or such is football. That school of thought also has a place in acknowledgment on a correct and concise page (if not what is the point?).</br> The brief description 'These games involve:' does not acknowledge the contact style which distinguishes the games for any fan. That is absurd and incitful to provocation. Some people hear that obvious information is kept back and they fight and die hoping to correct it.</br> As for refering it as 'Association Football' it has to be acknowledged that these days that is old hat and it is and will be FIFA football (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) since a long time back and will be as far as anyone beleives so in this opinion. FIFA being represented only by a mention of 5 a side on this page only is not only [[piss poorly disappointing]] but it is [[misleading]] like the rugby relation. What about [[Masters Football]]? If these facts were made out correctly there would be less gripes on the page and it would be more apparent that soccer was a name to suit a non football area where football was not seen as the more common football sport. Grant should know that only the English can represent the vast majority of [[native]] English speakers and that the English language includes the word [[greeble]] picked out at random.</br> The issue of naming football as soccer only applies to informing people that football is the more widely accepted name.

Some 2,500 years ago the Chinese played a form of it called Tsu chu, in which they kicked a ball of stuffed leather. Natives of Polynesia are known to have played a variation of the game with a ball made of bamboo fibres, while the Inuit had another form using a leather ball filled with moss. However, much of the game's development came about in England where it was first known in the 12th century. It became so popular that kings, including Edward II and Henry VI, tried to ban it on the grounds that it distracted men from the necessary military duty of regular archery practice. Such edicts had little effect.\n\nVarieties developed in England and in Europe (in 14th-century Florence there was a form called calcio). A traditional version in England was known as Shrovetide football, common in the Midlands and the north of England for centuries. Such games might involve hundreds of men on each side and were usually a free-for-all between sections of a town, villages, or adjoining parishes that would often develop into a brawl. Many schools played football and some, notably Eton, Harrow, Winchester, and Rugby, evolved codes of their own, particularly Rugby, which established a code from which others (American football, for example) developed. During the 19th century there were concerted efforts to organize and structure the different forms and provide acceptable rules.\n\"</br>\nhttp://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570265/Football.html\n/br>\"The Greek 'Episkyros' - of which few concrete details survive - was much livelier, as was the Roman 'Harpastum'. The latter was played out with a smaller ball by two teams on a rectangular field marked by boundary lines and a centre line. The objective was to get the ball over the opposition's boundary lines and as players passed it between themselves, trickery was the order of the day. The game remained popular for 700-800 years, but, although the Romans took it to Britain with them, the use of feet was so small as to scarcely be of consequence.\n\"</br>\n\nhttp://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame1.html\n</br>\n\"Tlatchi was a game played by the Aztecs and some individuals have claimed that it is over 3000 years old. We cannot verify this but it is quite possible that the game was being played around 500 BCE. This would make it older than the Chinese game of Tsu Chu. However Tlachtli was more a mix of basketball, volleyball and football rather than just a forerunner of football. One key rule was that players could not use their hands, although they could use their heads, elbows, legs or hips(?).\n\n\nThe ruins of almost every ancient city include a walled court for the sacred game of Tlachtli. The courts were often close to temples, reinforcing the spiritual nature of the game. Tlatchi has been described as a spectator sport, an astrological study and a political engagement all at the same time. \n\nThe sense of astrology comes from the fact that the Aztecs and particularly the priests felt that the movement of the rubber ball during the game symbolised the future path of the sun. \n\nGreat prominence was given to the mystic similarities between ball and sun.Only the ruling elite were allowed to watch the game and gambling on the outcome of the game was very popular. Money, clothes and even slaves were bet on games.\n\nTlachtli was played in a sunken stone walled court surrounded by fans. The court was normally an 'I' or 'H' shape with one stone ring at each end of the court. (The stone rings were similar to basketball hoops and were 8-10 feet off the ground. The actual hole was less than 30 cm wide.\n \n\nThe actual game involved passing the ball from side to side without it touching the ground. If the ball fell to the ground on the other side your team would win a point and vice versa (similar to volleyball.) If you struck the ball with an incorrect part of your body you could lose points for your team.\n\nHowever the real purpose of the game was to get the ball through the hoop at each end.

However, it permitted bouncing the ball, rolling the ball, passing the ball, smuggling the ball, and wrestling for the ball.  'Wrestling' means you had to punch or pry the ball out of the bearer's arms, sometimes with the assistance of a team member trying to twist the guy's arm away, to make him let go, and you only had up to the count of ten to do so.  Tackling and tripping was permitted.  It was a good idea to wear a helmet because it was a little rough.  You didn't have to be the guy carrying the ball to be in danger of being tackled, as anybody could tackle anybody, even members of your own team.  As for [[Rugby football|Rugby]], I don't exactly understand the terms [[ruck]] or [[maul]], so I will simply leave that term to others, so they can go back to those articles so they can describe those terms better.\n\nFor one thing, does Rugby or [[Gaelic Football]] have Referees who are supposed to count to ten (very loudly) when a battle for possession begins?  Flashball does.\n\nTo start the game, the opposing teams lined up on opposite ends of the field.  Then the Referee would walk out and into the middle of the field, and throw the football towards the team that had fewer team members (thus allowing uneven numbers of players to play against each other).  Anybody could snatch it up, and take off running with it, hopefully making it through the opposing team as they gathered to take him down.  More often than not, one or more opposing team members would take him down and attempt to bury the ball.  But he could pass or bounce the ball out of harm's way, such that his comrades could pick it up, and take off running with it.  The ball has to be buried till the count of ten, at which point the Referee declares which team was in \"possession\" of the ball.  It helps to have reversible [[T-shirt]]s because the Referee would say something like, \"Blue has the Ball\" or \"Red has the Ball\" depending on who had the ball more firmly immobilized.  If the ball rolls out of the mass of wrestling players, the Referee shouted \"Ball in Motion.\"  If the ball comes to rest without any players in possession of it, then the Referee (after counting to ten) shouts out the name of the team most properly (that is, previously) in possession of the ball.\n\nAside from the initial throw of the ball by the Referee to the team that needed a break, the rest of the game was played by lining up the team members and hiking the ball, and then running it to the other side of the field.  You generally don't line up to \"hike the ball\" until the Referee blows on his whistle, after which, any players who are still wrestling in some other part of the field (not realizing that they were no longer in possession of the ball) are supposed to stop what they are doing, and come line up for the hike.\n\nAs I understand it, dropping the ball and kicking it over the goalie line doesn't count for any points.  You actually had to physically transport or carry the ball over the goal line for it to count.\n\nIf opposing players were to rush the ball before it was hiked, the Referee had authority to penalize that team, and make them backup 5 yards, and everybody had to line up again.  Unnecessary roughness (like punching somebody in the ribs, when you were simply trying to punch the ball out of somebody's arms) was another reason for a penalty.  (And similarly for \"accidentally\" spraining somebody's fingers when he won't let go of the ball, and two or three people are simultaneously trying to make him let go.  If you have that many people wrestling for the ball, any sane man will toss the ball before it comes to that.)\n\nIt was okay to tackle anybody you wanted, this being an interesting ploy for a more numerous team to employ against a less numerous team, inasmuch as two players could be taken down for the price of one.  Unlike Rugby, there was no duty to move away from the ball after tacking the bearer.  The game goes fast enough, that it isn't always immediately clear which player has the ball.  Having one Referee is mandatory, but having two Referees is even better.  As I seem to recall, eight touchdowns (carrying the ball physically over the goal line, and touching it to the ground) made a game.","user":"198.177.27.22"},{"date":"2007-02-17T11:06:00Z","id":558,"parent_id":557,"section":"They called it Flashball in 1974 but what do you call it?","text":"Hi, thanks for your contribution.

That is not exactly controversial. As examples, the original goalposts were identical to the goalposts in Cambridge Rules and the original soccer rules, the pitch dimensions (that now to seem to individualise Ozzie Rules) were originally in the dimensions Cambridge Rules, running with the ball was like such in Rugby and the marks were a universal feature of all the football codes at that point in time.

Rugby union paid their players through shamateurism etc. and rugby league with contracts. Neither of them were full time professionals except for mega teams like Brisbane. When Rupert Murdoch started the superleague concept, the payments guaranteed the players full time professionalism across the board for the first time. The NSWRU was forced to act because on this basis they would of lost all of their players as it was the first time that rugby league had the money to put the under threat. So within 2 weeks(from memory, maybe it was a little bit longer) of the super league war breaking out, the NSWRU declared that they were now professionals.

I am not sure that soccer should even be on a page in English wikipedia dedicated to football and think that people should remove it. Afterall, outside of a few imperialists, everyone in Australia hates the d***heads that are trying to call soccer football, and even more importantly, the Americans dont do it either, leaving the English on their lonesome. I tried to change this but I cant for some reason so I would like someone who can to change it. Think about it, football means ball on foot in every English speaking society that is not bitched by the English culturally. In particular, [[rugby football]] and its varying splinters stand out as the clearest meaning of the term football. like [[rugby league football]], [[rugby union]], [[American football]], [[Canadian football]]. With gayfl, many of the original writers went to the rugby school and they were heavily influenced by the tour of the English football team to Australia in 1877, as well as them being undoubtedly influenced by the culturally superior and more densely populated states of NSW and QLD where rugby football is a religion. With Gaelic football, it was probably influenced by rugby football in the type of its posts. The only mention to soccer should be that it deviated from football in 1863 when it changed the emphasis of the game to kicking, and stopped being football when the average player was no longer allowed to catch the ball on foot and take a \"mark\". I mean, look in a dictionary at the words that have the adjectival foot- as the beginning of the word and most of them only make sense when you add by, with, in, on, from before the foot, like footmarch means a march on foot, or footnote means a note on foot (of page) whereas football could only mean soccer when you add the verb kick, as in ball kicked by foot/with foot, so it breaks the rule. In other cases like footstep meaning step FOR foot, it still does not give clarification for it meaning soccer ahead of rugby football, as ball for foot is ambiguous and is probably not the origin of the word, as the word was used for a sport originally and ball is not a sport. So that is why soccer should be kicked off the football page and I am insulted in the opening mention to it being the most popular form without giving the clarification that only the pommys call it football(and even than it has only become universal in the past 50 years, whereass before that clubs like Wigan FC definitely didnt play soccer and didnt compromise over the fact that they were a football club). So please change it somebody when they get the chance, and while we are at it, change the name of the soccer article. --","user":"Poo thrasher"},{"date":"2007-10-08T16:47:00Z","id":624,"parent_id":623,"section":"Insulting","text":"Soccer isn't played on foot?

I refer to the statement below:-\n\n\"However, in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, use of the word \"football\" by soccer bodies is a recent change and has been controversial.\"\n\nDid the person who wrote this piece actually do any research? The New Zealand Football Association was formed in 1891 and continued to use this name until 1995, when they first changed to Soccer New Zealand, then to New Zealand Soccer. After eleven years they went back to football, and are now known as New Zealand Football. There was no controversy, the national league competition was already called the New Zealand Football Championship and as NZF's chief executive, Graham Seatter said:-\n\n“It’s interesting that when the New Zealand Football Association went to Soccer New Zealand and then New Zealand Soccer that most clubs stayed as ‘football clubs’…… many people in New Zealand call it football so we need to acknowledge that.” \n\nAs someone who comes from New Zealand and have lived all my life 'down under', I ask where was the controversy? There was none.\n\nFor many years, the governing body in Australia was known as the Australian Football Association, they too have simply gone back to using football. \n\nThe two weekly Australian publications, 'Australian Football Weekly' and 'British Football Week' are publications that both deal with Association Football. Go to Australian website 'Fox Sports' (the official website of the tv channel of the same name), click on Football and you will get Association Football, not Rugby Union, not Rugby League, not Australian Rules\nor any other game, but Association Football. 'SBS', another Australian television network, also use the name 'Football' for Association Football. \n\nBack here in New Zealand, go to the (New Zealand) 'Sky Sport' website (the official website of the tv channel), click on Football and again you will get Association Football, not Rugby Union, not Rugby League or any other game, but Association Football. Go to 'TVNZ Sport' website and click on Football and surprise surprise you again get Association Football. Still\nnot convinced? Pick up New Zealand Newspapers, 'Sunday News', 'Sunday Star Times', 'The Dominion Post' etc turn to the Football and what do you get? You guessed it, Association Football.\n\nMost fans in both Australia and New Zealand prefer to call Association Football by the name of Football. In both countries it is the fans of the other codes that prefer to call Association Football by the name of Soccer.\n\nAnother statement used in the article:-\n\n\"The name \"soccer\" (or \"soccer football\") was originally a slang abbreviation of the word \"association\" from \"association football\" and is now the prevailing term in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand where other codes of football are dominant.\"\n\nActually, Association Football is the most played sport in New Zealand. 198,757 people play Association Football in New Zealand (source: FIFA), while only 136,059 people play Rugby Union (source: NZRU).\n\nThere are plenty in Ireland that call the game football. Organisations: 'Football Association of Ireland', 'Football League of Ireland' (now known as 'FAI League of Ireland'), 'Football Association of Irish Schools', 'Leinster Football Association', 'Munster Football Association' and clubs are called 'Football Clubs'. Media: there has been 'The Irish Football Handbook', 'Irish Football Online', Irish writer, Roddy Doyle refers to the game as Football, as does other Irish writers / journalists, Declan Lynch, Dermot Bolger, Roisin Ingle, Marie Jones etc etc. Also the comedy 'Father Ted' also called the game Football. \n\nAlso in the United States, many ESPN commentators call the game Football. So to all those who think the UK is alone in being the only English speaking country that uses Football and not Soccer, think again. Also the former British West Indies countries and English speaking African countries also call Association Football, by the name of Football.","user":"Footballworldworldfootball"},{"date":"2009-06-03T02:03:00Z","id":686,"parent_id":0,"section":"Use of the word \"football\" in English-speaking countries","text":"The only ESPN anchors that ever call soccer \"football\" are the guys who cover English football when they play it.

The Football figure that is used on their website (105,000) is the one used by SPARC NZ back in 2002/03 and is for male footballers only (it also appears that it is only an estimate rather than an exact figure). However the rugby union figure (136,059) is the one used by the NZRU in 2007 and is for both sexes. According to FIFA, even back in 2000 New Zealand had 136,048 Association footballers (total for both sexes). The figure for Rugby Union players according to the NZRU in 2000-01 was 129,869. The latest figures from FIFA say that New Zealand now has 198,757 Association footballers while the IRB say that New Zealand now has 139,968 Rugby Union players.

The main opposition arguments from previous discussion (apart from \"this has been discussed before\") seem to be the following:\n* any disambiguation would eventually swell up to be as large as the current article.\n* the current introduction already points anyone who's strayed here by mistake towards whichever article they intended to get to.\nNow, it seems to me that you can't have it both ways. Either what need to be disambiguated is the small list of sports given in the opening paragraph; or else it's the huge list in the \"Present day codes and families\" section and subsections; but not both.  For my money, the small list is the necessary one. I've mocked up a disambiguation page at [[User:Jnestorius/Football]].  \n\nWith such a disambiguation page available, this current Football article could be moved and split into:\n* [[History of football]]; made from [[Football#History]]\n* [[List of football codes]]; made from [[Football#Present day codes and families]]. There is no need to add all of the list entries to the disambiguation page; [[WP:DPAGES]] says \"Only add links to articles that could use essentially the same title as the disambiguated term.\" which doesn't apply to  [[beach soccer]], [[arena football]], [[futsal]], et al; while someone might refer to the game as \"football\" in a certain context where it's already obvious what game they're referring to, nobody could seriously consider \"football\" to be the name of the game.\n\nThere is an additional problem that can't be addressed with the current setup: mistargeted wikilinks. [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Football]], excluding redirects and transclusions, has over 3000 inlinks. My guess is that many of those really ought to point to [[association football]]/[[American football]]/etc rather than this page; but it would be quite tedious to check them all. OTOH, if \"football\" was a simple disambiguation page, then practically all WhatLinksHere would be misdirections, so it would be a minor housekeeping task to fix them as they arise. Currently, if an editor erroneously types <nowiki>[[football]]</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>[[association football|football]]</nowiki>, then unless it's picked up quickly it will be lost among the 3000 inlinks. \n\nThere's some really good information on this page, and in a sense it would be a pity if readers bypassed it by being routed through a vanilla disambiguation page. However, it's not the place of editors to force readers to read something they're not looking for; instead, we must minimise the delay between searching for an article and finding it; I think the current structure is flawed. I don't know the details of querying Wikipedia's HTTP traffic, but it would be interesting to see how many readers get to [[football]] and immediately click out to [[American football]], say; and how long the delay is.","user":"Jnestorius"},{"date":"2009-06-14T18:08:00Z","id":693,"parent_id":692,"section":"Disambig","text":"I think this proposal makes a lot of sense.

But the other groups will be confused for a short moment, and only then they will find the link to the article they're looking for (or even not find it, as this talk page shows is a real outcome for some people).

If the article was moved to [[history of football]], then it would be just as obvious from the start what it was about: so what's the problem with moving it?\n:::*The analogy with the [[guitar]] article is spurious, for two reasons. \n::::*The connect between different types of guitar is not merely historical origin, it is ongoing similarity. If you can play one type of guitar, you can play most types, and it's not unusual for people to play many different types. Have a look through the articles in [[:Category:Guitarists]] and see how many begin \"N N is a guitarist ...\" versus something like \"N N is an electric twelve-string bass guitarist ...\" Getting into what guitar(s) a person favours will be mentioned further on. Compare that with [[:Category:Footballers]] where the link will always be to the specific code the person plays, and if they play more than one each will be mentioned explicitly rather than using the umbrella term \"football\".\n::::*Relatedly, there is a huge current commonality between all guitars. The [[guitar]] article has \"history\" and \"types\" sections analogous to those of the [[football]] article; but it also has further sections on construction and components, tuning, and accessories; i.e. the things all guitars have in common. The [[football]] article has no such common features section, because the only common features are those mentioned in the first sentence. Also, the [[guitar#History]] section is just a summary of a separate [[History of the classical guitar]] article.\n::::[[User:Jnestorius|jnestorius]]([[User talk:Jnestorius|talk]])\n\n:::This article could be the basis of any disambiguation page [[List of types of football]].","user":"GordyB"},{"date":"2009-06-17T10:13:00Z","id":696,"parent_id":693,"section":"Disambig","text":"I agree that right now the naming of this article is a disservice to our readers.

There have almost always been a hodgepodge of sports of varying types called \"football\".  Some looked more like association football, some looked more like rugby, some looked a bit like both, and some looked like neither.  While the [[Cambridge rules]] date to 1848, Rugby's first written rules were drawn up in 1845, see [[History of rugby union]].  Both games were being played in parallel, and there is ample evidence that both were called \"football\", often unqualified, in their early years.  In America, games called football have been played for a long time.  Some, like [[Old division football]], more soccer-like date from the 1820's.  Others, such as the so called \"Boston game\", which was more rugby-like, date to the 1860's.  Its just not feasible, or correct, to say the oldest use of the term \"football\" refers unambiguously to association football.  In some places, and at some times, it means association football.

If I was mistaken in that view (which I will determine through my own research), then so be it. My first statement was essentially support for what I'm assuming is the status quo (it not really being clear above), based on an assupmtion that it probably used the name \"football\" longer in England then any other code, and that it worth leaving it at the status quo, rather than trying to disrupt a current practice in WP association football articles. Obviously, as that view is not acceptable to some vocal rugby proponents, I see no reason to stick my neck out. That was the reason for adopting a stricter view, not because of Jayron's \"history lesson\" per se. I can live with either the status quo (mention specific code of football for all codes ecept for association football articles that don't already use \"soccer\", or the consistent in all articles view.

Yes, you can find references to games called football dating to the 17th century, or maybe even earlier.  However, the games that this word refer to was not necessarily soccer.  In fact, it likely wasn't, since soccer (association football) didn't really exist till much later.  There were games where people kicked the ball only which were called football.  There were games where people carried the ball and ran with it that were called football.  There were games where you could catch the ball, but not run with it, that were called football.  Sometimes handuse was allowed, sometimes not.  There were different rules regarding deciding a winner; regarding scoring; regarding the number of players or the goal of the game.  And all of these hundreds of different, unique games were all called football.  The name football, to identify a game, predates the existance of any of the modern codes of football, be they Gaelic, Australian, Association, Rugby, American, or Canadian.

Now clearly there is no objective point at which a person or institution's level of fame or notability reaches a certain level at which we can presume no disambiguation is required; this is why I'd consider the hatnote as appropriate where: a. the article introduction does not provide sufficient terminology or imagery to identify the code played; or b., more than one version of ENGVAR can apply to the article AND the the subject of article is not regularly represented as a player of their code. By that definition, Beckham's regular appearances as a footballer in news, popular culture etc would mean that no disambig is required (I'd say the same for [[Roy Keane]]). [[David O'Leary]], on the other hand, would probably need it, not least because the article is much less explicit as to which code is discussed. \n\nAs for point two, I'm not sure.

But is there consensus on whether there is a problem at all that needs to be solved? I think there is a small problem. For example: the current DYK-article [[1887 Michigan Wolverines football team]] seriously had me puzzled for a while. The hook says that they taught their opponents \"how to play the game of football\". It did not say which kind of football, so I went to the article. It did not explicitly say it. I know Michigan is a US town, so I expected it to be American Football, but the image in the infobox does not show the familiar protection used in that sport. My guess was that in 1887 they played American Football without protection, but it could as well be rugby that they are playing. I had to follow three links before I could confirm it was American Football that they played. Other readers could run into similar problems.\n:These problems would be solved if every article on football had a hatnote indicating which kind of football is meant, but as written above, this is not an acceptable solution. In most articles, people will know the context, and then it is not needed. Action is only needed when readers come to an article without knowing the context. Is is therefore perhaps an idea to require DYK, FA's and GA's to show which kind of football is used (not as a rule, but as a guideline)?\n:To me, showing which kind of football does not have to be directly with a hatnote or in the prose. [[Manchester United F.C.]] says they play in the Premier League and won the UEFA champions league, both of which are clearly \"association football\" as can be read in their article. For [[Strathmore Football Club]], if it wasn't for the explicit mention in the first sentence, you'd have to follow at least two links before you know which type of football they play. I know that \"how many links you need to follow before you find out\" is not a good basis for a rule, because there might be people reading a paper version. I just put it here because somebody might improve this thought into something that does work. --[[User:EdgeNavidad|EdgeNavidad]] ([[User talk:EdgeNavidad|Talk]] ·","user":"EdgeNavidad"},{"date":"2010-11-25T09:33:00Z","id":1015,"parent_id":1011,"section":"Consensus: Per [[WP:ENGVAR]] all codes can use football without explanation","text":"Hi Edge - yes, I think it should be clear from any article what version of football is being discussed.

The section that mentions Caid does not make any claim regarding influence on \"local code\"; the only thing close to this that I was able to find were the final two sentences in the Gaelic football section: \"Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\". All of which is [[WP:SYNTH]] and (yep) unsourced; so I'd advise against using it as the basis for specific introductory statements. There also seems to be some contradiction: if all contemporary football codes developed from those of 18th/19th century English public schools, how does Caid, as  \"[an]other regional form of football\" fit in in terms of influencing local Irish codes? What were these local codes, how did they develop, and what happened to them, if all contemporary forms of football, including Gaelic football, developed from the 18th/19th public school game?   \n::* \"The influence and power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread\".

Modern humans grew out of [[Australopithecine]]s, though modern humans look distinctly different.  If \"grew out of\" is a problem, perhaps a term like \"evolved\" may imply more changes between the McGill-Harvard contest and the modern forms of American football.  But there is a direct and undisputed line between the McGill-Harvard games --> \"Concessionary Rules\" games between Yale & Harvard --> [[Walter Camp]] from Yale.  Check the sources I provided above.  That the game changed from the first McGill-Harvard games over the next few decades doesn't diminish the fact that the game was crucial in later devlopments.  Before its influence, the predominant form of football played in America was association football, or something darn close to it.  That was the game that all of the schools except Harvard preferred.  It left Harvard without anyone to play, which is why the scheduled the rugby match with McGill.  Most of the other schools playing football at the time were playing some variation of \"kick a round ball in the goal\" type games; the introduction of the \"run the oblong ball across the line\" game to the United States came directly from the McGill-Harvard contest.  It is quite correct to state that modern American football evolved in a direct line from the McGill-Harvard game.

That's an easy windmill to tilt, but it's not what I wrote.  Again, please reread my third paragraph above.  You differ from both your source and [http://www.steelersuk.com/history/early%20football.html mine] by seeming to argue that a single event or a single game somehow demarcates the line between early and modern football.  (Although I'm not quite sure that that's what you're arguing, you don't directly address my concerns and don't seem to be arguing against what I wrote).  I just reread the article that you cite, and I would argue that it supports my position more than it does your's.  It states that, \"Some historians have gone so far as to call the Oneidas' victories the first games of American football, maintaining the hybrid Boston Game was neither soccer nor rugby and, therefore, was what Americans recognize as their favorite autumn sport.\"  The Oneidas were youngsters in Boston who played this game prior to Harvard/ McGill game.  It goes on to mention that Harvard's game, prior to McGill's \"invention\" of modern American football, was as follows:  \"The emphasis seems to have been on kicking, but the ball could be caught and run if the catcher was pursued.\"  Obviously my earlier statement that \"the McGill players introduced carrying the ball to the Harvard players\" is incorrect. It seems that the McGill's rugby game simply introduced rule and scoring innovations to the Harvard game.  It was a step along the evolutionary ladder, but so was kicking a ball with your foot, and so was the line of scrimmage and the forward pass.  It seems pretty arbitrary to claim that this event was what modern American football \"grew out of.\"\n\nAnd SPEAKING of the evolutionary ladder, your example of Australopithecines relates to exactly the point I'm trying to make.  Australopithecus is one of our ancestors, but they didn't magically appear whole cloth, and there were species between them and us.  Australopithecus was an innovation on the way to modern humans, but it is both a [[Ardipithecus|descendant]] and an [[Homo heidelbergensis|ancestor]] of other equally important species.  It doesn't hold a privileged position in the evolutionary trajectory of our species.  Humans no more \"grew out of\" or \"evolved\" from them than we did from earlier or more recent examples of humans.  No one would mistake a bunch of Australopithecines for modern humans, even if they were running around with a ball and were playing something that vaguely resembled modern rugby.  (Also, and I just have to add this, if the Australopithecines were playing by the rules played in the Harvard/ McGill game, there wouldn't be a line of scrimmage or a forward pass).  Case Western Reserve University doesn't take credit for discovering [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|fossils of \"modern\" humans]], but McGill is making an analogous claim.  Modern American football is the result of many innovations in many different times and places, and by oversimplifying that, we loose a lot of the richness of its history. --","user":"Antigrandiose"},{"date":"2013-01-02T15:25:00Z","id":1097,"parent_id":0,"section":"Australian rules","text":"I think that Australian rules football should be stated by it's full name in the article.

The sources such as Zhanguoce (战国策）clearly indicate that already during the period of Warring States playing Cuju or Taju, a leather ball filled with feathers, was a common pass-time for people of Qi, one of the seven major kingdoms striving for supremacy at that time. A later source, \"别录\" (Other Records) makes a reference to a lost text where the invention of Cuju is attributed to Huangdi, the forefather of Chinese civilization. Naturally, it could be as well a legend, nevertheless, it must be noted that a common use of football in China definitely predates the Han Dynasty (contrary to what the article states) as the period of Warring States predates Han. Han Dynasty comes after the collapse of Qin Shi Huang, and the emergence of Qin as a supreme political and military power which unifies all conflicted kingdoms practically ends the era of the Warring States.","user":"Krakauer22"},{"date":"2017-08-11T19:45:00Z","id":1146,"parent_id":1145,"section":"Semi-protected edit request on 11 August 2017","text":"[[File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] Not done: please provide [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable sources]] that support the change you want to be made.
