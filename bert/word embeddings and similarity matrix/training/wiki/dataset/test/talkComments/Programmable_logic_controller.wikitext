== Pneumatic and mechanical PLC's ==
A few years back, when I attended school, I learned about PLC's. I was shown three industrial PLC’s: one electronic (as on the wiki), one pneumatic and one mechanical. All three had the same functionality and could handle both digital and analogue I/O signals (by voltage, pressure and force). They are terribly obsolete today, but they are in my opinion very interesting and worth mentioning. Unfortunally I know very little about the pneumatic and mechanical PLC’s, perhaps someone does and whishes to add it?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/87.208.51.83|87.208.51.83]] ([[User talk:87.208.51.83|talk]]) 22:21, 15 February 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Programming PLC ==

There is some info missing: PLC can be programmed not only in ladder languages or C, but there is a galore of possibilities:
<ul>
<li>ladder logic (mentioned),</li>
<li>structural languages - mostly C (mentioned),</li>
<li>low-level languages- assembler, basic,</li>
<li>block languages, like FBD, PD, FUP...,</li>
<li>sequential function charts.</li>
</ul>
However, I don't feel wise enough to write more :D

There seems to be quite a few inaccuacies with this article.  For one, complex programs need not always be done by a ELECTRICAL Engineer (It states Industrial Engineer).  There are many highly skilled PLC programmers who are not Electrical Engineers. [[User:ProdigalSon|ProdigalSon]]

Also the IEC-1138 standard is not relevant to the topic, the actual one is IEC-61131-3; but there is no "structured C" there at all.

== History ==
There seems to be some confusion about the history of the PLC.  The present article seems to indicate that GM was the driving force behind the development of the PLC. However, in this article - http://www.barn.org/FILES/historyofplc.html, Dick Morley, its inventor, seemed to have had in mind the machine tool industry when he first envisioned it. Can anyone clarify this issue?  Which came first - GM's proposal for a PLC or the PLC itself that neatly fit into GM's needs?

Also: The term PC for 'Programmable Controller' was used until ~1981 with the introduction of the IBM PC. 'PC' then became 'PLC' to differentiate from the ubiquitous Personal Computer...

Also: the article says; "PLC and Programmable Logic Controller are registered trademarks of the Allen-Bradley Company". How can this be? [[User:193.202.109.254|193.202.109.254]] 14:38, 25 October 2007 (UTC)
:: The article no longer claims this, which I think is a serious omission, but I'll leave it to AB to police their IP.  I don't know about "Programmable Logic Controller" but "PLC" is clearly labeled as an AB trademark in all their literature.  I took care to avoid using that term in my own software ladder logic implementation, back in the 80's.  [[User:Learjeff|Learjeff]] ([[User talk:Learjeff|talk]]) 20:06, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

: Also, the article claims automobile production lines used drum sequencers (?) that sounds like bull shit to me.

:: No, it's true. However [[drum sequencer]] in this context means a thing like a [[cam timer]] with a rotating drum, not an 808 or a 303. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 07:39, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

AB has a patent on the "Programmable Logic Controller", abbreviated PLC. http://www.plcdev.com/allen_bradley_plc_patent_3942158_by_dummermuth

== Simple and representative ==

We don't need to document all methodologies used for each brand of PLC.  We all have our favorite system and after a while it seems like the One True Way.  I programmed ZWorld controllers in C(more or less) to control gas flows.  If you controlled cutting machines using GE Fanucs, everything has a slightly different feel.  We don't need to document the different feels in this page.  For example, I just whittled down a big mess regarding the labels we use for digital input values:  On/Off, 1/0, T/F, 24VDC/0VDC.  Any of these is valid.  Including them all just confuses the un-initated reader.  You control motors, I control valves but we don't need to list everything that is a digital output to communicate the idea of Digital Output.  Same with programming languages, UIs, data storage, networking... Can we keep it simple and representative please? -- [[User:TomCerul|TomCerul]] 05:38, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

== Examples ==

Okay folks, we know PLC programming is full of millions of details regarding how things can go horribly wrong.  What examples should we use? My choice has been 
:1. DI/DO
:2. AI/AO
:3. Should we add an HMI example?
:4. And now I'm thinking we should add an example and section describing the level of the complexity inherent to industrial control/PLC programming. Perhaps:"Now change the controlled fluid to gasoline.  Extensive safety precations must be implemented. Overfill, vapor detection, catch pan liquid detector, exhaust monitoring, controller air pressure monitoring..."
I want to make most of the article clear enough for a layman.
[[User:TomCerul|TomCerul]] 15:41, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

Since PLCs are never installed without a lot of accompanying electrical interfacing, some pictures of typical electrical control cabinets would help give PLC installations some context.

In the water level controller sample program shown in the page high level and low level float switches are open (input low) when water is above them and vice versa. That means for the fill valve to be latched open both inputs should be high. But this sample program shows both input should be low for the valve to be latched. Can anyone check?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.100.16.35|78.100.16.35]] ([[User talk:78.100.16.35|talk]]) 10:10, 12 December 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

"PLC" from its original inception stood for "Process Local Controller" - somewhere along the line this has been changed by common usage to "Programmable Logic Controller" [[Special:Contributions/81.151.17.6|81.151.17.6]] ([[User talk:81.151.17.6|talk]]) 11:13, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
: Got a reference?  I've never heard of that story and the first time I got my mitts on a PLC was in 1980. Of course, credentials mean nothing on the Wikipedia. All the old Allen-Bradley literature that I had access to, called it "Programmable logic controller" and some of that went back to the mid '70s- pretty early on in the scheme of these things. As a check on my sanity, Google returns exactly 5 hits on the exact phrase "process local controller" and none of them are in an industrial automation context.  "Process control" usually meant analog loops in the old days, and PLCs weren't even usable for analog quantities for many years. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 15:16, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

After reading the external article, I have the impression that it is an advertisement for a particular brand of PLC (Omron) and not simply a generic tutorial on the operation of PLCs.

The page that would be linked in this case consists of two frames. The left one shows Google ads and the right one shows a page from a different domain (a chapter from a book, not even the table of contents). Thus it does seem pointless to link to the page that simply adds advertisements to another one, when we can link to the one without those advertisements instead ([[Wikipedia:External links#Links normally to be avoided]] includes "''5. [...] or to web pages with objectionable amounts of advertising. [...]''").

That leaves another question: should the page with the book (Nebojsa Matic "Introduction to PLC controllers") - http://www.mikroe.com/en/books/plcbook/plcbook.htm - be linked? As noted by [[User:Athabaska-Clearwater|Athabaska-Clearwater]], it might still have some disadvantages...

However the example as written states that the switches are closed(ie on) when the level is low, so the program will find two false conditions (since it is looking for off) and the valve will not open.

:::::::: Still not following, but it sounds like both the root of the problem and the freedom for the proposed solution is the ambiguity of the [/] and [] contact symbols for float switches since float switches do not have an unambiguous "normal" state.  But the diagram does follow the somewhat normal convention where the lower liquid level condition is called the "normal" state.  But this application (being "pump in" rather than "pump out")  is the reverse of the normal float switch application, making the "normal" state not so "normal".   Long story short, I don't agree that there is an error, but have no objection to changing those two symbols as you propose.  <font color ="#0000cc">''North8000''</font> ([[User talk:North8000#top|talk]]) 22:16, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
{{outdent}} There is a perfectly unambiguous convention for switches; the position on the diagram is the "on the shelf", non-operated, position (ANSI Y32.2 clause 4.3).

:That convention would dictate showing the float switches as normally closed (as they currently are).  The fact that that "normal" position is "abnormal" for this particular application I think caused some confusion for the individual who wrote, but I think that that convention is a good idea and also follows the most common practice.  <font color ="#0000cc">''North8000''</font> ([[User talk:North8000#top|talk]]) 14:52, 23 October 2012 (UTC)
::Ok, to clarify (I am the one that raised the question). My confusion, it seems to me, arises from the possibility that although the diagram appears like a fragment of ladder code, it is maybe a kind of quasi wiring diagram, hence your concern with adhering to conventions re the representation of different types of switches. As a piece of ladder code, it would not behave correctly, for the reason that I have already outlined. This confusion is understandable since we are talking about PLCs, most of which are coded using ladder logic. If it is intended to be a ladder code fragment it needs the change I suggested, if not it needs to be clearer exactly what the diagram's purpose is.

:::I think that I understand now.   It is not clear whether the float switch symbols on the diagram represent the real world devices or symbols in a software program.

:::: We probably need to explain that the symbols on the ladder diagram are operating on holding register bits in the PLC memory, not the actual contact status of the field device. You need to know what "power on the PLC input" means to the process - does it signify "level above the float switch/button held down/limit switch operated" or the reverse?  Since this is a fruitful source of bugs in new PLC programs, the point probably wants some expansion. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 13:44, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

In the water level controller sample program shown in the page high level and low level float switches are open (input low) when water is above them and vice versa. That means for the fill valve to be latched open both inputs should be high. But this sample program shows both input should be low for the valve to be latched. Can anyone check?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.100.32.30|78.100.32.30]] ([[User talk:78.100.32.30|talk]]) 10:38, 12 December 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:We are using some terms  and symbols that are inherently ambiguous or confusing in the case at hand.   Namely "normally"  and the meanings of representations in the PLC of "normally" open and "normally" closed contacts.   We are  also using an example (pump to full) which is the reverse of the more common pump application which is "pump to empty".  IMHO your post was correct until it said "But this sample program shows both input should be low for the valve to be latched." which is not the case.  We should probably change the example to one where the real word devices have a clear and intuitive "normal" state (e.g devices that spring to that position, are in that position when the system in the application is at rest), and where they are and are represented as normally open contacts.  I think that that would solve the eternal confusion with this example.  <b><font color ="#0000cc">''North8000''</font></b> ([[User talk:North8000#top|talk]]) 12:19, 12 December 2013 (UTC)

I dont really see PLC caring about whether a contact is physically NO or NC, or if it is pump to full or pump to empty, or spring to position or anything like that. In the description section it is said "In ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a "normally open" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic "true" signal on to the next element of the ladder." So if the input contacts are physically closed the corresponding input address is high, and have a 1 bit in the internal memory, which happens when the tank is empty as per the description. So that should have been the condition for latching the valve, right?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/176.203.50.177|176.203.50.177]] ([[User talk:176.203.50.177|talk]]) 15:06, 12 December 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:My thoughts were about how to make a simpler/ clearer example, not about this example.  The best place to start the conversation in the areas that you are discussing is the physical system without PLC terminology and contact terminology.  There are two switches at different heights. (the names of the switches are "low level" and "high level") the contact on each is closed when the level is below the level setpoint of the switch. And of course, the physical reality is that when the low one is closed, the high one is "already" closed, and when the high one is open, the low one is "already" open). And let's start  the description when it at its highest state when both switches are open.  Then: 
:#The liquid  starts getting used and the level starts dropping 
:#The liquid drops below the level of the "high" level switch.  The switch closes, but nothing else happens 
:#The liquid continues to drop 
:#The liquid drops to the setpoint of the "low level" switch 
:#The low level switch closes 
:#The control system turns on the pump, and closes a control system contact which is in parallel with the low level switch. This is called "latching" because it goes into a state where the low level switch closure is no longer needed to keep the pump on, i.e. it is unable to "break" the circuit because it has been "bypassed" by the control system contact which is in paralell with it.   
:#The pump raises the level of the liquid. 
:#The "low level" switch opens, but such has no effect and so the pump continues to raise the level of the liquid 
:#The level rises through the setpoint of the "high level switch".  This "breaks" the circuit and shuts the pump off and the control system also opens the latching contact. 
:So there's a description of the physical reality of the system and what the control system needs to do. Next is the more confusing part, which is how to represent the physical and software implementation using a PLC.

I guess you are putting across the actual physical logic for a layman (when the water level is low both switches are "Normally Closed" which condition should energize the fill valve) with no introduction to the ladder logic programming. In that case I guess this is a good idea, but still I think it is better to clarify this in the article page not to confuse those who know a little ladder logic programming.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/176.203.50.177|176.203.50.177]] ([[User talk:176.203.50.177|talk]]) 17:09, 12 December 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== PLC vs. What you can use a PLC at ==

This article is focused on PLC usage rather than explaining what a PLC really is, or moreover, what a PLC is made of.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.125.236.87|86.125.236.87]] ([[User talk:86.125.236.87|talk]]) 21:49, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:It's certainly not perfect, but I think it is focused on providing the common useful information.  A PLC is made of nearly all of the parts used to build any type of electronic equipment (resistors, capacitors, printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, transistors, diodes etc.) plus sometimes a few that are electromechanical equipment. IMHO the former is not very unique/informative regarding PLC's.   <font color ="#0000cc">''North8000''</font> ([[User talk:North8000#top|talk]]) 03:03, 1 May 2012 (UTC)

== PLC vs PAC? ==

In the See Also section there is a link called "[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PLC_vs_PAC.jpg PLC vs PAC comparison chart at commons.wikimedia.org]". This is confusing for two reasons:
1. Nowhere else in the article the acronym PAC is mentioned, let alone explained or spelled out.
2. The chart itself contradicts the article. For example it claims that programming is only possible via ladder logic while the article gives four more possibilities (under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller#Programming_2 ).

== Hard real time only ? ==

I'm afraid that there is a problem with the phrase
:A PLC is an example of a "hard" real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.

As far as i understand, a PLC could be used in a soft real time system, meaning a system where not meeting a deadline won't cause a total system failure, only a (possible) degrading of the system service quality.

Of course, due to its cost, a PLC is more useful in a hard real time system, but as far as i can see, there's nothing that would prohibit their use in systems with other real time requirements.

==Large amount of April 11th, 2017 additions==

I think that there are numerous problems with the April 11th additions but I was hesitant to revert en-masse. It noted a problem with a particular vendor, and the complaint looks implausible.  The descriptions of timers look confusing and missing important pieces at best, and in conflict with standard timers at worst, and it appears that the terminology may be specific to one vendor. The counter section seems to base itself on vendor-specific terminology. In the up/down counter area it conflicts with the common "up/down" (bi-directional) counter-specialized input on PLC's which utilizes a quadrature input, not separate "up" and "down" inputs.

The edit comment on the revert was "Confusing and possibly misleading. They Allen Bradley became prominent and leading in PLC's when it was not Rockwell." I have reverted that revert. What the ref says about Rockwell is, "Also involved was Odo Struger of Allen-Bradley, now Rockwell Automation. Rockwell became the PLC leader in the US through good marketing and development of strong distribution channels...". I think my version is more true to the ref. The original version has the problematic "Rockwell (Allen-Bradley)" phrase and also I think it is further from what North8000 claims happened than my version.
