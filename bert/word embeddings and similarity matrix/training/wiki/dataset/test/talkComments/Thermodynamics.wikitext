== undoing a good-faith edit; why ==

Editor [[User:K Sikdar|K Sikdar]] is new. He has put his citation in his edit summary. The citation should go in the text so that a reader can check it. The citation should give the page location in the source. It is best to give especially reliable and established sources in a topic such as the present one, for which the potential sources are legion. Engineering texts are reliable within their scope, but the present topic is not in the same scope as engineering.

As for the content of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&type=revision&diff=710685573&oldid=710596084 his edit]. The part of the article where he placed his edit is structured as an ultra-brief summary, not an expression in detail. The edit inserts inappropriate detail.

It is far from evident that the "Kelvin-Planck" statements are to be preferred, even if it were granted that such detail were appropriate at that point in the presentation in the article.

The edit is not wrong, but doesn't fit where it is placed, and consequently does not improve the article.

For these reasons I am about to undo the edit.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 20:57, 18 March 2016 (UTC)

With all due respect, what Kelvin, Planck and Clausius have said about the second law is definitely more important than your opinion about whether their statements should be included or not.

I think in many ways the older versions are superior to the current article - for instance https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&oldid=417201632 .  It's more concise, and I think the language is much clearer in most places (however it may be missing some important elements that were added later).  I'm considering reverting to that old version (or a similar one) and then adding back anything that seems notable enough, but I'm asking for comments here first since it would be a major change. <small>'''<span style="color:Olive">Waleswatcher</span>''' [[User_talk:Waleswatcher#top|''(<span style="color:green">talk</span>)'']]</small> 15:28, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

I agree, it's not very appropriate to dwell on the subject "as a college class."  The article should be about thermodynamics. [[User:Edsanville|Ed Sanville]] 06:50, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

Why did user CDC revert my edits to this page (as 129.170.x.x)?  I am attempting to transform the page into a more logically coherent sequential exposition of the basics of thermodynamics and its relationship to statistical mechanics, and I can't for the life of me figure out why my edits were reverted.

Rephrased second law.  I am very wary about making statements 
that involve the entire universe.  

-----
------
I refrained from editing for 2 reasons:
1.  The article is very pretty, articulate, concise, etc. and the author appeared to know his subject.
2.  I did not have my CRC or thermo book handy to refer to

but ....  I think the definition of a <b>closed system</b> is incorrect.   IIRC Several definitions can be quibbled:  1.  Nothing crosses the control surface of a closed system that is unaccounted for the purposes of analysis.  2.  Nothing crosses the control surface of a closed system.

In the real universe there is no such thing as a closed system, except possibly the universe by definition. This is a concept used to approximate things so closely that the error does not matter and meaningful analysis by tracking the flows (fluxes) accross the system boundary is feasible.

Perhaps the phrase <b>closed system</b> is being confused with <b>closed loop system</b>.  In a closed loop system typically no mass (close enough to zero for practical analysis) would cross the boundary.   In an open loop system there is mass flow out of the "system" defined as open loop.

Anyway, I will come back to this ... an excellent article if we can fix the small bugs and merge the previous content to meet the wiki way requirement  8)  [[user:mirwin]]

p.s.  Perhaps it was I who was confused.  My fluid flow book defines a system as ...paraphrasing slightly    ... The three basic physical laws previously listed  (conservation of mass, Newtons second law, and first law of thermodynamics) are all stated in terms of a <b>system</b>.

<b>"A system is defined as a collection of matter of fixed identity."</b>

Goes on to point out that in fluid flow we use a <b>control volume</b> for analysis precisely to avoid having to define a system because this is very difficult (impossible?) for dynamically flowing fluids.

However I clearly remember a debate in college over a religious book attempting to misdefine technical terms to prove that scientific theories were internally inconsistent.

In this debate the book's claim was that a seed or Earth were closed systems and got more organized .... violating entropy.   My position that Earth or seed was not a closed system because sunlight was entering and heat was leaving thus satisfying entropy increase requirement of thermo laws was upheld by the chemistry professor.

I think the term <b> closed system</b> must be carefully defined relative to the system analysis in progress.  Since thermo deals with heat and energy flows I do not think it makes sense to call a closed system one in which mass is fixed but heat flows are occurring.  

OTOH The definition in bold above is fairly precise that system related to mass only.  Perhaps the equilibrium requirements in the thermo laws allows useful application of this definition.  At equilibrium there is no heat flow.
So my professor was agreeing that earth was not a closed system because it is not in equilibrium with surroundings.
If it was a fixed set of mass in thermal equilibrium then it would be a closed system?

The definition quoted above is from fluid flow section of "Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat, and Mass Transfer" text by Welty, Wicks, and Wilson so it is understandable they may have neglected other domains when defining system.

Comments anyone?  My career experience has been primarily project and business management so correcting me on pesky details in concepts studied twenty years ago is not threatening emotionally.  8) [[user:mirwin]]
----------

Ok I am back.   The 1rst law and/or the definition of a closed system needs some serious correction.

Proof:   Define a closed system as a black hole.  There is sufficient mass that its gravity bends space time enough that not even light can get back out except under special conditions.    By our current definition of fixed mass this is a <b>closed system</b>.   Light (energy) falls into it but does not come back out.  This is a violation of our first law as it is current written .... or at least my understanding of it as written.

Perhaps inclusion of relativistic gravity field potentials would satisfy our 1rst law as stated but I think we have an error in this <b>closed system</b> definition or concept.
Thermodynamics was successfully formulated prior to relativity and not invalidated by it as far as I know.

My text (ref above) says  "The first law of thermodynamics may be stated as follows:  <b>If a system is carried through a cycle, the total heat added to the system from its surroundings is proportional to the work done by the system on it surroundings.</b>   Note that this law is written for a specific group of particles - those comprising the defined system."

This is a gas in a controlled volume absorbing or releasing heat and doing work on itself and/or the surroundings by expanding or contracting.  

<b>delta Heat - delta Work = delta total Energy</b>

Note the use of the term <b>defined system</b> or system NOT <b>"closed system"</b>


IIRC In an adiabatic (zero heat flow - system closed with respect to heat) expansion gas is held under pressure in a fixed, insulated control volume initially then allowed to push a weighted cylinder upward.  The system is the gas particles.

Using the above delta heat =0 (Insulated) giving
- delta work = delta energy  Since work is exerted on the surroundings delta work is positive .... so the delta energy is negative ..... the temperature of the gas drops by a quantity necessary to balance the work performed by the system.

This is verified empirically as what really happens.

So if we consider our <b>closed system</b> to be the 
and gas inside the cylinder container is the above consistent with our local article 1rst law as currently stated ..... 

<b>In a closed system energy in is equal to energy out.</b>
Heat and work are both energy.

I am not sure .... probably need more precise definitions.
Works if closed system means fixed mass and zero heat flows (adiabatic) across the control surface (boundary of gas)

Bringing me full circle .... I think <b>closed system</b> is currently defined poorly.

Sorry to be so yakky but this is very important and fundamental.  Errors here could turn off a lot of useful knowledgeable practicing engineers.   I know a few I would like to introduce to the site ... but not before it is ready to impress them a bit as potentially useful and worth contributing to.  [[user:mirwin]]

I don't like the version of the third law given here. I just did a search on the Internet, and it looks like it's fairly popular, but I have no idea why. The first thing someone's going to say when they see it is "who cares about perfect crystals". What about
:All processes cease as temperature approaches zero
or
:Absolute zero can only be approached asymptotically
I also don't like the ones that say S(T=0)=0, because in the usual derivation of the third law, S(T=0) is a constant, which is set to zero merely for convenience. It's similar to the way you can set gravitational potential energy at r -> &infin; to zero.

If no-one answers, I'll just change it. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim]]

Okay, no-one answered. It's changed. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]]

"If A and B are at the same temperature, and B and C are at the same temperature, then A and C are also at the same temperature."

Actually, I'm under the strong impression that the zeroth law is:
"If A and B are in thermal equilibrium, and B and C are in thermal equilibrium, then A and C are also in thermal equilibrium."

The way it is written down now, the zeroth law becomes a trivial fact. Since '=' is an equivalence relation, 'having the same temperature' is necessarily transitive. If no-one disagrees, I'll change the definition shortly. (More information can be found in [[Status_of_the_zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics]].) --[[User:Victor Gijsbers|Victor Gijsbers]]

::Ok, thanks for the tip. --[[User:Victor Gijsbers|Victor Gijsbers]]

Current statement of the third law: "All processes cease as temperature approaches zero."

This is not only wrong, it is positively meaningless in the context of thermodynamics. In this theory, temperature is defined for equilibrium states only (the theory only talks about equilibrium states), so no processes take place whenever a temperature is defined, not just at absolute zero. Something along these lines could perhaps be the 3rd law of statistical mechanics, but it cannot be a law od thermodynamics.

I suggest replacing it by Buchdahl's (1966, The concepts of classical thermodynamics) formulation: ''The entropy of any given system attains the same finite least value for every state of least energy.'' --[[User:Victor Gijsbers|Victor Gijsbers]]

How about, ''The entropy of a system reaches some finite minimal value for every state of minimal energy.'' [[User:Pizza Puzzle|Pizza Puzzle]]

----
You say that the idea of a change or process taking place is absolutely meaningless. This is incorrect, indeed the bulk of any undergraduate level thermodynamics course deals with precisely such processes. This is done formally by defining a process as being a succession of infintesimally separated equilibrium states. This is called a "quasistatic" process. There is no time variable as such, instead relationships between various thermodynamic properties are calculated. I'm taking this from Chapter 1 of Sears & Salinger, by the way.

The statement of the 3rd law I was paraphrasing (again from S&S) is:

:''It is impossible to reduce the temperature of a system to absolute zero in any finite number of operations''

It's true that I allude to the presence of a time variable, but I do this to maintain comprehensibility. I don't believe it significantly affects the accuracy of the statement. After all, I don't define the word "cease" -- I could easily make up a definition on the spot which fits in with the quasistatic picture.

The advantage of this statement is that a lay-person can understand it. A person not trained in thermodynamics has very little conception of it means for entropy to approach zero. "You can't cool something to absolute zero" is a statement that your Mum would understand, and it is sufficiently rigorous at the level of this article. 

An alternative statement, again saying exactly the same thing, is this:

:''The derivative of temperature with respect to any macroscopic property, with entropy held constant, is zero when temperature is zero.''

But please, save it for an article with a more advanced target audience. Specifically, save it for [[third law of thermodynamics]], where a proper explanation can be given of such complexities.

:The statement that "all processes cease as the temperature approaches zero" is not even true (and hence it cannot be a proper statement of the 3rd law).  For example, one could take a zero-temperature Fermi gas and allow it to undergo an isothermal expansion process, doing p dV work.  I am removing the erroneous statement.

Feynman's Quote.

* In fact, the science of thermodynamics began with an analysis, by the great engineer Sadi Carnot, of the problem of how to build the best and most efficient engine, and '''this constitutes one of the few famous cases in which engineering has contributed to fundamental physical theory.''' Another example that comes to mind is the more recent analysis of information theory by Claude shannon. '''these two analyses, incidentally, turn out to be closely related.'''
     
in The Laws of Thermodynamics,The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

I think we should include this quote somewhere in the related articles.--[[User:Sahodaran|Sahodaran]] 02:33, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== 1st Law ==

"The sum of heat flowing into a system and work done by the system is zero. " - No, non-zero heat may flow into a system (e.g. a metal bar) but the system do no work. It might just get hot.

Perhaps the more standard "The heat flowing into a system is equal to the change in internal energy minus the work done by the system." would be better.

"The work exchanged in an adiabatic process depends only on the initial and the final state and not on the details of the process. " - What is "work exchanged"? You obviously have a context in mind here but it is not spelt out. Anyway, work is "done", not exchanged.

:Quite so. Those alternate statements were added by Reddi, I didn't really pay much attention to their accuracy.

::: The way I remember this stuff, just like the zeroth law is a statement about the existence of a transitive '''thermodynnamic equilibrium''' and can be used to ''define'' '''temperature''', the first law (as it is stated) requires an explanation of what is meant by heat transfer (or absence thereof: '''adiabatic''') and can be used to ''define'' '''work'''. I need to research the details so I can add it to the article. &mdash; [[User:Miguel|Miguel]] 03:15, 2004 Feb 26 (UTC) 

Without context information, it's not clear (to me) that the "entropy" version is really the same as the 1st law. I think that you need to clarify this statement.

We have: "The entropy of a closed macroscopic system never decreases". Shouldn't this say "isolated" since we are giving the system theoretic definition: "closed systems: exchanging energy (heat and work) but not matter with their environment". I have changed this to "thermally isolated" as in the [[Entropy]] article. Physics texts usually define "closed" to mean "thermally isolated". I came here because of a discussion with someone who was using the statements in this article to argue that the Earth is essentially a closed system so it's entropy must increase.

:Whether the Earth is a closed system depends on the level of approximation. The Earth's atmosphere loses hydrogen and gains small amounts of matter from solar wind, the interstellar medium and meteorites. It also exchanges work on other celestial bodies (notably through lunar and solar tides). Finally, the Earth clearly exchanges heat with its "environment" - it radiates energy away as a black body because it is hotter than the [[CMB]]. The energy radiated should (on average) match that absorbed from solar radiation, resulting in net entropy production. The Earth is also not in local equilibrium internally, so entropy gets constantly produced. &mdash; [[User:Miguel|Miguel]] 03:58, 2004 Oct 5 (UTC)

::The article defines 'closed system' as a system that exchanges but energy but not matter with its surroundings. This is BTW the standard definiton in textbooks for physical chemists. Using this definition the statement 'The entropy of a closed system never decreases' is clearly wrong. Any cooling lump of matter that is neither gaining or loosing material to its surroundings is clearly: A) a closed system by the definition used; B) is decreasing its entropy (by giving out heat to its surroundings). The statement should be changed to 'The entropy of an isolated system never decreases'. [[User:RistoP|RistoP]]

==Time==

[[User:Moink]] said "took out "thermodynamics is not concerned with time"... not true in my experience". It's true in my experience. In all my time studying thermodynamics and statistical physics, I don't think I saw a single ''t''. Time is mentioned obliquely -- for example it's often noted that a Carnot engine would take an infinite amount of time per stroke. But the statement you removed was, I felt, quite accurate. Can you explain? -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 06:03, Jan 13, 2004 (UTC)

::Think about the second law of thermodynamics: Entropy increases with time.  If that's not a dynamic law I don't know what is.  Almost all the thermodynamics I've ever done (I'll admit it is not my central field, [[fluid dynamics]] is) has included time in some way or another.  Here's a problem for you: A reservoir is separated into two cells with a thermally insulating membrane.  The temperature on side A is 400K, on side B is 100K.  The membrane is removed.  What is the resulting temperature as a function of space and time?  If you agree that this is indeed a thermodynamic problem, then we can say that thermodynamics is more than thermostatics.  [[User:Moink|moink]] 22:29, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:::Thermodynamics uses time qualitatively, but not quantitatively. This is the fundamental point the original author was trying to make. The question of temperature as a function of space and time is not thermodynamics. The question of entropy differences between initial and final states is thermodynamics. The term "thermostatics" reminds me of [[quasistatic equilibrium]], and interesting concept in itself. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 23:23, Jan 14, 2004 (UTC)

::::If that's the point the article is trying to make, it doesn't make it very clearly.  And I disagree that the study of flow with temperature changes is not thermodynamics.  This article states that "Thermodynamics is the study of energy, its conversions between various forms..." and if a viscous flow with temperature differences is not a study of the conversions of energy between forms, I don't know what is.

Introductory courses tend to deal only with equilibrium states, mostly because they're easier to solve for beginners, and also because solving for an equilibrium state gives you quite a bit of valuable information.  But I do think thermo, in its more advanced incarnations, does deal with how it gets there.  [[User:Moink|moink]] 22:15, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::::::::I think that something here is missing. Thermodynamics deals with systems in equilibrium state, that "moves" into another equilibrium state, through an infinite set of equilibrium states (that's why it's called quasi-static operation). The time needed to actually do that would be infinite => That's why they do not talk about time, but only diff. between parameters of the system. In statistical mechanics, you can include time because then you deal with probability for a state (etc.) that can be time dependant.

Velocity is more the domain of kinetic theory not thermodynamics.

From Sears & Salinger chapter 1-1:

:Thermodynamics is an experimental science based on a small number of principles that are generalizations made from experience. It is concerned only with ''macroscopic'' or large-scale properties of matter and it makes no hypotheses about the small-scale or ''microscopic'' structure of matter. From the principles of thermodynamics one can derive general relations between such quantities as coefficients of expansion, compressibilities, specific heat capacities, heats of transformation, and magnetic and dielectric coefficients, especially as these are affected by temperature. The principles of thermodynamics also tell us which of these relations must be determined experimentally in order to completely specify ''all'' the properties of the system... 

:Thermodynamics is complementary to kinetic theory and statistical thermodynamics. Thermodynamics provides ''relationships'' between physical properties of any system once certain measurements are made. Kinetic theory and statistical thermodynamics enable one to calculate the mangitudes of these properties for those systems whose energy states can be determined.

-- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 10:44, Jan 17, 2004 (UTC)

Phenomenological study of time-dependent phenomena such as fluid mechanics or chemical reaction kinetics is separate from kinetic theory or statistical mechanics. Just like in thermodynamics on can introduce a phenomenological "heat capacity" whose value can be calculated from first principles using statistical mechanics, one can introduce a phenomenological "heat conductivity" whose value can only be calculated using kinetic theory. See my stub on [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] for more on this. [[User:Miguel|Miguel]] 03:26, 2004 Feb 26 (UTC)

I think the issue is almost a semantical one with the occasional more generalized usage of "thermodynamics" to exclusively mean "equilibrium thermodynamics".  But both "equilibrium thermodynamics" and "nonequilibrium thermodynamics" contain the word thermodynamics, so it doesn't seem quite right to claim that time is not involved in thermodynamics.  Even introductory thermodynamics courses typically deal with things like heat transfer rates, so I don't think it's an educational level issue so much as a semantical one.  Perhaps the divide between the two can be explained more clearly without excluding time from thermodynamics.

***When I first visited this article long ago, it was just a terrible pile of random bits about each of the three laws of thermodynamics, as if the three laws, (and various random jokes/analogies), were all there is to thermo.  Given that I have and had little time to do major overhauls to articles, I instead decided to add sections on the thermodynamic parameters and potentials, which are the cornerstones of thermodynamics in practice, (and weren't even mentioned in the article at the time).  I agree that this article is one of the worst articles on a huge, broad topic, but unfortunately I'm not good enough with thermo/teaching in general to put together a good encyclopedic piece.

The drawing showing cold photons and hot photons is beautiful but misleading. Individual photons (like individual molecules in a gas) have energy, but do not have temperature. The radiation from the sun have the temperature of the surface of the sun. The steady-state temperature of the planets is determined by the condition that the influx of energy from the sun to the planet equals the outgoing radiation from the planet to the universe.  [[User:Bo Jacoby|Bo Jacoby]] 09:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

: I agree, hot and cold photons are not a good concept. The image is misleading, and not relevant to the discussion. The whole discussion of thermodynamic evolution should be in a separate article, not in the thermodynamics article. I will move it soon if nobody objects. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 10:28, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
: Very true. [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 14:17, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:: The section has been moved to [[Thermodynamic evolution]] including the above discussion on its talk page. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 04:07, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

*I agree with everyone generally; I was the one that designed the image and wrote the article out of impulse being that I think this concept is a big part of thermodynamics presently.  Every new textbook or related book that comes out lately has at least one chapter on the thermodynamics of evolution.  Regarding the diagram, I based it on one similar, but without Pluto, as found in Schneider & Sagan’s 2005 ''Into the Cool – Energy Flow, Thermodynamics, and Life.''  I will admit that when I first read the book, the idea of a “cold photon” didn’t really make a lot of sense to me, and I thought the diagram was a bit dumbed-down.  Yet, over the past couple of months the diagram has grown on me a bit even if it is not word-for-word accurate.  If someone has a better way to contrast the photons to either side of the earth, then please let me know and I will up-load a new diagram.  

*I thought of maybe using high and low frequency, but that doesn’t seem to be as visually appealing.  If we want to stick with the hot/cold idea, although technically it’s not perfect, we can define temperature as:

       '''''Temperature:''' a measure of the tendency of an object or system to spontaneously give up energy''. 
*[Source: Schroeder’s ''Thermal Physics'' [2000] (textbook)].  Thus, we can think of the region of space towards the sun as being in possession of the ability to give up energy, if it were to come into contact with another adjoined system.  And as the energy portion of the universe can be defined as predominately the four fundamental forces, that is according to Nobelist [[Martinus Veltman]] (Book: ''Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics'' (2003)], we can think of the photons towards the sun as being in possession of more energy, and hence hotter in a loose sense of the term.  More than this, no one really knows what a photon is in essence?  Of all the explanations on the [[double-slit experiment|double slits experiments]] that I have every read no one has an answer.  And no one for the past 40 years has been able to explain why light (i.e. photons) shined on ultra cold liquid helium subjected to voltage functions to increase current.  Thus, if anyone has more appropriate terminology I will be glad to amend the diagram.  Thanks:--[[User:Wavesmikey|Wavesmikey]] 04:26, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

I don't think the photons coming from the sun have a lower frequency out near Pluto.  The sun looks the same color out there, after all.  I think the flux of photons is simply lower out there.  [[User:Edsanville|Ed Sanville]] 16:20, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

Actually Ed, from the expansion of the universe, photons have lower frequency as they travel. This would be negligible from the sun the pluto, but explains why the "temperature" of the universe is falling. Temperature is exactly what should be used and is commonly used by scientists to describe photon wavelength. As blackbody radiation gives of a characteristic wavelength for each temperature, the wavelength and temperature are perfectly correllated. This is how cosmologists have stated that the universe is 2.7 K, the photons from the CMB have wavelength corresponding to 2.7 K and thus, "are" at the temperature 2.7 K. Wavesmikey is completely correct. [[Lagrangian]]

for discussion see: [[talk:thermodynamic evolution]]

As the article Thermodynamic Evolution is under consideration of being deleted (and probably will, under new research). I think we should delete references to it here. [[Lagrangian]]

== Resectioning ==

I have switched sections around, hopefully putting first things first. The only actual changes that I made was to put the different types of thermodynamics (e.g. biological) into the see also section, and I move the history to the history page. I know that we should have a small history section here, so I didn't intend that move to eject history entirely, I just don't know what the small amount should be. 

I would like to start modifying the first section or two in order to describe things from the ground up, more or less, developing the idea of system, then parameters and state, and then really define the parameters by describing thermodynamic instruments, thermometer, barometer, etc. I will wait and see if this resectioning flies first.

::I was going to move the history section tomorrow myself.  I already have the paragraph in mind that I am going to use.  It will start with Robert Boyle [1656] and how he invented the pump with which he noticed the pressure-temperature correlation.  From here a bone digester was built [1679].  From here a release valve was implemented to keep the machine from exploding.  And by watching the steam valve move rhythmically up and down the concept of piston and cylinder was conceived (Denis Papin).  Then Savery built the first engine [1698].  Finally, in 1824, the father of thermodynamics Sadi Carnot published “Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire”.  Does this sound ok to everyone? P.S. leave the potential section for me, I am going to write a short paragraph on potentials and move the rest to the potential page.

I did some more work today.  The article is getting kind of long so I shortened and merged a few sections; I would suggest doing the same with the tools section - i.e. write a little mini-tools section and then connect a link to a main [[thermodynamic tools]] page.  Also, this one paragraph:

::Thermodynamics is difficult to grasp in a linear fashion. Each concept seems to require the understanding of some other concept, which ultimately refers to the initial concept for its complete explanation. The best way to understand thermodynamics is to go through the development of its concepts and principles, without expecting to understand them thoroughly on the first pass. Then, as certain concepts become more clear, others will fall into line. Accordingly, the following article will not develop ideas in a linear fashion, with each idea explained in terms of preceeding ideas. Certain concepts will be introduced without explanation, and will best be understood only upon re-reading the article.

sounds a little soft and fluffy; it kind of sounds like were giving the reader instructions on how to read an encyclopedia?  I'd do some trimming on this one.--[[User:Wavesmikey|Wavesmikey]] 09:19, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

That's fine with me; we can always revert any changes.  Temporally, I removed the following from the intro:

In particular, the entropy of a system exchanging no heat with the outside can never decrease with [[time]]. As such, entropy allows predictions on the transformations and energy exchanges that are accessible to a given system.  Related to entropy, [[Statistical mechanics]] or [[statistical thermodynamics]] is one of the underlying theories that sustain thermodynamics; it provides a way to predict the entropy of a thermodynamic system, based on the [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of the fluctuations the system experiences over a set of [[microstate]]s

I feel that it is too much for the intro; I feel the intro should represent the typical first five chapters of a general thermodynamics text book (which I have many of).

==4th thermodynamic principle==
An interesting thing about this article is that it has evolved through a process of original collaborative research towards an astute clarification of the principles of thermodynamics in words, not simply formulas. However there still seems to be the matter of [[Talk:Thermodynamics#Time|time]] implied by the 2nd law. This has been taken up in the proposed 4th law, which I have attempted to add to the article previously. There is at least one scientist who has said that "maximum empower" is generally accepted as the 4th principle  of thermodynamics. I would therefore like to add the following in the section on laws

Well, I don't want to buy a book, but googling "emergy" was informative. Especially [http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/htodum/prosperous.htm] and [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1085052]. As far as I can tell, the concept of empower (emergy/time) was pioneered by Howard T. Odum, and is concerned with the link between energy usage and evolution. With regard to human evolution, it has something to say about energy conservation, energy usage, ecology, and energy economics. Although it appears to be a legitimate concept, I don't think it is quantitatively developed enough to be considered a "hard" science. '''Its area of inquiry is not that of thermodynamics''' and therefore does not belong in this article. I think that these ideas should perhaps go into the [[thermodynamic evolution]] article. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 11:31, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

* This thread has been informative for a number of reasons.
::*1. Perhaps most important is that this thermodynamics article needs a clear statement on what  areas of inquiry are that of thermodynamics. Where is the boundry drawn and why?
::::1.1 For example if "in essence thermodynamics studies how energy instills movement", as stated in the article, then thermodynamics includes areas of inquiry which study how energy instills movement at scales such as organisms, ecological systems and the geobiosphere. Therefore the study of how embodied energy (emergy) instills movement seems to be equally as relevant.
::*2. The article mentions that open systems, open to energy flow, are a class of thermodynamic systems. M.Tribus (1961) ''Thermostatics and Thermodynamics'', Van Nostrand, University Series in Basic Engineering, gives mathematical and instrumental statements of both closed and open systems. On page 619 (§ 16.11), Tribus cites H.T.Odum and R.C.Pinkerton (1955 'Time's speed regulator: The optimum efficiency for maximum output in physical and biological systems ', Am. Sci., 43 pp. 331-343) with respects to  'Generalized Treatment of Linear Systems Used for Power Production' and maximum power. G.Q. Chen (in press) 'Scarcity of exergy and ecological evaluation based on embodied exergy', Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, p. 16. Notes that maximum power has been proposed as the fourth principle of energetics and open system thermodynamics. How is maximum power (and apparent maximum empower corralary) not a thermodynamic area of inquiry?
::*3. For pedagogic utility, all the main entries on the first 4 laws would benefit examples of how to construct simple instruments that can, A. measure mechanical and energetic power, B. and thereby demonstrate a method by which each law can be verified by anyone - else empirical knowledge of the "laws" are confined only to specialists. [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 12:19, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

I agree with 1-thermodynamics needs to be clearly defined - and 3 the instruments need to be defined - see [[thermodynamic instruments]].

However, you have not defined emergy in a quantitative sense. Tell me how to measure the emergy of a glass of water. Something that results in a number. I can tell you how to measure the pressure, the entropy, the temperature, all the thermodynamic variables of that glass of water. I can tell you the relationships between these variables. Tell me how to measure the emergy of a glass of water. Tell me the relationships between emergy and the other thermodynamic variables. Does emergy change with temperature? If so, by exactly what amount? Until you can do this, its not part of thermodynamics. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 12:58, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

* I'm glad PAR and I agree on 1. Without the intruments anyone can say anything and concot all sorts of symbolic logic laws about the world. An abstract empower law has just the same status as an abstract zeroth, 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  law. Specifications of instruments would be of benefit to many basic science curriculums - ie. wiki entry should say, here are the instruments by which one can demonstrate the laws of thermodynamics so that any average person can understand what is involved in the definition, and what it refers to. 
::*For example zeroth law should say something like, take three glasses of water all at different temperatures, measured with a mercury (or electronic) thermometer, and connect them with each other. Take a watch (or data logger) and observe what happens to the temperatures over time - record your results at equal time intervals. What is the final temperature? How long did it take. Now try the same experiment with different starting temperatures and try predict how long it will take to reach equilibrium. How accurate was your prediction? Which thermodynamic law did you use to make your prediction?   
* In turn, I agree that I have not defined emergy in a quantitative sense. But assuming I could say how to measure the emergy efficiency of a chemical reaction, I cannot do so here because as far as I am aware, with reference to the literature, to do so would constitute '''Original Research'''!  Which is against the rules of Wikipedia. Catch 22. :)
::* I would therefore like to swing the attention away from "emergy" and back to "energy". The proposed fourth principle is a statement of the [[maximum power theorem]]. Tribus,  Chen, Odum and others consider that this has to do with  thermodynamics. Indeed load power generated through a load resistor generates a heat and therefore pressure change. So maximum power seems to qualify under the conditions given by PAR. Do you agree PAR? (by the way how do you measure the '''energy''' of a glass of water?)  [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 22:02, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

This is an encyclopedia of established knowledge, and I used to be annoyed by that, but I have come to realize that it has to be that way. Wikipedia has no editorial board, no group of appointed referees, so the published literature has to act as a ''de facto'' standard. If measuring emergy is original research on your part, then publish it in a reputable peer-reviewed journal, and then you can enter it into an article as established knowledge.

::*Agreed. That's why I have not given specifications for an emergy measuring instrument in any of the articles. [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 23:32, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

With regard to the maximum power theorem, if this has thermodynamic significance, then please write down the mathematical equation of the fourth principle in terms of established (or newly defined)  thermodynamic parameters. All of the other laws can meet this demand, and the fourth must do so as well.

::*Ok, I'll see if I can make sense of the Tribus reference noted earlier, and post a summary here (...it may take a while). [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 23:25, 4 December 2005 (UTC) 

You measure the energy of a glass of water by measuring its temperature and its amount. To a good approximation, the energy is equal to the energy at STP plus the amount times the temperature in degrees celsius. In other words:

:<math>U=U_0+NT_c\,</math>

where U is the energy, U_0 is the energy at STP, N is the amount, and Tc is the temperature in celsius. The energy at STP is the energy at zero degrees celsius, and one atmosphere of pressure. To be any more exact, the measurement process gets more complicated but it is just as precisely defined. Also the properties of water in general must be accurately measured as well, but this is a well defined process too.

::*Perhaps this is a semantic quibble, but the example measures the temperature of a glass of water with an instrument (thermometer). The energy of the glass of water is not measured, but is calculated from the temperature measurement. On this basis it appears that emergy, like  energy, does not have to be directly measured, but only calculated, in order to be thermodynamically valid. [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 23:25, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

::: No I think its a valid point. Even the thermometer is not measuring temperature, its measuring the volume of a quantity of mercury. The thermometer's scale is then an analog device to "calculate" temperature.

::I think you need a gas constant in there...the second term is in units of temperature, not energy. [[User:Edsanville|Ed Sanville]] 08:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

It can be seen that this makes some sense. If you double the temperature, you double the energy above the standard energy. If you double the amount, you double the energy above the standard energy. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 23:09, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

*Sholto, I see that you are very intense in your ambition; and there is isolated talk about a maximum power 4th law, and another similar one is maximum efficiency principle (which pulls from the ecological thermodynamics fields), and there are others (about 20 that I know of).  The point is that the fourth law is far from agreed upon.  Of course there could be some room for some of your writing somewhere in the wiki?  But the fourth law is kind of like a joke (at present); if you study thermodynamics decade by decade, i.e. by reading textbook after textbook, you'll notice that it slowly took about 100 years for the main two laws to come into existence.  I don't think the 4th law will solidify for at least another 50-100 years. Why don't you write out your main statement or paragraph below so we can all think about your plan.   P.S. I collect fourth laws, what is the main book the makes this declaration?--[[User:Wavesmikey|Wavesmikey]] 06:35, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

::*A connoisseur of fourth laws? Impressive!!  Perhaps the information revoultion, and a medium like wiki, will reduce the time of evolution for scientific laws, their clear and concise statement, and verification? Most people in the field I have been looking at seem to cite Lotka (1, 2) for the original proposal. Which was then taken up by Odum (4, 5), and most recently given by G.Q. Chen (3). I believe we can see some of the nascent origins further back in the 1600's rationalism of Leibniz, and then the energetics of Mach.  M.Tribus (7., § 16.11, p. 619)  draws conclusions and variables about maximum power efficiency of thermodynamic steady state from the article by Odum, H.T. and Pinkerton, R.T (4). The statement of the principle appears to have evolved in this literature. First it was maximum power, now it has been restated as maximum 'empower'. The main declaration appears to be in the words of C.Giannantoni, 

::::The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka-Odum) is generally considered as the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems (C.Giannantoni 2000, § 13, p. 155)

::His related mathematical work is referenced above.

::*'''my plan?'''
:::First ask, "What is a scientific principle or law?" and try not to answer this question with symbolic mathematical logic proof, but rather instrumental proof.
:::Second. Construct a simple galvanoscope (which appears to be an uncalibrated ammeter). Observe that this one instrument involves at least each of magnetism, electricity, chemical corrosion, mass transfer and heat dissipation all at the same time. Construct to verify for yourself...it gets quite hot with a 9 volt battery! 
:::Third. If this instrument is involved in the quantification of any of the laws of thermo(heat)dynamics  then it seems to me that it is also involved in the quantification of magnetism, electricity and chemical corrosion at the same time.  
:::Fourth. There is no fourth, simply ponder and play with the instrument.
:::Fifth. See if you can divorce "power" (voltage and current) from the instrument. 
:::Sixth. If you cannot divorce power from the instrument, and the instrument is involved with the quantification of the laws of thermodynamics, then power -''and therefore time''- also appears to be involved with the quantification of the laws of thermodynamics. 
:::Seven. Pause and consider, how many scientific laws can be demonstrated with this instrument? This will do for now cept to say that max power principle involves heat and current and max empower will involve corrosion and mass transfer.

Sholto, I ordered your suggested book: Giannantoni, C. (2000).  After I receive it, I'll give it a read and see what this is all about?  I know I've read a little about Lotka somewhere; and loosely I know that all this 'exergy', 'emergy', empower, stuff is just a backwards British way (using sign changes) of talking about the SI 'free energy' (exergy, with correlations), 'entropy' (extropy, with correlations), etc.  So why don't you give me some time to read your book, maybe a month or so, and we can possibly do a short paragraph on ecological evolution in the [[thermodynamic evolution]] article.  Also, I work with a group of people that runs the largest fourth law of thermodynamics list on the internet (we are a top three search on dogpile.com for "fourth law of thermodynamics"): [http://www.humanthermodynamics.com/4th-Law-Variations.html List 4th Laws]; thus, if what you are talking about is true we can add your contribution there.  P.S. here at Wikipedia we just write concise, to the point, referenced articles, we don't build things. Talk later:--[[User:Wavesmikey|Wavesmikey]] 20:01, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

Also, power and time are already both accounted for in the 1st and 2nd laws combined in the form of an energy balance on a thermodynamic system.  The concept of thermodynamic "state" accounts for time, i.e. the energetic difference between to states, and work, which is power multiplied by time, is accounted for in either Helmholtz or Gibbs free energy, depending upon system constraints. I'll jot a note to your user page when I receive the book. Toodle-oo:--[[User:Wavesmikey|Wavesmikey]] 20:14, 5 December 2005 (UTC)


::*Thank you for your kind comments Wavesmikey. I notice your humanthermodynamics site references Jorgensen as giving a statement of 4th law as maximum power. In fact Jorgensen and Odum combined their approaches. In S.E. Jorgensen, S.N.Nielsen, H.Mejer (1995) 'Emergy,  environ,  exergy  and  ecological  modelling   (I995) ''Ecological  Modelling''  77, pp. 99-109, they state that,
::: "Emergy  calculations  have  the  same  aim  as  exergy:  to  capture  the  energy  hidden  in  the  organization  and  construction  of living organisms." 

::In S.E.Jorgensen, M.T.Brown, H.T.Odum (2004) 'Energy hierarchy and transformity in the universe', ''Ecological Modelling'', 178, pp. 17-28, they state that "Lotka's principle of self-organizing for maximum power, offered as the fourth energy law" (p. 18). 

::I've just noticed also that Tribus (see above references) first references Odum & Pinkerton re: maximum power, and then goes on to talk about the Onsager relations in the same sub-chapter. Lets reconvene after you've had a look at the book.  [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 22:45, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

==4th law, maximum power & impedance==

::Perhaps I do not understand this 4th law, but from what I have read here it seems to be totally equivalent to the 3 original laws. (including the 0th of course). Any comments? [[Lagrangian]]

:::*Not sure. As far as I have been able to ascertain it is equivalent to the [[maximum power theorem]], and is a necessary consequence of the  the 0,1,2,3 laws. But I don't think they are equivalent, because I don't think that any of these laws tell us anything about the load power and power effiency of an electromagnetic energy transformation process... or do they? [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 11:05, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

:::: Check out the [[Impedance matching]] article. The idea of maximum power transfer is not limited to electromagnetic energy. If you have a body of mass M colliding with a second body, the maximum energy transfer occurs when the second body has the same mass M. When you have two resistors in series with a fixed voltage and the first resistor has resistance R, the maximum power is developed in the second resistor when it has the same resistance R. Any kind of wave, mechanical, light, quantum, etc., will be reflected from a boundary unless the "impedances" on either side of the boundary match. The reflection means incomplete power transfer. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 00:28, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::* I put a table and graph of max power efficiency on the [[maximum power theorem]] entry to try and make this point clear, but I haven't seen it associated with mass before...Does this apply to mass transfer also? And also apply to "thermodynamic" waves (ie. energy spectrum within the thermal bandwidth)? And what happens at the photosynthetic boundary (ie. does a leaf perform impedance matching to obtain the maximum energy transfer from solar insolation?). What about the transfer of energy in the muscles of humans and other animals? What about a car engine or bike - is changing gears a form of impedance matching? [[User:Sholto Maud|Sholto Maud]] 04:20, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

::::::I don't think gear changing is a form of impedance matching. Usually you have something like P = Fe Ve = Fw Vw where Fe and Fw are the force of the engine and the wheel respectively and Ve and Vw are the velocities of the engine and the wheel respectively, and P is power. The values of Fe and Ve are rather fixed, but you want to vary Fw and Vw according to your needs, and thats what the gears do. When going up hill, or accelerating, you want a large Fw and you settle for a small Vw, but when cruising, you want high Vw and only need a small Fw. I'm not sure about the other cases.

== The overview, etc. == 

USER PAR:: I am considering your revert of the overview an act of vandalism. My comments in the discussion should support this. This is a collective effort. Please contact me to discuss discrepencies in philosophy and do not merely revert again! [[Lagrangian]]

: A few points -
:# You have the wrong person. My edits to the overview corrected some errors, I did not revert.
:# The way it works is NOT that you make edits and everyone else begs you to change them on the talk page. If you make an error, then I or someone else will correct it. If you make an inappropriate edit, then I or someone else will revert it. If both parties can't come to an agreement, THEN we obtain a consensus on the talk page. 
:Lets get to work on this page, I agree it can be improved.[[User:PAR|PAR]] 15:58, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

I'd like to continue my work. Upon further study, this page needs some serious edits. At present it relies primarily on outside articles to describe the many aspects, i.e. the laws, the system, the history, etc. I would like to try to elaborate all of these aspects in this article, taken in a much more general view, and with a more scientific bent. If anyone has any objections or suggestions I would greatly appreciate them. Thank you. [[Lagrangian]]

I'd like to rewrite the overview. It has no relevance to thermodynamics as a subject, and dwells on thermodynamics as a college class. I will do this now, and if there is a problem with what I do, please let me know before reverting it. Thank you. I also find it odd that Gibbs is not mentioned at all in the history discussion? He was definitely the father of modern thermo. [[Lagrangian]]

: Regarding correction of errors in the overview

:* Thermodynamics does not "attempt to study" it studies.
:* A system is not separated from "the surroundings", it is separated from "its surroundings". There is no such place as "the surroundings" without reference to a particular system.
:* Introducing the concept of moles as a measure of the number of particles is not necessary at this point. It is a concept which is more likely to require explanation than the concept of "number of particles", and it is less universal.
:* The internal energy is not "formed" by pressure, temperature, etc, but it can be expressed in terms of these variables.
:* There are many more than just 4 thermodynamic potentials. To say there are only three plus internal energy is an error.
:* Can we just express a list as A, B, C, D, E, and F, rather than A, B and C, D and E, F?
:[[User:PAR|PAR]] 17:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

Regarding The Revert::

When I viewed the page this morning it had been reverted to the overview originally there. I responded to this observation. I understand the rules of the process and I appreciate and agree with your corrections. I merely did not want the page to be restored by the original writer of the overview over hubris. I apologize if I offended, I was merely upset that my thoughts had been completely disregarded.

Regarding Corrections::

You are absolutely right on nearly all of your corrections, I missed several of the semantics errors. In terms of the potentials, absolutely correct, legendre transforms can be applied indefinitely and can change the variables of description to many more than 4. I suppose there are 4 commonly used potentials, however, one could (theoretically) perform transforms into various other tangent spaces.

The listing I used in order to couple together fields in science and engineering with similar background. Purely organisational. 

I disagree with your comment on moles, but will not press this further, "many particles" does not quite give the intense magnitude applicable in thermodynamics, and so I used moles. However, I do understand your reasoning.

Articles Focus:

I would be happy to work with you on this, clearly you have a good grasp of the subject. At present I don't think the article gives a good conception of the incredible applicability and usefulness of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics apply's in nearly every field and is no longer merely the study of "engines". Thermodynamics is essential to all science and I feel this article misses that. There is no mention of Gibbs in the history, who is truly the father of modern thermo. Carnot is essential but antiquated, and while Boyle is mentioned we have no discussion of Charles. I think that this page should try to emphasize all the applications. Would like to hear feedback. I apologize for any misactions, Im still somewhat new to this.

:Just by way of history, the article was a mess until [[User:Wavesmikey|Wavesmikey]] cleaned it up to roughly its present form a few weeks ago. I think I am right in saying his philosophy was to not go into great detail in this article, but to give introductions to the main articles, which would then give the real details, otherwise this article would be huge. In my mind he may have pared back a little too much, or maybe the present sections could be kept the same length but better written, perhaps linked together a bit more tightly, but the improvement he brought was great. What improvements did you have in mind? [[User:PAR|PAR]] 20:41, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

== The point of the overview section ==

I am wondering if there is any point in having an "Overview section". The Introduction has as much an overview character as the section iteself and isn't even that long. So the two should probably be merged, with the engine picture kept on the right. [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 19:14, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
:OK, I merged the overvie section into the intro and reduced the length a bit and reworded. [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 08:03, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

==Statistical and Classical thermodynamics==

I understand there are two such approaches to thermodynamics.<blockquote>Thermodynamics (from the Greek thermos meaning heat and dynamis meaning power) is a branch of physics that studies the effects of temperature, pressure, and volume changes on physical systems at the macroscopic scale</blockquote>This is classical thermodynamics,and statistical thermodynamics deals with microscopic world (statistically).Correct me.--[[User:Sahodaran|Sahodaran]] 04:16, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

I understand that statistical thermodynamics is just one branch of statistical mechanics. [[User:Edsanville|Ed Sanville]] 08:06, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

In my head, stat. thermo. is another name for [[statistical mechanics]]. [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 08:07, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

:The absolutely best thermo book in the world is "Thermodynamics and an introduction to thermostatistics" by Herbert B. Callen. The last chapter is on thermostatistics, and I cannot figure out from this chapter what thermostatistics is. The chapter is basically concerned with an extended first law which states the conservation of momentum and angular momentum as well as energy, and with other conserved quantities and the symmetries associated with them. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 14:36, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for the responses,[[User:Karol Langner|Karol Langner]] has added a mention about this in the article,and a redirect from [[statistical thermodynamics]]--[[User:Sahodaran|Sahodaran]] 11:18, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
:Yes, I merged the little content I found there. Ideally, I think it should be gracefully merged into the introduction somehow (or maybe a different section). [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 23:18, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

==Statement of the Laws==

I replaced the complex statement of the laws with the straightforward versions that are given in the main articles. It makes no sense to have a complicated version of the laws in an overview article, and a simple version in the main articles. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 23:17, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
:I totally agree. [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 09:49, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[Thermal science]] ==

I just added a redirect from [[Thermal science]] to [[Thermodynamics]]. I'm not sure this is correct however, since Thermodynamics seems to be a subdiscipline of Thermal science, but it seemed better than a red link. I invite those with knowledge of this field to correct or replace my redirect as appropriate. [[User:Mike Dillon|Mike Dillon]] 23:43, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

:I think thermal science should consist of not only the equilibrium cases (which is what thermodynamics is about) but about [[Heat]] transfer too.Heat transfer,of course,is non-equilibrium case.I am not able to pin-point to an exact link right now.--[[User:Sahodaran|Sahodaran]] 03:00, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

::No, that is all thermodynamics. There is classical, [[equilibrium state]] thermodynamics and [[nonequilibrium thermodynamics]], which needs more content, mind you, and I notice is not mentioned in this article. [[User:Karol Langner|Karol]] 07:51, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

If I were to classify [[thermal science]] somehow, I would say it is rather an ''applied'' thermodynamics. For reference see this [http://www.me.umn.edu/education/courses/me3324/Intro.html thermal science course description]. I notice "thermal science" is also used in [[nuclear engineering]] - see

With respects to the previous thread on the 4th law, contributers might be interested to read the following abstract snip 

<blockquote>The traditional Differential Calculus often shows its limits when describing living systems. These in fact present such a richness of characteristics that are, in the majority of cases, much wider than the description capabilities of the usual differential equations. Such an aspect became particularly evident during the research (completed in 2001) for an appropriate formulation of Odum's Maximum Em-Power Principle ('''''proposed by the Author as a possible Fourth Thermodynamic Principle''''').

In reviewing the article, I have found that the following issues need to be addressed.
*Much of the article is missing inline citations.  I realise the information is readily available in any textbook, but that should may it ''easier'' to find citable sources.  Main articles of summary-style sections can probably be mined for appropriate references quite easily.
*The laws of thermodynamics section should be cleaned up to match proper style for [[Wikipedia:Embedded list|embedded lists]].  Despite being covered in detail in their own article, I'd suggest expanding the information on each law a little more as well.
::{{fixed}} by using tabular format for emphasis of this important section (also felt a list with a lot of text was harder to read) and adding additional text from the individual articles to fill out the descriptions.  '''David Hollman''' ([[User talk:Dhollm|Talk]]) 09:55, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

As long as work is being done towards fixing these issues, I see no reason to delist the article.  Some other points/suggestions, unrelated to GA status:
*I find the lead moving image very distracting.  I don't know if it's possible, but could it be changed to a startable-stopable movie?
*Is the a convenient way to expand the "Thermodynamic states" section?  The summary style explanation given here seems a bit brief, but may well be complete as is.

== Untitled ==

Thermodynamics deals with the transformation of energy into work and heat.
Work is what is equivalent to "lifting a mass" = opposing a field (gravitational, electromagnetic, nuclear...).
Heat is what is rejected to the "universe" raising the universes temperature (energy rejected can't be used as "work").
Thus the concept of entropy (the "state function" of the universe that increases as energy is rejected as heat).
There is no "heat energy" involved, heat is what is rejected to the universe as processes are carried out.
The main confussion in the definition of Thermodynamics and mixup with Heat Transfer is when laymen confuse the etymology of the word thermodynamics with its current use in science and engineering. It's like confusing "atom" with something indivisible,as its greek roots suggest.   <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/65.182.27.96|65.182.27.96]] ([[User talk:65.182.27.96|talk]]) 17:02, 7 April 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

The Second Law.
In an isolated system Entropy increases.  In an isolated system entropy is constant.  People you can NOT have it both ways.  This confusion is horrible.[[Special:Contributions/71.31.154.4|71.31.154.4]] ([[User talk:71.31.154.4|talk]]) 04:55, 24 October 2009 (UTC)

The Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Entropy of an isolated system increases.  Entropy of an isolated system is constant.  These two juxtaposed statements are direct contradictions.  This confusion, as well as the failure to define the terms entropy and energy (as well as equilibrium) before using them in the Laws is surprising to say the least.  I suggest an attempt to roughly explain them Energy is the ability to do work, Entropy is the measure of the disorder in a system, Equilibrium is the state of a system in which no work can be done and thermal equality is (macroscopically) obtained.  Not to mention defining "Open", "Closed" and "Isolated" "systems".  This is basic pedagogy.

:While some of the historical information might be useful, I would recommend against presenting it in that particular form.  The men listed on the web page you mention are indeed influential, but the choice to present them each as a founder of a "school" is misleading, in that all those institutions existed before the individual arrived or anyone started studying thermodynamics there.  As far as I can tell, the selection of that particular list of individuals, while it may have merit, is derived from author's personal opinion rather than any generally recognized list 12 founding schools or people.  [[User:Bdentremont|Bdentremont]] ([[User talk:Bdentremont|talk]]) 01:51, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

::As to your first point, you seem to be confusing the founding of a school verses founding of a school of thought, e.g. the [[University of Geneva]] was founded in 1559, whereas the [[Lausanne school]], a school of teaching or thought physical economics, surrounding [[Leon Walras]] and his students at the University of Geneva, existed from about 1970 to 1910. This is what we are talking with each of the twenty known “schools of thermodynamics”. There is more than one textbook (or article) reference for each of the twenty articles connected to the above page, with full discussion found in the reference as to who each founder or leader of that school is. A few example quotes:

:::*[[Ilya Prigogine]]: “The '''Viennese school''' was led by [[Gustav Jaumann]]."
:::*[[Pierre Duhem]]: “The chiefs of the '''Dutch school''' are [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Van der Waals]], [[Hendrik Willem Bakhuis Roozeboom|Roozboom]], and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff |Van’t Hoff]].”
:::*[[John Schmitz]] (2007): “The University of Berlin was the world’s leading institute for thermodynamics and is therefore also called the '''Berlin School''' of Thermodynamics [led by], [[Hermann Helmholtz]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], and [[Walter Nernst]]."
:::*Ralph Anderson (1999): “[[Ilya Prigogine]] is founder of the '''Brussels school'''”.
:::*Anon (1970): "[http://www.eoht.info/page/Istvan+Gyarmati István Gyarmati] is founder of the modern '''Hungarian school''' of thermodynamics."

::There's literally literally dozens of these types of references, indicating that these various schools are common inside jargon. In any event, the linked page has been (updated more today) give giving overview on the twenty-one (or more) known schools of thermodynamics, and the newly made "school connectivity diagram", showing their interrelations, is pictured here. 

::I would suggest that a picture of the table of twelve people representative of each school (along with the connectivity diagram), go in the article. If you have some sort of objection to any particular person not being the best representation of that school, please state your reasoning. Whatever the case, if no one wants this type of pictorial overview of how the subject of thermodynamics came to be, then I guess I will leave it be? Yet the one lone picture of [[Sadi Carnot]] in the present [[thermodynamics]] article hardly does justice. --[[User:Libb Thims|Libb Thims]] ([[User talk:Libb Thims|talk]]) 19:03, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

:If you read the notes in the modern translation of Carnot's work you will find that of the four of five things he stated based on mathmatical derivations or whatever, only the calculation of thermodynamic driving force based on temperature diffferential between the heat source and the heat sink, which is the concept of thermodynamic efficiency, was correct.

:::I agree that Sadi Carnot doesn't represent all of thermodynamics and appreciate your contributions to broaden this section.  While I understand that they are intended to be schools of thought, I still feel that the fact that the names coincide with intitutions which are also called "schools" would be somewhat confusing to someone not already at least vaguely familiar with the names of the people, the institutions, and the dates.  Your assertion that the "various schools are common inside jargon" may in fact be a good incentive to omit them under [[Wikipedia:Make technical articles understandable]] which suggests that technical jargon be avoid if possible.

:::I also now notice that the figures and references that you have added to the article all are sourced from or refer to a website that you administer.  While not strictly prohibited, it is definitely a concern under [[Wikipedia:No original research]].  If you could reference back you your own sources rather than your article on the topic, I think you could make much stronger case.  Particularly, I think that the assertion that these constitute a set of "the main schools" may constitute your own conclusion, particularly considering that the list on the source page has expanded from 12 to 20 during the course of this discussion. If you have a good source, other than yourself, to suggest these schools as a set of "main schools" (and you are obviously far more likely to know where to find this than I) I would really like to see that in the article.

:::I mean these as suggestions on presentation, not an attack on your work, and am not making any edits or reversions to the article right now.

I understand your concerns regarding references, however, I used to contribute heavily to Wikipedia articles (creating about 180 new ones), adding in upwards of 50-60 references per article. I now do this externally and to avoid contributing to Wikipedia articles, except only bits here and there, in such a way that I only commit minimal energy to the edit, instead focusing energy on my own project and objectives in collecting knowledge. 

As for your concerns about original research, these are the first twelve schools of thermodynamics formed, called “schools” according to references, listed in purely chronological order, not my personal list of favorites. 

Regarding inside jargon, these school names are all common terms people find when reading about thermodynamics. To exemplify, a popular school of thermodynamics name used commomly in recent years is the "[[MaxEnt school]]" ([http://www.eoht.info/page/MaxEnt+school MaxEnt school]), headed by [[Edwin Jaynes]] (one of the 21 schools that I know of so far), a term found on both the [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]] and the [[H-theorem]] articles. Small discrepancies do exist, however, in the naming and heads of these schools: e.g. some cite [[Theophile de Donder]] as being the founder of the Brussels school, whereas others cite [[Ilya Prigogine]] as being the founder; also some call it the “Brussels school”, whereas others call it the “Belgian school” (and other refer to it as the "Prigogine school"). The cited link connects to a main discussion page (with references), with in turn connects to more than twelve other dedicated pages (each giving multiple references and historical overview) as to who first began to refer to that school as a particular school of thermodynamics, its origin, naming issues, etc.

In any event, this is all the energy I can devote to this article at the moment and is the best (quick) way I know of to give the new-comer a oneshot overview picture of the history and framework of thermodynamics. Most people new to a subject tend to scan articles quickly, often reading photo captions over that of reading the whole article. I uploaded a new png version of the connectivity diagram (in the future I’ll make note of this). --[[User:Libb Thims|Libb Thims]] ([[User talk:Libb Thims|talk]]) 18:56, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

:I really liked the (removed) animation '''as an image''' though I am forced to agree it would be a bit too much for the top of the article.  The replacement seems more appropriate. I have a concern though that the image size is a bit large, and this is compounded by a very long caption.  However I think the caption text is valuable, as it gices a grounding by relating to real examples of a thermodynamic applications. I think that having such a concrete example is a great way to draw a reader into what can be for some a conceptualy difficult subject. I wonder if it would be better to move the image to introduction, and move some of the caption text to the main body?

== comment on Materialscientist's new edit ==

Dear Materialscientist, Your new edit is not good. It needs radical revision.

Probably you have not chosen the right place to put your edit; probably what you want to say should be said earlier in the article, in a more introductory place. Your comment about black holes is already made in the introduction, and does not need repeating in the section on the laws.

The section on the laws is not the place to talk about Einstein's predictions. It is not clear what you mean by saying that Einstein predicted spontaneous emission. Spontaneous thermal radiation was recognized by 1791. It is true that Einstein predicted stimulated emission. But stimulated emission is not explicitly dealt with by thermodynamics, which needs to regard it as a negative contribution to absorption and not as part of emission proper; Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity works only when this view is taken.

As it stands, the introduction section of the article lacks focus on the key ideas of thermodynamics, and some of its wording is loose. It does not tell the reader what are macroscopic and microscopic variables for the purposes of thermodynamics: the link to [[macroscopic scale]] does not do the job. Chemical composition is a main factor in present day thermodynamics, but hardly seems to be mentioned in the article. But what you want to say in your edit needs those key ideas.

You write of "laws which do not depend on the details of the systems under study or how they interact". This is too vague. Thermodynamics is about changes in systems that can be described by macroscopic thermodynamic variables, but do not require knowledge of their microscopic variables.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 12:30, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

== The diagram-table of kinds of system ==

Thermodynamics distinguishes adiabatically closed and diabatically closed systems. In a sense, it this distinction on which the whole of thermodynamics is built. It is desirable to include this distinction in the article. An adiabatically closed system can exchange work but not heat; a diabatically closed system can exchange heat but not work. The present text of the article simply refers to the diagram-table that distinguishes isolated, closed and open systems, but I do not know how to edit such a diagram. Please would the editor who knows how to do it let me know, or do it himself?[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 02:12, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

== Credit ==

From the start of the article, it says that thermodynamics is a branch of physics ''and chemistry''. . . . . no, clearly the thermodynamics is very important for chemistry, but the branch itself originated on physics and thus only belongs to physics. Application of thermodynamics on the field of chemistry is studied by [[Chemical thermodynamics]] and [[Thermochemistry]]. Otherwise, what these derivatives are for? I'm confused, you know.--[[User:Twicemost|Twicemost]] ([[User talk:Twicemost|talk]]) 05:29, 22 April 2008 (UTC)


very true, thermodynamics has its origins in physics and is just used in chemistry, the same as quantum mechanics is used in quantum chemistry.  i doubt anyone would say that quantum mechanics is a branch of chemistry  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.36.181.171|24.36.181.171]] ([[User talk:24.36.181.171|talk]]) 01:23, 23 June 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I also agree that it just does not make sense to say that thermodynamics is a branch of chemistry. It would be misleading for the readers. Surely chemistry or chemists have contributed to it, but that does not change the fact that TD is one of the fundamental subfields of physics, just like electromagnetism, or quantum mechanics or classical mechanics. -Ur  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.103.0.107|71.103.0.107]] ([[User talk:71.103.0.107|talk]]) 09:53, 12 July 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

There lies the rub, for What is "Chemistry", what is "Physics"? Where does one end and the other begin? I took Physical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, ... I took 4 physics courses and many engineering courses and what I got from it is that the "point of view" of the physicist, the chemists and the engineers were quite different on the same subjects or phenomena. Thermodynamics is one of the most fundamental concepts for all of the physical sciences, it's laws are obeyed by the universe weather it is at a subatomic, atomic, "classical" or astrophysical level, all from concepts initially derived form a practical concern with combustion in order to produce work. Weather one does mechanics or electricity or astrophysics or nuclear physics or chemistry... one always ends up using the laws of thermodynamics to solve quite a lot of problems.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/190.241.6.32|190.241.6.32]] ([[User talk:190.241.6.32|talk]]) 08:34, 5 April 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

When thermodynamics began, there was no distinbction between physics, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, astrophysics,...  It was called science then.  So, the area does not 'belong' to either, but it is a fundamental part of chemistry and of physics (or "of physics and of chemistry").

Now 'science' has been classified. Thermodynamics does not discuss the breaking of chemical bonds. It's a theory in physics, with applications to chemistry and innumerable natural sciences.

== history ==

am not really sure about the history section written about ancient times.  Those early ideas on void spaces and atomic philosophy have no real contribution aside from influencing future scientist, but the way its presented on this page makees it seem as those thermodynamics existed millenium ago, which of course is not true.  I dont object to those points being there but i think there needs to be better effort to clear draw a distinction between the early ideas, which are not thermodynamics, and the actual science of thermodynamics.[[User:Tomasz Prochownik|Tomasz Prochownik]] ([[User talk:Tomasz Prochownik|talk]]) 07:26, 22 June 2008 (UTC)



Also you mentioned that Avicenna invented the first air thermometer, but thats not quiet the whole story. Ctesibius, Heron, and Philo were all aware of the elasticity of air and they knew that when heated it expanded and vice versa and they in fact built several mechanisms demonstrating this principle, particularly in Heron's Pneumatica. In reality Avic. would have had access and knowledge of these works so he in fact just used their theories and the devices they built to measure temperature and some sources claim in fact that they did built an air thermometer themselves http://www.enotes.com/history-fact-finder/science-invention/who-invented-thermometer. whether they built an air thermometer is in no doubt, its just that they most likely didnt use to measure temperature, but never the less their ideas and inventions are crucial Avic. just used what they made to gauge temp. difference. I thought id let you know so you alter to include those ideas, you know before i actually do it for you soooooo. Tomasz Prochownik (talk) 06:41, 26 June 2008 (UTC)


ya check when i posted that comment, and you haven't changed anything, both the sources you list under the air thermometer are brutally inappropriate, Briffault one having something along the lines, some say he used an air thermometer, and the other source witting one sentence on it. The problem being neither book is source is about the history of science. give me a source that explains his thermometer, how it worked, and how he built it. I like your little contribution of principle parameter, it would be pretty hard for it to be that since it could not tell the temperature, only relative temp., since temp. scales didn't exist at the time, also it would have been subject to barometric pressure. what compounds this even further, as stated before neither of your sources claim how it was built, how it worked, or anything to do about this device, except a sentence, i guess you thought you'd fill in the gaps huhhh. As far as measuring air temp. a rudimentary device was built by philo http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&id=qfmS7g4JzjwC&dq=Principles+and+Methods+of+Temperature+Measurement&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=3rLkeqdZz5&sig=tV2YrszNevkr61Eatbrk0YDiB4A&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result. of course avic. had access to these works also. Last, but not least these early devices are not thermometers, but more accurately thermascope's. any comments

as far as your knew contribution, well once again filled with some distortions as usual. Heron also conducted experiments on voids, but of course his don't count right, because as you would have us believe muslims invented experiments, right lol, but that's soon going to be addressed. Ya conducted the first experiments on a void, really were does it say that in the Stanford source specifically, as far as the other source Zahoor thats just a plain joke, kind of like you. Last but not least, this contribution is absolutely worthless to the history of thermodynamics. Why, simple show me the connection between this and thermodynamics, list one source that links this as being important to thermodynamics. Ideas on voids were just ideas, based on Greek philosophy. all the early ref. on this page are just precursor ideas to thermo., ideas like voids or atomic philosophy, not thermo. itself. what makes this contribution even more worthless is the fact he conducted "experiment", and i use the word loosely not experiments, he used them to demonstrate something totally untrue, vaccum's can exist. Ahhh what a monumental contribution he used water plungers to prove the exact opposite of what is true. You've really outdone yourself here jagged lol. So pretty much this little bit is gone unless you can find some respectable source liking this to thermodynamics. I don't care about you interpretation, find me a respectable source that links this to thermodynamics, quote one for me please, am dying to know. Am now also making changes to the thermometer part as well, since you wont I and you better start looking for better sources on this device cause this ain't cutting it sorry.[[User:Tomasz Prochownik|Tomasz Prochownik]] ([[User talk:Tomasz Prochownik|talk]]) 07:02, 14 July 2008 (UTC)

== Etymology ==

I suggest the etymology given:- "Roughly, heat means "energy in transit" and dynamics relates to "movement"; thus, in essence thermodynamics studies the movement of energy and how energy instills movement" is really unsatisfactory for a work of reference. To say heat is "energy in transit" is obscure, to have the quality of heat a body has only to have a steady temperature above absolute zero, there is no need for the "energy to be in transit". Conversely, "dynamics" is used in many branches to convey the concept of movement, electrodynamics and electrostatics are good examples where "dynamic" is used to distinguish between moving and none moving charge. The analogy is compelling. To paraphrase Thermodynamics - "energy in transit" "movement" is prolix, using only one word for movement is much better style. By way of comparison, Thermodynamics "heat" and "movement" indicates very well the actual fact that thermodynamics is the science that converts heat energy to mechanical movement and viceversa, nothing "roughly" about this! --[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 21:41, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

{{hst|reason=Excerpt from one of the references re Rational Thermodynamics}}
2.3.3. Rational thermodynamics (RT)
Rational thermodynamics is another class of microscale
thermodynamic approaches. Initially developed
by Coleman [19], Eringen [31], Noll [64], Truesdell
[72], this approach has proven to be a useful component
of methods for deriving constitutive equations [51]. The
method is mathematically rigorous and is built on principles
that lead to certain mathematical forms for the
energy and constitutive functions [31]. Although the
principles have some mathematical appeal, Maugin
[59] has pointed out that they are actually only working
hypotheses while Vavruch [73] claims they are more
accurately called useful rules. These rules include the
following:
• equipresence—if an independent variable is present in
one of the constitutive equations, it will, a priori, be
present in all; and
• memory—present effects are dictated by the past as
well as the present values of the independent
variables.
Operationally, equipresence dictates that each
dependent variable will be a function of all of the system
�s independent variables, except when the presence
of the variable contradicts some law of physics or material
symmetry. It leads to a postulated form of functional
dependence of internal energy that is far more
complex than the ET form and seemingly unrelated.
Memory further requires that the dependent variables
be functions of both past and present values of the independent
variables.
168 W.G. Gray, C.T. Miller / Advances in Water Resources 28 (2005) 161–180
In the case of flow in porous media, these two
hypotheses impose some generality that is seemingly
needlessly complicated. A somewhat simplified approximation
that relieves some of the mathematical tedium
has been put forth [48]. Maugin [59] also states that
RT assumes notions that are precisely defined in ET to
exist in any dynamic state. In RT, absolute temperature
and entropy are considered primitive concepts and are
believed to hold far from equilibrium; but they have
no precise physical interpretation or physical relation
to their ET counterparts. Materials are allowed to have
a memory, and the concept of local equilibrium is not
necessarily enforced.
RT is the thermodynamic approach most widely used
in considering macroscale porous medium systems
[14,37,46]. The problem of lack of correspondence between
microscale entropy and temperature between ET
and RT is compounded when the RT hypotheses are
made at the macroscale such that this approach can be
physically unsatisfying. For example, the use of derivatives
of energy with respect to saturation as the definition
of capillary pressure e.g. as reviewed in [47] and
the appearance of three different mathematical definitions
of pressure [14] are indications that the mathematical
elegance of the RT approach is achieved while
sacrificing the ability to relate easily terms appearing
in derived conservation and constitutive equations to
experimental measurements and observations.

 == Rational thermodynamics ==
{{main|Rational thermodynamics}}
The classical methods of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics do not allow for a description of states and processes outside equilibrium. The methods of rational thermodynamics eliminate the difficulties of the previous theories. Rational thermodynamics is a purely phenomenological and macroscopic theory<ref>Gray, William G., Miller, Cass T. "Thermodynamically constrained averaging theory approach for modeling flow and transport phenomena in porous medium systems: 1. Motivation and overview" ''Advances in Water Resources 28 (2005) 168-169'' [http://www.physics.purdue.edu/flow/2005.AWR.TCAT1.pdf]</ref> disregarding molecular structure and its ultimate objective is to describe the actual physical phenomena in course of time and space as faithfully as possible. For example, the behaviour of continuous systems subject to mechanical and thermal solicitations. It is true that statistical thermodynamics offers a deeper insight, but it cannot in principle replace the phenomenological description, because the results of a statistical theory are always interpreted in terms of a phenomenological theory. Rational thermodynamics can be regarded as a true thermodynamic image of actual physical phenomena.

Rational thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of continuous systems and it is a mathematical theory established by mathematicians and physicists such as [[Clifford Truesdell]]. Its exact form described by Miroslav Šilhavý<ref>{{cite book | author=Silhavy, M. | title=The Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Continuous Media | publisher=Springer, Berlin | year=1997 | isbn=3-540-58378-5}}</ref> is based almost exclusively on mathematical arguments and is accessible only for chemists with a very good background in modern mathematics. However, rational thermodynamics can also be presented in a simplified form<ref>Kratochvil J., Silhavy M. J. "On thermodynamics of non-equilibrium processes" ''Non-Equilib. Thermodyn. 1982, 7, 339''</ref> in which the physical aspect of the theory is emphasized and the mathematical technicalities are omitted. In such an approach, the theory is demonstrated on comparatively simple models and on examples based on plausible physical and mathematical assumptions. This version of rational thermodynamics is aimed at non-mathematicians, chemists, physicists and engineers studying especially equilibrium, mixtures, transport phenomena and chemical kinetics.

::Petr10 should not be untraceable. My e-mail address is now registered on Wikipedia. I don't know how to make it 'traceable'.
::Yes, I am new in Wikipedia and I am surprised by the hysterical tone of the reactions to my addition to Wikipedia. Is it always like this in Wikipedia? Calm down, people!

::This is not a joke, it's a serious scientific matter. That somebody has not heard of rational thermodynamics does not mean that it does not exist. Anyway, the text taken from one of the references and included in one of the comments proves that it exists. If it exists, it should be in Wikipedia. If it is not there, it must be added.
::Only one reaction has a merit: yes, the main article is not there. It will be there shortly. It has 34 references so it takes time to write it Wikipedia-way.

::I will restore my addition when I am finished with the main article.

Bob, a shortened quote from 'Thermodynamics: A Dynamical Systems Approach' by Wassim M. Haddad, Vijay Sekhar Chellaboina, & Sergey G. Nersesov, Princeton University Press, 2005:

''In the last half of the twentieth century, thermodynamics was reformulated as a global nonlinear field theory with the ultimate objective to determine the independent field variables. This aspect of thermodynamics became known as rational thermodynamics. As a result of this approach, modern continuum thermodynamics was developed using theories from elastic materials, viscous materials, and materials with memory. The main difference between classical thermodynamics and rational thermodynamics can be traced back to the fact that in rational thermodynamics the second law is not interpreted as a restriction on the transformations a system can undergo, but rather as a restriction on the system's constitutive equations.''

Another edited quote from Internet:

''RT is mathematically rigorous yet physically well founded theory for irreversible thermodynamics. It diverges from the classical theory to assume temperature and entropy to be primitive variables, not dependent on something else (like mass, length etc.). This enables it to postulate the existence of these quantities in situations far from equilibrium.''

::Assertions such as ''The classical methods of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics do not allow for a description of states and processes outside equilibrium.'' indicate a profound misunderstanding (to put it kindly) of classical thermodynamics. Equilibrium (in terms of "classical thermodynamics" is a condition where no energy is flowing (being transported). When energy is introduced into a system by definition energy flow is initiated, equilibrium no longer applies. Now it doesn't matter if you are firing up a steam locomotive, pulling the pin from a hand grenade or forcing a fluid through a porous membrane (typical non-equilibrium conditions), thermodynamics as based on the works of Boltzmann et al, explains matters quite well.

::Petr10, do you agree? Do you have observations where it is clear that it is failure of classical thermodynamics and not a failure in the observer? Perhaps you could start show just how the second law of thermodynamics is "''rather as a restriction on the system's constitutive equations''". This would be helpful because the 2nd law has at its root the concept that you don't get energy from nothing.--[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 08:34, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

I am terribly sorry to disappoint you but I cannot argue with you and I cannot explain anything myself. I just want to show on Wikipedia an article that explains the situation with rational thermodynamics. That's all. RT has friends and enemies, see the discussion from which I took my earlier quote in [http://imechanica.org/node/2028 Journal Club Theme of October 2007: Irreversible thermodynamics of continuous media] - in that discussion, Kosta Volokh does not like RT.

The article that I want to show has not been published due to the death of the author who also wrote more general articles about thermodynamics, e.g. [http://www.chemicke-listy.cz/docs/full/2002_05_01.pdf CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS OF MODERN IRREVERSIBLE THERMODYNAMICS].

: Petr10, you say "I cannot explain anything myself" which makes one wonder why you want to edit here. The idea of an encyclopedia is to have a reasonably reliable store of knowledge available for consultation. Wikipedia is a very attractive proposition for people who wish to publicise their own point of view, since Thermodynamics is a rather obscure subject there are many want to post here. Bearing this in mind would you mind putting your contributions in a separate article? If you cannot show the link between Rational thermodynamics and classical thermodynamics, then Rational thermodynamics has no place in this article.--[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 19:59, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

Exactly! A "reliable store of knowledge available for consultation" is what I want. I want to contribute to that. That's one reason why I am doing it. (But it's more like an obstacle course.) Putting my "contributions in a separate article" is what I want (I mentioned it earlier). It will certainly be reliable!

You and I cannot understand everything! To be able to explain RT to you, I would have to study a lot of things and you would have to study a lot of things otherwise you would not understand it anyway even if I am able to explain it to you. People who have the right background and are really interested will benefit from my contribution.

"If you cannot show the link between Rational thermodynamics and classical thermodynamics, then Rational thermodynamics has no place in this article" is worrying. Of course there is a strong link but not necessarily the easy way for everybody to understand.

Your article is called 'Thermodynamics'. It is not called 'Classical thermodynamics' and it is not called 'Thermodynamics in 19th century'. That's why a link to my article (not necessarily the text that I put in originally) must be in 'Thermodynamics'.

A lot is happening and if you decide to ignore it because you personally cannot understand it, you are hurting Wikipedia. There are many people in the world who can understand it. Some of these people will be able to improve my article or extend it.

Just an addendum: 'Rational Thermodynamics' has been around for decades. I've a dozen old photocopies of articles from the one journal that published the articles, which requires significant applied mathematical knowledge to read. Petr10's first, long definition was my understanding of it's general gist. However, it also tries to place classical thermodynamics on a rational foundation: some of these problems are discussed in English in the books by Bridgman. The papers are all axiomatic.

== Lay translation for the masses ==

I'm considering putting in an addendum at the bottom of the article to give some meaning to the equations found on this article.  Many people come to this source to understand the material better as well as learn the history of the subject being related.  There are a lot of significant points, but the lay person is going to get lost without having some bases of "Delta H".  Some general ideas or suggestions if this is going to significantly contribute or take away from the material before I begin trying to figure out how to translate this into commonese?

Good idea to add translations.  On a related point, the article contains unattributed statements including purported quotations without sources.  I have replaced one example with referenced quotes.

== Entropy and life ==

In a recent edit by Chjoaygame it states - "The evidence we have so far is that life has [[evolution|evolved]] apparently from non-life, and this is is contradictory to a belief in a universal tendency to heat death". This is not true. The evolution of life on Earth does not result in a net decrease in entropy. The decrease in entropy due to  life forms is more than compensated for by accompanying increase in the surroundings. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 09:46, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

:Dear PAR, thank you for this. Individuals live and die. No need to appeal to increase of entropy in the surroundings. Cycles appear and disappear. Thermodynamics works because one chooses one's system and surroundings carefully, to have suitable separations in time and space scales, not because of a universal tendency to heat death. Choose an unsuitable system and surroundings, and thermodynamics won't work for it.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 11:04, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

:::What is wrong? [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 23:53, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

:::Dear Dauto, thank you for this. It depends what kind of thermodynamics one means. Thermodynamics as understood by present day scientists is not all powerful, that is to say, it does not work for any choice of system and surroundings. Potentially, in the future, it might turn out that thermodynamics will be of wider applicability. The usual versions of thermodynamics, for example, suppose that the system contains so many molecules that surface effects do not matter; you can check this in any reasonable beginning textbook. What one might call 'quasi-static thermodynamics' supposes that the local entropy density is a function of the usual local state variables, and that the global entropy can be found by assuming that the local entropy density can be integrated over volume as if it were an extensive variable like mass. The comments that I just deleted were about predicting the cosmological future of the entire universe, saying that such prediction is a grandiose program, and that carrying it out would require information not currently known, and in particular that it would require something like a calculation of the entropy of the entire universe, a calculation that lies more in the realm of grandiose fantasy than within the scope of feasible classical thermodyanamics. I made a mistake in raising this topic here and that is why I deleted the comment; I do not think further discussion of this matter is likely to be useful here and now.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 02:18, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

== Experimentally Reproducible? ==

The second paragraph of this article troubles me for several reasons. At very least it needs to be more clear. Here are my concerns:

1. "Thermodynamics concerns phenomena that are experimentally reproducible." While this is a true statement, it can also be applied to any other branch of science. I am not sure why it is here, and the rest of the paragraph does little to answer the question. 

2. "For example, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is a steady state reached after a system has aged so that it no longer changes with the passage of time." Again, this is technically true, but very confusing. It is not the age of the system that is important, but the equilibrium. Equilibrium is mentioned in the next sentence, but again, not clearly. My understanding of equilibrium is not that it does not change, but that any change is countered by an equal but opposite change, statistically speaking. E.g. when a body of water in a closed system (at STP), some water molecules are always evaporating, but other molecules are condensing at an equivalent rate; thus the proportions of liquid and gaseous water remain constant. If the system is assembled in equilibrium proportions, no "aging" is necessary. I believe the same is true of heat transfer.

3. The third sentence is nearly unintelligible. I think it means that the equilibrium conditions are somehow dependent on initial conditions. I'm not sure that this is quite right.

4. The fourth sentence returns to reproducibility. As I pointed out earlier, this term is usually associated with a concept at the core of the philosophy of science. I think the author meant to use a different term that refers to the return to equilibrium.

5. "This [reproducibility] is the source of the strengths and the weaknesses of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics does not deal with phenomena that are not experimentally reproducible." These two sentences do little to clarify what comes before. We might suppose that thermodynamics is limited to equilibrium systems, but I'm not sure 'weakness' is the right word to use here. The last sentence is completely useless. No science deals with phenomena that are not reproducible to at least some degree (the historical sciences -- paleontology, archeology -- are a dubious exception), so this trait cannot make thermo any "stronger" or "weaker" than any other science. besides, these terms are value judgments and thus probably inappropriate in this context.

Overall, this paragraph is unclear and possibly misguided. Perhaps the author was striking at a deep idea, but it hasn't come across, and it does not function well to introduce the topic of thermo. In that case, it belongs in a later section.

I suspect that this whole paragraph can be replaced with something like, "Thermodynamics deals with predictions of the equilibrium states of a system. It does not predict the manner in which the system changes toward equilibrium. Equilibrium is the state of a system in which, absent any external forces or external energy transfers, a change in the system is countered by an equal but opposite change, so that the system appears to be static."

:I agree with your criticism and suggest that you go ahead and make a revision.  Perhaps some others will join in and help.[[User:Phmoreno|Phmoreno]] ([[User talk:Phmoreno|talk]]) 14:23, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

:Dear Cladist, thank you for your commentary. May I reply? Dear Phmoreno, you agree with Cladist so my reply to Cladist may be addressed to you also.

:Many inferences are drawn from the apparently entirely general nature of thermodynamics, but it is necessary to be clear about just how far that generality extends. The unwary novice needs to be warned of this right from the start.

::::::::::1. "Thermodynamics concerns phenomena that are experimentally reproducible." While this is a true statement, it can also be applied to any other branch of science. I am not sure why it is here, and the rest of the paragraph does little to answer the question.

:Many branches of science are concerned with phenomena that are not experimentally reproducible. For example, the earth, so far as is currently known, has no identically prepared copy (identicality here meaning identicality as defined in thermodynamic terms), and many aspects of its evolution are not experimentally reproducible. We have no strong reason to know that if the earth were prepared in an originally identical copy, all aspects of its evolution would be the same as those that have actually occurred. That is the meaning of the theory of evolution, that the specific evolution of species occurred through unpredictable or chance processes; this is usually considered to be a scientific subject. Thermodynamics does not attempt to provide specific predictions of the evolution of species. The diverse evolutions of particular individual galaxies are evidently very variable, and so astronomy is also a branch of science that deals with phenomena that are in some respects not experimentally reproducible. But some of the phenomena of astronomy are reproduced in nature, and they are the concern of thermodynamics. If you wish to be very particular about whether astronomy is an 'experimental' science, you can say that a typical astronomical experiment is to turn a telescope in a particular direction at a particular time and take a photograph with it. The turning of the telescope is the way of preparation. The content of the photograph is a record of the result of the experiment.

:That the rest of the paragraph does little to answer the question you raise is a consequence of the short compass of the lead. But the general point still needs to be made at the start. The lead does not attempt to answer the question of how and why heat and work are distinguished, but it still needs to make the point that thermodynamics is about the distinction between them. In fact, the article does not do a good job explaining how and why they are distinct, and this needs remedy, but probably not in the lead. The lead raises issues, but does not usually settle them.

:The reason why you are unsure about why this paragraph is here is that you presuppose that all branches of science deal only with reproducible phenomena. Perhaps you might like to reconsider that presupposition.

::::::::::2. "For example, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is a steady state reached after a system has aged so that it no longer changes with the passage of time." Again, this is technically true, but very confusing. It is not the age of the system that is important, but the equilibrium. Equilibrium is mentioned in the next sentence, but again, not clearly. My understanding of equilibrium is not that it does not change, but that any change is countered by an equal but opposite change, statistically speaking. E.g. when a body of water in a closed system (at STP), some water molecules are always evaporating, but other molecules are condensing at an equivalent rate; thus the proportions of liquid and gaseous water remain constant. If the system is assembled in equilibrium proportions, no "aging" is necessary. I believe the same is true of heat transfer.

:Many texts speak of the aging of a system as a way of its reaching equilibrium. We agree that the statement is technically true. But you are concerned that it puts a wrong emphasis on age rather than on equilibrium. The next sentence agrees with your concern that it is not just age that matters; it intends to put the focus on what really matters, that, for a system defined by its way of preparation, the equilibrium reached must be the same every time. This is one of the fundamental presuppositions of thermodynamics, though perhaps it is taken by experts to be so obvious as not to need stating. But this article is for a wider audience, and they may not have that presupposition, essential though it is for thermodynamics.

:You now express concern about the third sentence, which reads: "But more than that, for thermodynamics, a system, defined by its being prepared in a certain way must, on every particular occasion of preparation, upon aging, reach one and the same eventual state of thermodynamic equilibrium, entirely determined by the way of preparation." You find this third sentence unclear. If it continues to be unclear, then it will need to be re-written to make it clear.

:You now tell us about your understanding of equilibrium: "My understanding of equilibrium is not that it does not change, but that any change is countered by an equal but opposite change, statistically speaking. E.g. when a body of water in a closed system (at STP), some water molecules are always evaporating, but other molecules are condensing at an equivalent rate; thus the proportions of liquid and gaseous water remain constant. If the system is assembled in equilibrium proportions, no "aging" is necessary. I believe the same is true of heat transfer." You are here telling us not about thermodynamics in general, but about the statistical thermodynamical explanation of macroscopic thermodynamics. But you are not telling us any reason why you think that the sentence about which you are concerned is wrong.

::::::::::3. The third sentence is nearly unintelligible. I think it means that the equilibrium conditions are somehow dependent on initial conditions. I'm not sure that this is quite right.

:You say that you find this sentence nearly unintelligible. You think it means that the equilibrium conditions are somehow dependent on initial conditions. You are not sure that this is quite right. Surely if a system is "defined by its being prepared in a certain way", then, in general, the eventual equilibrium that it reaches must depend on the way of its preparation? You write of "initial conditions" but the sentence is not framed in such terms: it is about the way of preparation. You are reading into the sentence a presupposition of your own, so that for you the sentence does not mean what it says. You are reading into it the presupposition that in some respects the system is prepared in a single definite way, but in other respects it is prepared in various ways, which you presuppose as various "initial conditions" applied to the aforesaid single definite way, "initial conditions" that may or may not affect the eventual equilibrium reached. For this reading, the sentence means that the single definite way affects the eventual equilibrium state, though perhaps the various "initial conditions" might not.

::::::::::4. The fourth sentence returns to reproducibility. As I pointed out earlier, this term is usually associated with a concept at the core of the philosophy of science. I think the author meant to use a different term that refers to the return to equilibrium.

:You think that reproducibility is usually associated with a concept at the core of the philosophy of science. Do you really mean to exclude unpredictable fluctuations from the purview of science? The fourth sentence reads: "The meanings of the terms used in this statement are clarified in the following, but experimental reproducibility is a primary and fundamental requirement for thermodynamics." It is not clear what you mean by "return to equilibrium" or why you mention it here.

::::::::::5. "This [reproducibility] is the source of the strengths and the weaknesses of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics does not deal with phenomena that are not experimentally reproducible." These two sentences do little to clarify what comes before. We might suppose that thermodynamics is limited to equilibrium systems, but I'm not sure 'weakness' is the right word to use here. The last sentence is completely useless. No science deals with phenomena that are not reproducible to at least some degree (the historical sciences -- paleontology, archeology -- are a dubious exception), so this trait cannot make thermo any "stronger" or "weaker" than any other science. besides, these terms are value judgments and thus probably inappropriate in this context.

:You write that "we might suppose that thermodynamics is limited to equilibrium systems". Some might suppose that, but not all. You write that you are not sure that 'weakness' is the right word to use here. Thermodynamics is not good at dealing with non-equilibrium systems, especially those far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Surely this is a weakness? The difficulty is that, in general, the evolution of physical systems is not necessarily experimentally reproducible; non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with recognizing the cases of experimentally reproducible evolution of physical systems. People are trying hard to do something about this weakness. Are they wasting their time, do you think? Thermodynamics is good at dealing with equilibrium systems. Surely this is a strength? You write that the last sentence is completely useless, and that no science deals with phenomena that are not reproducible to as least some degree with the possible exception of "the historical sciences". Radio-carbon dating is an example. Insofar as it is true that there is some element of reproducibility in "the historical sciences", just so far and no further are they a concern of thermodynamics. You write: "besides, these terms are value judgments and thus probably inappropriate in this context". Is it really inappropriate to point out that a subject is successful in some of its aims but not yet in others? Why?

::::::::::Overall, this paragraph is unclear and possibly misguided. Perhaps the author was striking at a deep idea, but it hasn't come across, and it does not function well to introduce the topic of thermo. In that case, it belongs in a later section.

:Why do you say that this paragraph is "possibly misguided"?

:The reason that you find the paragraph unclear is that it presupposes something that you disagree with, and that consequently is not in your way of thinking. It presupposes that some sciences deal with phenomena that are not experimentally reproducible. But it says that thermodynamics is not one of them. While you agree that thermodynamics is not a science that deals with phenomena that are not experimentally reproducible, apparently you seem to presuppose that no such sciences exist. Perhaps you might like to reconsider that presupposition.

:The key to the idea of entropy is that it refers to experimental reproducibility. Entropy is one of the key ideas of thermodynamics, perhaps the main key idea. Without entropy and heat, one is dealing not with thermodynamics, but with energetics. Entropy cannot be easily discussed in the lead, but experimental reproducibility is, as you rightly say, an important notion in science, and is widely recognized to be so, and it is important for thermodynamics because entropy is important for thermodynamics. This is so important that it deserves a place in the lead.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 15:26, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

::Rather than give a detailed answer to each point, I just want to say that I agree with Chjoaygame that equilibrium in thermodynamics is characterized by lack of change. The idea that this lack of change is "apparent" since there is a balance in two competing changes on the microscopic level is not classical thermodynamics, it is statistical mechanics, an explanation of the lack of change in classical thermodynamics. I disagree with Chjoaygame that science need not be about repeatable experiments. Experimental repeatability is absolutely fundamental to all science. Just because we have no duplicate of Earth does not mean we can form no scientific theory of the Earth. Carbon-14 dating of a rock is a repeatable experiment which tells the age of that rock, and inferences can be drawn about the age of the Earth from that. If we can divide a system into smaller subsystems which we can then perform repeatable experiments upon, then we are doing science.

::Why can't we reword some of this, such as: "Thermodynamic equilibrium implies that the driving force, such as temperature or concentraion difference or chemical reaction potential, that originally existed, has become exhausted."  Also, examples of reproducible experiments should be cited, such as steam tables, enthalpy data, chet capacity data, etc.

:::Replying to PAR, Dear Par, thank you for this. It seems we agree that experimental reproducibility is fundamental to thermodynamics. That is what the paragraph asserts. More precisely the paragraph writes of experimentally reproducible phenomena. Though you write of "repeatable experiments", for your remarks to be quite relevant here, they will have to be read as meaning that you think that all science is about experimentally reproducible phenomena. The relevance of this would be that if it were true, it would be sufficient to say that thermodynamics was a science, without the need to explicitly emphasise its concern with reproducibility of phenomena. It is true that we can form a scientific theory of the Earth; but this is not to say that a duplicately (in the sense of thermodynamic duplication) prepared earth would lead to the same evolutionary outcome that we have found in the present earth. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is about phenomena that are experimentally reproducible in the sense that thermodynamically duplicately prepared systems evolve to reproducible eventual states. In studying the scientific facts about the earth, we are interested also in the phenomena that are not experimentally reproducible. For example, we are concerned to sustain biodiversity by care of the environment because we think that we could not experimentally reproduce the evolution of species that might be destroyed by environmental destruction. It is perfectly scientific to think so. Therefore I ask you to reconsider your apparent view that all science is about experimentally reproducible phenomena.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 18:53, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

::::There is [[hard and soft science]]. The less a scientific discipline is able to organize its knowledge mathematically in terms of repeatable experiments and basic principles, the "softer" it is, and the less certain we are about its conclusions. The idea that we cannot reproduce the evolution of species is very soft science, it is not something you can prove mathematically from basic principles, so I would dispute the statement that it is perfectly scientific to think so. Thermodynamics is "hard" science, and I see no problem in making that clear in this article. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 21:09, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

:I wish to make just a few remarks. If you qualify thermodynamics as being experimentally reproducible, you imply that at least one other scientific theory isn't. This is false. Also, I wish to correct a common error defining 'equilibrium'. Your static condition is part of a sufficient definition (that can't be expressed in an operational manner). Systems that equilibrate system and environment 'more rapidly' than the environment is changing are in equilibrium. I can't phrase this well; but it's in Enrico Fermi's slim volume (lecture notes), 'Thermodynamics'. Geologist have good results with equilibrium thermodynamics, even with magmas that are erupting. Also, I dislike 'driving force', for it implies the value of the characteristic function at equilibrium is somehow known by the system in advance. I also dislike 'reproducible', for it suggests to novices that the path is reversed, not the states. Duhem, Bridgman, and others have suggested other terms, but none are good. Better to refer to the most efficient change of state. [[Special:Contributions/209.218.108.23|209.218.108.23]] ([[User talk:209.218.108.23|talk]]) 21:27, 22 September 2011 (UTC) (Geologist)

:There are some vague statements about 'reversibility' being fundamental to science. This is an interesting thought. Has anyone a counter example other than quantum phenomena? A phenomenon is a change in quantity or quality, either measurable or observable. We in geology test a proposition by finding rocks with the initial observations, then seeing whether the prediction of change is present. We use such a proposition backward, to predict the 'cause' from the 'effect'. Reversibility may fail for quantum phenomena, but if an effect can have only one cause, the proposition proves to be useful. Axiomatic theories are possible even in geology. Walter Bucher wrote one about mountain building in the early 20th Century, and it's still valid (even after the theory of Plate Tectonics).

== Equilibrium systems are homogeneous? ==

I doubt this. If I have a sphere half full of water, the rest air, at room temperature, what does the equilibrium state look like? Assume the center of mass is at the center of the sphere. I think it will be a sphere of water, centered at the center of the container, surrounded by air that is saturated with water vapor, assuming no interaction between the walls of the sphere and the water. 

Does every part of a system have to be diathermically connected to some other part? Why can't I have a system consisting of two containers of gas, each at equilibrium, each at different temperatures, adiabatically isolated from each other? By the definition of equilibrium, the state does not change in time, so such a system is in equilibrium. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 03:14, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

:Dear PAR, good point. The phases of equilibrium systems in the classical picture are homogeneous, but you are right, one can have a system that consists of multiple phases, and that system is, of course, not homogeneous. Accordingly, I have put in a note about phases.

:As for a system consisting of two containers of gas, [each at its own isolated private equilibrium,] each at different temperatures, adiabatically isolated from each other: Yes, if you like to speak of compound systems with internal adiabatically isolating barriers, and you keep the barriers in place, and the temperatures are different, you can say that the system is in equilibrium, provided you remember to say that the barriers must be maintained. Rather than speaking of a system with internal barriers, it seems to me more natural to say that one has several systems. It creates complications for saying things, unnecessary complications as I see it, to speak of systems with maintained internal isolating barriers. The key physics here is that the elementary basic states of thermodynamics are homogeneous. Just how you like to talk about compound systems with phases and barriers is the kind of thing that can create endless complications, which you may or may not fancy. Planck, Guggenheim, and Prigogine and Defay work with systems having multiple phases, but in general not having internal isolating barriers, and I am happy to follow them in this.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 08:59, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

::Yes, I don't have the book handy, but I believe Guggenheim makes a distinction between a general system with possibly adiabatic barriers, and a "standard system" without them. If you have the book, can you check that out? [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 17:14, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

:::Dear PAR, Guggenheim's last edition (fifth, 1967, apart from a paperback published in 1985 after his death with the same content) on pages 6 and 7 writes: "To sum up, the complete description of the thermodynamic state of any system involves a description of the thermodynamic state of each of its homogeneous phases, which may be few or infinite in number." No mention of partitions or barriers. No mention of a "standard system" here. Elsewhere he talks about 'standard pressures' and so on. Fermi writes on page 3: "In order to define the state of a non-homogeneous system, one must be able to divide it into a number of homogeneous parts." No mention of partitions. Prigogine and Defay write in italics on page 1: "'By definition a phase is homogeneous or uniform throughout its extent.'" No mention of partitions. Glansdorff and Prigogine do not mention partitions. De Groot and Mazur do not mention partitions. In discussing osmosis and separation of components by use of semipermeable membranes various writers use the concept of a membrane within the system and such systems are not homogeneous but the membranes are not really isolating partitions. I vaguely recall a book about living cell thermodynamics that had its own different definition of 'phase'. Callen, discussing the vexed term 'entropy of mixing', uses a piston-like sliding semipermeable partition and a fixed partition; I don't think he gets the physics right even so: mixing two previously separated substances will have them perhaps show colligative effects, but they are colligative effects, not simply mixing effects, I think; I don't think Callen quite cottons on to this; his use of partitions doesn't get him home. Other writers about the 'entropy of mixing' also use partitions. Callen also talks about 'coupled systems' driven by pistons linked by lever arms. The machines of Carnot are in a sense 'systems' far from homogeneous, but for Carnot, the cyclic process approach exempts him from a detailed account of the 'working substance' and its machinations. Both Guggenheim (page 6) and Sommerfeld (page 3) cunningly start their remarks on such matters by referring to the the "simplest example", and talk immediately about homogeneous systems; cunningly, they don't tell us about systems that are not simple examples. I think that just how you like to talk about compound systems with phases and barriers is the kind of thing that can create endless complications, which you may or may not fancy. I don't think the Wikipedia can easily be cleverer than Guggenheim and Sommerfeld and Fermi and Prigogine.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 21:51, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

And on page 175 about Joule-Thomson expansion in terms of two large enclosures. And on page 176 about mixing in terms of separate compartments of a diathermal enclosure. Though he has set up a terminology of 'standard' and 'non-standard' systems, other writers do not so far as I have noticed use these terms 'standard' and 'non-standard' for systems. It seems he feels the need to explicitly notify the reader when he is referring to a compound system, and does not take 'system' by default in general to be compound.

::::Equilibrium occurs when all parts of a system have communicated as rapidly as the environment is changing. Examine the subject of osmotic pressure. You start with a system homogeneous in pressure, not at equilibrium. When equilibrium is attained, the semi-permeable membrane down the center has allowed water to cross, increasing the pressure greatly in one partition, decreasing it in the other. Why should an adiabatic, flexible barrier not be similar?

:::::'''Response to Geologist's question''': "Is homogeneity, even of intensities only, needed for equilibrium?" According to the usual suspects, in the absence of an externally imposed force field such as gravity, a simple isolated system of a single phase in thermodynamic equilibrium is homogeneous. In the presence of an externally imposed force field such as gravity, the matter will tend more or less to sink to the bottom, as noted by Aristotle. Accordingly the density and so forth are not homogeneous. But the temperature will be uniform.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 07:27, 29 September 2011 (UTC)

::::::Unfortunately, in this example, the phase (immersed in a saturated solution) will probably dissolve at the bottom (where the stress is greater), and precipitate on the top (where it is not). Hence the system is not in equilibrium either; and it doesn't use purely internal energy, which most texts like. We can find a good example anyway:--

::::::Most of your 'usual suspects' are likely chemists. If you pick up a rock, the only homogeneous phase visible is likely quartz. When a mineral is compositionally zoned, the inner part of a zone was probably metastable (or even unstable) at the time of crystallization. Once this 'nucleus' is present, the mineral changes composition as it grows until it reaches a stable equilibrium, when it pauses. Geologists use composition-measuring microscopes to capture this stable composition and calculate the temperature and pressure of an assemblage of such compositions, or of a hand specimen of rock. This stable zone (but not the phase, or even crystal) is homogeneous in your suspects' sense, so osmotic equilibrium presents a better example.

I would say that your interest seems directed to questions of how to define a simple or compound system and a phase and a component.

Consequently, despite the Zeroth Law's apparently confusing you, uniformity of temperature is not needed for equilibrium ..if.. there is an adiabatic wall present.

Under 'Treatment of Equilibrium', the article reads:

'Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium; for they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. For their thermodynamic study, more general concepts are required for non-equilibrium systems than for equilibrium systems.'

Geologists do just fine with equilibrium thermodynamics. They apply it to metamorphic and igneous rocks the size of a hand specimen. I don't expect this statement changed. Many geologists, too, consider texts & treatises to be written by divinities. They have the problem that the earth, from its deepest samples to a sample bottle in an estuary, demonstrates consistent results that would satisfy any scientist as proof of equilibrium. Rats! How can that be?

Geologists who have not carefully studied Fermi explain this by a failure to attain equilbrium, but an inability to measure a deviation from it. (This is in the fine print in [[geothermobarometry]]. Just ignore the ancient folklore there of minerals having to be in contact.) This failure to attain equilibrium is, of course, Bridgman's definition of equilibrium itself; but philosophers of science roll their eyes at such a concept. Still, rocks change their compositions with position and with time, but rarely fast enough for equilibrium to fail and keep up. Most triggers (metastable states) have already been set off (earthquakes are nearly continuous) for both continuous and discontinuous changes in state. The study of crystals in magmas (where no shear waves contributed to triggers) allow stable equilibrium states to be identified.

Spacial and temporal deviations are not really extant in the laboratory, especially when the footfalls of students are permitted; so chemists and physicists don't really work with systems the size or age of a mountain. If they did, equilibrium might have been defined differently. I suggest what you will likely do: keep it wrong until a different definition reaches reputable treatises. However, your conclusion implies that equilibrium thermodynamics is not very useful in geology, which is certainly wrong; and I'm not sure what to do about this logical conclusion.

All non-equilibrium thermodynamics come with deep problems of their own, since the concept of temperature assumes equilibrium. Applying them rather than equilibrium thermodynamics to the earth would not guarantee better results.

Oh, I found a statement in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] that similar to Fermi's classical definition, but draws from a different theory of thermodynamics (mixing two or three theories):

'Local thermodynamic equilibrium does not require either local or global stationarity. In other words, each small locality need not have a constant temperature. However, it does require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain its local Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities.'

===An Equilibrium Equivalent to minimizing the Characteristic Function===

Abstract to concrete classical thermodynamics define equilibrium as states that minimize a characteristic function (Prigogine & Defay). A large body of consistent pressures & temperatures suggests this works for geologists; and these concrete to abstract definitions of equilibrium do have an equivalent, on page 4 of E. Fermi's 1936 Thermodynamics by Prentice-Hall in NJ: [States of equilibrium] have the property of not varying so long as the external conditions remain unchanged.
...
'A reversible transformation can be realized in practice by changing the external conditions so slowly that the system has time to adjust itself gradually to the altered conditions.'

== Thermodynamics is a simple subject ==

Classical thermodynamics, as presented in universities, is really a simple subject: work degrades to heat. Examined logically, the subject is fundamentally confounding (as presented in P.W. Bridgman's works). Its two laws and such concepts as 'temperature', needed to define heat, require equilibrium. This is why axiomatic presentations assume equilibrium.

The term 'adiabatic', BTW, does not imply rigid. This comprehensive presentation needs to be edited heavily by a physicist or physical chemist. It merely alludes to thermodynamics, mixing elementary and advanced concepts, often the same sentence. Almost always, facts presented are wrong. I truly don't mean to be cruel: great effort was taken in writing this; and a good re-write can draw from its topics. Thermodynamics can appear very confusing in texts that focus more on its successful application than concepts. Prigogine & Defay, for example, state the phase rule is applicable to open or closed systems, while the eminent Glasstone states closed only. (P&D are correct.)

The article is of such great importance that it needs to be written by a fine physics professor, one who has spent his career presenting it simply to students. (I am only a retired geologist.)

:Perhaps, dear Geologist, since you find thermodynamics simple, and seem familiar with Prigogine and Defay, you will be very kind, and, in intuitively understandable terms, for our education, gently clarify for us Chapter XVII especially Section 3 of that textbook? My particular puzzlement is with the sentence: "However, if the mixture is rich in nitrogen (...) then the addition of a little more nitrogen is followed by a further dissociation of ammonia to form more nitrogen and oxygen." While I am not doubting its truth, I have to admit that this does not feel intuitive to me; perhaps you will be so very kind as to explain it so as to make it feel intuitive to me.

Sorry about the confusion. I assumed the article was to cover fundamentals. Notice I wrote: 'Thermodynamics can appear very confusing in texts that focus more on its successful application than concepts.' I've neither my library or computers, but your question emphasizes this statement.

As in dynamics, thermodynamic objects appear to resist being jostled about. Hence, if a chemical mixture can react, it will do so to ameliorate a perturbation of its thermodynamic quantities. Adding nitrogen will increase its escaping tendency (fugacity) if no reactions take place. If it can react, it will do so to reduce this increase. In cases of reacting gasses, single or multiple reactions can greatly increase or decrease pressure and concentration. In your case 'if rich in nitrogen' suggests the chemical compounds (which comprise the mechanisms of change accessible to the system - the reactions) change with bulk composition. To be quick, in cases such as yours, although the amount of nitrogen increases, the amounts of other gasses may increase more: this (ignoring pressure), reduces the reaction-free increase in concentration and escaping tendency of nitrogen, as the Le Chatelier-Braun Principle predicts. If not, examine the pressure change (though changes in pressure and composition are highly correlated in gasses).

The above assumes equilibrium and has something to do with the second law, though you have me there. Derivations are difficult. That's why I claim thermodynamics (without too much analysis) is simple; it's applying it that's hard. However, I found the article very complicated and jargon-riddled.

Apologies again, but I've neither my computers nor password book, but I'm registered as 'Geologist'. If you wish to discuss your question further, my e-mail is in my personal data on the Apple Boards under 'Bruce Bathurst'. (I seldom use handles except on sites where I anticipated being hated. :-)

:Thank you Geologist. As I interpret what you write, you seem to have a statement of the LeChâtelier-Braun principle different from Prigogine and Defay's. It seems that the exact wording of the principle matters. You find Prigogine and Defay here to be very complicated and jargon-riddled. It seems to me that a responsive increase in the amount of nitrogen would increase its fugacity at constant volume, but they here refer to a process at constant temperature and pressure (first paragraph of section 3). In effect, you are saying that at constant temperature and pressure with a nitrogen-rich mixture, the response to the perturbation will be an increase in volume that will reduce the concentration of nitrogen so as to partly negate the perturbational increase in nitrogen concentration, even though the amount of nitrogen has increased; the newly produced hydrogen will dilute the nitrogen. Thus you are defining the perturbation as a perturbation of fugacity, while Prigogine and Defay define it as a perturbation of amount of nitrogen (their words are "number of moles"). They comment: "Many workers have attempted to state the principle in completely general form; but this form, if it exists, is necessarily very complex." They also comment that "Analogous considerations apply ... at constant volume." It calls for very careful statements.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 17:24, 23 September 2011 (UTC)

As I said, I'm sorry not to have any books with me. 'I found the article very complicated and jargon-riddled.' refers to the Wikipedia article. You asked for a clarification, not a rigorous explanation (which you have), and you didn't specify the nature of the walls that contained your gas (hence I chose closed, rigid, and adiabatic, to ease the explanation). Your misquotes of me mix 'walls', or partial derivatives. 

Any consistent coordinate system is easily converted into Progogine & Defay's definition, though they aren't gods: different natural sciences have need for the Le Chatelier-Braun principle in different variables. If it were valid only for your variables, it would be an empirical approximation, not a scientific theorem. P&G would, I believe, agree. 

Just for those interested, the crux of the solution is likely the change in reactions accessible to the system at high nitrogen compositions.

I oppose trolling, so you are quite free to misquote me again. My comments were completed earlier, though I feel I could have been a bit harsh about the errors in the article.

:I think it would be easier if you had the text with you. The matter is too complicated to work on by guess and remote control. They are not "my" variables; they are Prigogine and Defay's.

:I think that you do indeed have a different, and perhaps better, statement of the principle than the one that Prigogine and Defay use. They say explicitly that their principle has exceptions and that this is one of them; it is a large part of the message of their Chapter. Prigogine and Defay comment that they do not know how to state the principle in an exceptionless way. It seems your principle may be exceptionless, though that is a statement that I do not feel I have enough understanding to form a judgement about.

My own feeling at the time I wrote and after I wrote my response to your answer to my question was "Thank God we have someone here who really knows what he is talking about, and gave a very good answer to my question, though it was a bit careless of him not to bother to look at Chapter XVII before answering.

If editor Geologist (aka Bruce Bathurst) is still reading this page, he might like to observe that there is, as far as I can find, no mention of thermodynamics in the Wikipedia article on [[Geology]]. Perhaps someone might do something about that.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 07:44, 27 September 2011 (UTC)

I'm back. I've Prigogine & Defay in my hand; and I realize I misled you. Glancing at the following chapter, P&D appears to be referring to an open system here. Section 3 makes this clear in its introduction and ends with the puzzling equation 17.25.

Le Chatelier's and van't Hoff's principles correlate extensive variables with their intensive conjugates (volume & pressure; entropy & temperature, respectively). Quantity of substance is correlated with chemical escaping tendency; but if the system is open, there is no correlation at all. In the case of walls that are open to nitrogen, pushing nitrogen through one side will push an equilibrium mixture out the other.

I think 17.25 is simpler if both sides are inverted, so x(i) lt v(i)/v. Now we can see that, if adding nitrogen uses it to create NH3 (the bulk compositions shifts toward NH3), the system behaves as intuition suggests; but if adding nitrogen causes NH3 to decompose and produce H2 (the bulk composition shifts away from NH3), N2 will also be produced. A binary phase diagram N2-H2 should clarify this. P&D is filled with phase diagrams, but I can't find a good example.

Also, I don't pretend to be comfortable with the above explanation (after one reading). I should read the references (which are always easier), and try some examples using gas mixtures you're familiar with.

However, I hope this correction helps some: the question confused me until I realized the system was open. P&G doesn't offer a nice explanation in anything but symbols. :-( My best,

[[User:Bruce Bathurst|Geologist]] ([[User talk:Bruce Bathurst|talk]]) 22:15, 2 October 2011 (UTC)

:Thank you for this, Geologist. Yes, indeed P&D say they are referring to an open system; I didn't go into such detail before, for more or less obvious reasons. I suppose it must make a difference, but I am not clear what kind of walls and open system they refer to, and what they intend for its surroundings. I have not chased up the references.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 04:03, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

This is true. Another simple subject is the board game 'Go', with two colors of stone and a single rule. Yet mastering its application to games takes decades. I suspect no texts have more errors than those of thermodynamics. (I've not found one in P&D.) Long ago, some friends taught me to return to the original discovery, which must explain the topic clearly to have convinced the reviewers. (BTW, those references are mainly Dutch, I believe, published in French.)

If you're happy with a vague explanation, try this: In closed systems, two reactions (assuming O2) can proceed in such relative amounts that both drop the characteristic potential (by reactions) and increase the amount of nitrogen. Opening a system to a composition adds another tool to its box of tricks, allowing the system to both drop the characteristic potential (by single reaction and diffusion) and increase the amount of nitrogen. (That might explain why P&D's treatment had to be so terse as to fit in only two chapters!-) [[User:Bruce Bathurst|Geologist]] ([[User talk:Bruce Bathurst|talk]]) 20:34, 3 October 2011 (UTC)

== Removed erroneous conclusion ==

<blockquote>According to [[Herbert Callen]]'s widely cited 1985 text on thermodynamics: "An essential prerequisite for the measurability of energy is the existence of walls that do not permit transfer of energy in the form of heat." This makes the recognition of heat and temperature a necessary presupposition for the proper statement of an empirically testable principle of conservation of energy.. </blockquote>

I have removed the second sentence which is an erroneous conclusion. What Callen meant was that the existence of walls that do not permit the transfer of energy are fundamental, and do not require the concepts of heat or temperature, or entropy, in order to be used. If this were not the case, then there would be circular reasoning. You would need to define heat and temperature in order to state the first law, which then defines heat, which then lays the groundwork for the second law which defines temperature. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 00:57, 28 September 2011 (UTC)

:What is this talk about circular reasoning? The notion of walls that do not permit the transfer of energy requires the concept of energy. The concept of energy is built on a notion of conservation, and if you assume the conservation of energy, then it becomes nonsense to try to verify it experimentally, which Callen does by use of the concept of state. Callen's definition of state in his Postulate 1 on page contains the variable the internal energy. This is a "non-deformation coordinate" and satisfies the definition of an empirical temperature under the conditions used. I will content myself with quoting the two sentences of Callen just previous to the one that is quoted in the article: "In order that this energy function be meaningful in a practical sense, however, we must convince ourselves that it is macroscopically controllable and measurable. We shall now show that practical methods of measurement of the energy do exist, and in doing so we shall be led to a quantitative operational definition of heat." He then argues in physical terms with the use of the concept of heat, though not measured on an absolute scale. He says further on "The existence of these several types of walls [diathermal and adiabatic] resolves the first of our concerns with the thermodynamic energy. That is, these walls demonstrate that energy is macroscopically controllable. It can be trapped by restrictive walls and manipulated by diathermal walls." How can you distinguish diathermal from adiabatic walls without recognizing heat and empirical temperature and without assuming the law of conservation of energy? You are misrepresenting Callen on this point. In effect, you are calling Planck a silly old fool.

:PAR, by imposing, by force of overwriting, the doctrine that comes from your point of view, you may get a feeling of satisfaction, and perhaps approbation from your fellow believers, but this is not science, and I do not have time to struggle with it.

:I've no books, but I shall quote you:

:'According to Herbert Callen's widely cited 1985 text on thermodynamics: "An essential prerequisite for the measurability of energy is the existence of walls that do not permit transfer of energy in the form of heat." This makes the recognition of heat and temperature a necessary presupposition for the proper statement of an empirically testable principle of conservation of energy... .'

:Axiomatic presentations are composed of axioms and primitive definitions that one assumes are true. Logic them develops these. However, I'm a operationalist, so I like a little more.

:The essence of your question is: Can one find an adiabatic wall without having a way of measuring heat? Imagine a balloon made of different substances, each permitting heat to pass to varying degrees. Let the environment change (lowering & increasing its pressure), so the balloon expands and contracts. That balloon which expands most is closest to adiabatic. (In your language, work that produces heat in the balloon can't escape, and enlarges the balloon as temperature and pressure return to their initial values (lots of tiny system tossed throughout the environment are again identical, defining a cycle.) Drawing graphs, we might even be able to define 'adiabatic' as a limit.

:The above has the advantage of defining work as well, given the mechanical properties of the balloon. Ordinary, closed balloons with change in size and warmth during the cycle, so there exists thermodynamics quantities that form a potential: they return to their initial state(s) as the environment makes a cycle. A clever person will note that we can, if we choose, invent 'heat', which when summed with work, is a potential. One can also integrate Joseph Black's specific heats over relative temperature changes to calculate heat independently. But this isn't necessary. This derives the first law of thermodynamics from a system surrounded by an adiabatic, closed wall only, not necessarily from concepts of heat or temperature.

:The above is awkward, for I haven't Callen with me, but it illustrates that walls suffice to express the laws of thermodynamics. Heat & work are a more historical alternative, but we use Black's integration to calculate heat flow from a temperature difference (and heat flux can't be separated into radiation and conduction, as done in one draft of the article). So, axiomatic presentations can become circular very easily.

:(My personal axiomatization uses volume change and thermometers, not walls. This permits me to eliminate the 'Zeroth Law' by blending it into the definition of temperature. Also, you should eliminate the 'Third Law' from the article. However, PAR, I believe, is correct here.)

:PS. I missed the part where PAR calls Max Planck a 'silly, old fool'.

Chjoaygame, I have called in the "old boy" network only once, and that was because you made the statement that the first law is not about conservation of energy, which is flat wrong, and I was not willing to allow such a blatantly incorrect statement to exist on that page while we discussed the matter. Many of those "old boys" I do not recognize, some I do recognize and have had conflicts with in the past, and some of those conflicts I did not win. So please do not think that there is some kind of mindless gang of robots running around reverting edits that do not agree with their unexamined dogma. The thing about this gang is that they usually resolve disputes by reasoned arguments, rather that trying to beat each other to death with quotes from famous people that they do not understand.

I am more than willing to rationally discuss this with you, but please do not tell me I am wrong because I disagree with some famous person. If that famous person was correct, then there is a reasoned argument that proves that I am wrong. Please give me that reasoned argument. My philosophy is that of Buddha:

<blockquote>Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense - Siddhartha Gautama Buddha -</blockquote>

If your response is to request a reference for that quote, or to point out that it is not a correct translation, or that Buddha is not a reliable authority, then you have missed the point entirely, and we have nothing more to discuss.

You say: "The notion of walls that do not permit the transfer of energy requires the concept of energy." True, but the fundamental notion is not that they do not permit the transfer of energy, but rather that two systems on either side of the adiabatic wall do not equilibrate. Equilibration, thermal contact and thermal isolation are fundamental concepts. Bruce Bathurst has given a very good example, and we should study it, rather that searching for quote from some book which seems to contradict it. If his argument has flaws, then we point out the flaws. I admit that the process of precisely defining equilibrium, thermal isolation and connection in terms of measurements which do not use the concepts of energy, temperature, entropy, etc. is not wholly clear to me and I am trying to understand it myself. I am adamant that circular reasoning is not acceptable. I am open to any reformulation of thermodynamics. I am willing to throw out all of the laws of thermodynamics and start from scratch, but I will not settle for circular reasoning and I will not settle for quotes from famous people which seem to contradict my understanding without asking for a rational explanation. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 00:36, 29 September 2011 (UTC)

:Oh, my argument has flaws. Let me point them out before being flogged. (Remember, it's been decades since I've read Callen.) It's fairly easy to use walls to derive the first law; but that leaves you adrift in mathematical abstraction. Here's why.

:Thermodynamics is simple to derive by differentiating energy to S, V, &c, then T, -p, &c, then specific heats. Energy is very abstract, and difficult to comprehend. This is differentiating left to right. The really hard part is using it to solve problems.

:Historically, and operationally, thermodynamics can be presented by integrating the above quantities right to left. This presentation is not as elegant, but is closer to applications. Operationally, you need temperature to calculate heat flux. Consequently, if you create an axiomatic presentation (which is not for teaching), the reasoning will always be circular if you take the easy route: to measure an object, you need an object derived by differentiation that you have not yet defined.

:My preferred method of teaching is to solve famous problems in petrology using only necessary and sufficient quantities. Each solution to a problem is therefore a proof to a theorem, a theorem of value in geology. My personal axiomatic theory starts with volume, and integrates. By defining temperature from the operations used to measure it, I move the zeroth law to this definition, eliminating an axiom. I also suggest you eliminate the so-called 'third law'.

:Note also that, if not already corrected, you should separate classical, non-equilibriums (there were many), and statistical thermodynamics (the many)--I would discuss only classical, equilibrium thermodynamics, develop the theory from either left or right (not both), not distinguish heat flow and radiation when discussing the flux of heat (for experiments can't, to my knowledge), and decide whether to explain fundamentals or discuss obscure applications; but don't try both. If Chjoaygame takes the historical approach, I would probably support that--if simplified greatly. Just some ideas to think about.

BTW, I never understood science until I read D.T. Suzuki's 'Outline of Mahayana Buddhism'. However, I do not recommend reading it: there are far easier, more appropriate works. :-)

Also, because Chjoaygame doesn't have a User page, I wish to tell him that I think I changed his answer to the query of whether equilibrium systems can be thermally heterogeneous in 'Equilibrium systems are homogeneous?' from (I think) no, to yes.

'''Response to PAR's comment''': "you made the statement that the first law is not about conservation of energy, which is flat wrong." Dear Par, most of what you have said above I am letting go to the wicketkeeper, but this one is bodyline. You have utterly misunderstood my explicit statements, utterly misquoted me, when you write this. I don't know what has got into you that you misquote me so. I really don't know where you got it from that I said that the first law is not about conservation of energy. Indeed, the line that I wrote in response to your desire to see more emphasis on energy conservation was "The '''first law of thermodynamics''' tells how [[energy transfer|transfers]] of [[heat]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] between [[thermodynamic system]]s [[Law of conservation of energy|conserve energy]]."

Let me be clear, in case re-reading is not enough to clarify it: I think and always have thought, that the first law is about conservation of energy. But a statement that 'the first law of thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy', pure and simple, would be wrong, though it now seems to have won the day, largely in consequence of your efforts. If it were right, then we would be talking about merging the two articles, which we are not. The first law of thermodynamics is a law of thermodynamics and deserves to be stated as such, even though it is about conservation of energy.

As you have said and as I have agreed explicitly, the first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the law of conservation of energy applied to thermodynamics.

:::You wrote:"Just to be sure, do we agree that the first law is a particular case of the general law of conservation of energy? In other words, the general law includes all forms of energy, including thermal energy, while the first law is a particular case which specifically includes thermal energy."

:::I replied: "Yes, or nearly yes. The first law is a particular case of the general law of conservation of energy. It specifically refers to transfers of energy as heat and as work. The phrase "thermal energy" should be used to refer specifically to transfer of energy, because otherwise it might be hard to define in some circumstances."

The term "thermal energy" is not quite according to the MCC laws in an introductory article on thermodynamics, and that is the reason for my reservation "or nearly yes". "Thermal energy", in the present context, is a possibly confusing term: often it is used to refer to a virtual decomposition of internal energy into a 'potential energy' term and a 'molecular kinetic energy' term; though not utterly wrong, that decomposition applies only in very restricted way, and is not straight up and down the line of the wicket thermodynamics.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 13:21, 29 September 2011 (UTC)

== Thermodynamics is a Class of Theories ==

One source of confusion in the writing of this article was to treat thermodynamics as one theory, or -- seemingly truth. It is not true: it is science. I've learned at least a dozen different theories that can be expressed by varying the axioms or definitions. Prigogine's non-equilibrium theories number at least four.

When geologists solve geological problems, they will often divide the problem into many smaller ones, then apply one physical theory to each of these. This doesn't mix ideas. Mixing them confuses what you have when you finish.

I suggest you choose which theories to present, or sketch each and link the more important ones to separate articles. In particular, it is bad to mix classical and statistical statements in the same paragraph.

(The good news is, I've been sent a monograph by Jouguet, which I'm translating into English. Many will agree I've contributed enough here. So, it's time to break the champagne! Bye; and best of luck with this most important of articles!)

=== Fewer References? ===

It's occurred to me that the 'theories' of thermodynamics, which number as many as the varied references, may be keeping this article from a 'good' status. Every book is internally consistent with one classical thermodynamics (definitions & axioms), but they mix like apples and oranges: some define equilibrium using a characteristic function, some use homogeneity (and some wrt time, Fermi wrt the environment). In short, each reference gives a different set of opinions about what is important and what isn't.

The article might use one approach (one classical theory), which would dictate the important topics to cover, which might permit a cleaner writing style.

As an example, theories for chemists, which start with Clausius's two laws, use energy and entropy and need a quick existence theorem for temperature: the zeroth law. If one starts with fundamentals, which use thermometers, this law can be dropped.

Physicists are interested in Nernst's Theorem, and it's important in cryogenics; but no natural science but astrophysics can use it. It could be minimized. (Also it requires quantum statistical thermodynamics rather than a steam engine.)

Ironically, reducing the number of authorities might help the article. That said, I can recommend Fermi, E. 1937. Thermodynamics. NJ: Prentice-Hall; and possibly Pippard, A.B. 1957.

== Is entropy an extensive variable? ==

The article says “entropy in general does not fit the above definition of an extensive variable” (Section “Thermodynamic state variables”). But in the articles [[Entropy]] and [[Intensive and extensive properties]] entropy is declared as an extensive property. What is true? Greetings [[Special:Contributions/2.38.190.84|2.38.190.84]] ([[User talk:2.38.190.84|talk]]) 15:50, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

::This is a very reasonable question.

::The term of art 'entropy' was invented by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in the early days of thermodynamics. Its mathematical equivalent had been used previously by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] and by Clausius. It was a variable of state of a closed thermodynamic system. Its definition has been changed over the years, because it is a difficult concept. Nowadays it is admitted by many writers (example Kondepudi 2008) that it may apply also to an open system. It was by one major classical thermodynamicist, [[Max Planck]], early regarded as a quantity in its own right, subject to its own laws, but later Planck admitted that it had a statistical mechanical basis and could not be understood otherwise. Planck's change of mind was due to his discovery of his law of thermal radiation and to work by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and by [[Albert Einstein]].

::Thermodynamics is severely crippled when it cannot access the concept of entropy. Access to the concept of entropy is very safe for the study of systems, open or closed, in strict thermodynamic equilibrium. For systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium, the concept of entropy is fairly safe in the special case of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Away from local thermodynamic equilibrium the concept is unsafe. For example, a top expert on the question, Walter T. Grandy, Jr, is of the view that we do not know even how to calculate the entropy of a worm (''Entropy and the Time Evolution of Macroscopic Systems'' (2008), Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954617-6}}). Classical thermodynamics has little or nothing to contribute to the definition of entropy for systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. A probabilistic or statistical definition seems unavoidable. Grandy and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]] are perhaps the safest guides to trying to understand the probabilistic approach.

::Some scientists do not like to feel crippled by ignorance, and have difficulty saying "I don't know", and this prejudices them, for the present problem, to postulate instead of providing reliable reason. Many writers on non-equilibrium thermodynamics thus simply postulate that an entropy function exists when they need it, and they give the impression that this is sound science. But it's often just wishful thinking, without a proper scientific basis. As part of this wishful thinking, they postulate that entropy for their non-equilibrium studies is an extensive variable.

::'''Entropy is assuredly and safely an extensive variable for suitably defined classical thermodynamic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.'''

::'''But that does not make it extensive for far-from-equilibrium systems as wished by such wishful thinkers.'''

::The definition of thermodynamic concepts for non-equilibrium systems must take into account that such systems can undergo major structural fluctuations, and such fluctuations will destroy the postulated basis for simple postulates of entropy for such systems. So far as I know, no one has provided a general way of calculating the entropy of practically encountered far-from-equilibrium systems, precisely for this reason. This means that in general, so far as I can find in the literature, '''entropy is in general not an extensive variable for far-from-equilibrium systems''', although many writers wish that it were so. For a careful discussion of this question I can do no better than recommend Grandy's above-mentioned book, especially Chapter 5, headed 'The presumed extensivity of entropy'. After you have read that, perhaps further discussion might be useful.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 19:24, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

== Bias against the Existance of Equilibrium in Nature ==

One of the reasons, IMO, this article is flawed is its insistence that thermodynamics concludes equilibrium is only approached. (This throws unwarranted importance on theories of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.) No theory of thermodynamics I have ever seen makes any statement whether or not equilibrium is attained. (Text writers, of course, may express opinions; the article appears to misrepresent these.)

Classical thermodynamics assumed equilibrium when deriving practical relations, but the history section has 'equilibrium' Bowdlerized, making it highly flawed. Callen's statement arguing for equilibrium in nature has been used as a reference for the opposite statement. Finally, to demonstrate that natural processes are all non-equilibrium, one obscure process (hysteresis in solids--the model of non-equilibrium cycles for decades) was pulled out, seemingly from a hat. This looks like bias.

Closed systems are represented by a system and its surrounding environment, as stated in the article. Thermodynamics is used, as stated in the article, to predict the response to a perturbation. 

Geologists have shown that the response keeps pace with the perturbation, such as extremely slow burial. Such a response is usually accurately predictable from the perturbation. According to Prigogine & Defay's definition of equilibrium, this is a path of equilibrium states.

Those definitions that involve time simply mean the system does not drop its Gibbs energy below a limit, an equilibrium value: a high explosive may reach this value in less than a second. In summary, equilibrium is a limiting state, but thermodynamics does not predict it is approached asymptotically. (The remark about detailed balancing and equilibrium requiring microscopic reversibility is wrong: it is the macroscopic rates of these processes that must be equal.) 

Equilibrium is simply the correlation of perturbation and response, which allows prediction. Even geologists don't throw up their hands when asked to predict the perturbation from the measured response because the extents of nuclear reactions were unknown when the chemical reactions stopped. (The widely ranging compositions of univariant oxides in viscous rhyolites that equilibrated when temporarily housed in shallow magma chambers fall flawlessly along a straight line predicted by equiibrium. This serves as a test for equilibrium in nature.)

This article won't be considered a good one (well, by me at least) until the above bias is proved either non-existant or corrected. (Good luck, Mr Phelps. :-)

== demotion of importance of concept of thermodynamic equilibrium ==

There has been some complaint recently that the article was underemphasizing the importance of thermodynamic equilibrium. The sentence "Thermodynamic equilibrium is one of the most important concepts for thermodynamics" was not enough to deflect this complaint. Now the new edit has deliberately demoted the importance of the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium by replacing that sentence with "Thermodynamic equilibrium is an important concept in thermodynamics."

Callen 1985 on page 26 writes: "''The single all-encompassing problem of thermodynamics is the determination of the equilibrium state that eventually results after the removal of internal constraints in a closed composite system.''" Callen is one of the most widely cited theoreticians of thermodynamics. I think that statement of his goes too far, and is the work of a theoretician, and I am not particularly enamoured of Callen's presentation, though I recognize that it has merits. (When Callen writes "closed system", we understand that he means "isolated system".)

Most thermodynamics, theoretical as well as practical, works with at least the local thermodynamic equilibrium concept as one of its most important elements, and so I would say that the demotion was not a good move. I would like to restore the sentence "Thermodynamic equilibrium is one of the most important concepts for thermodynamics."[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 14:58, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

The new edit downplays the fact that there are many processes of nature that progress so rapidly or irregularly that they cannot feasibly be followed by currently known thermodynamics, because they are too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, the new edit might seem to suggest that nature tends to limit her activities to those that are within the scope of a version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which makes their study only "a little more involved but of much more practical importance".

The new edit in the introduction refers to inhomogeneity of systems, studied in engineering, before the concept of homogeneity of a system has been defined in the article. It does not make it clear at this point that there is a close relation between the concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium and the proviso required by the edit, that "the thermodynamic parameters are well defined."

The lead has already told the reader that "Thermodynamics can be applied to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering", but, in the introductory section of the article, the new edit, apparently not concerned with processes in nature, wants to further emphasize the practical importance of the engineering use of thermodynamics.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 00:24, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

: I agree - to downplay the role of equilibrium in thermodynamics is like downplaying the role of space and time in relativity. Local thermodynamic equilibrium is simply equilibrium thermodynamics applied to a continuum of systems. It does not downplay the role of equilibrium, it emphasizes it. Other methods of dealing with non-equilibrium thermodynamics involve perturbations of the equilibrium state, again, emphasizing the importance of equilibrium. The four laws are stated for systems in equilibrium.

:Thank you Damorbel for your helpful suggestions. I have taken them aboard, and improved the wording in consequence, and supplied some references.

Due to that, the part-word -dynamics refers to the doing of work by the engine, which is of course a comcomitant of heat transfer through the engine, which accounts for the part-word thermo-. It is occasionally proposed in various writings that one might speak of 'thermostatics' because the classical subject admits only static or equilibrium states.

Your 'meaning of 'thermodynamics' argument just doesn't meet the situation. Sure, thermodynamics emerged from the discovery of the mechanical equivalent of heat, but a lot has happened since then. Don't you think it would be (is) absurd to invent new words everytime  new features such as chemical interactions and mechanical interactions with photons involving thermal energy are discovered? No you are trying to change history, generally recognised as an academic defect.

This is why it is quite wrong to define heat as 'energy in transit', it doesn't match the experimental evidence i.e. the fact that temperature heat and thermal energy are all manifestations of particle motion. --[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 12:50, 9 September 2012 (UTC)

Actually, it is a _grave_mistake_ to confuse thermodynamics with heat transfer or with chemical reactions solely. The basic laws of thermoynamics are of _general_ applicabilty. Energy is the ability to do work, but it is also reduced in availability by heat transfer. How much enegy is "used up" as heat in the changes of state of the system and it's sourroundings is governed by the increase of total entropy. What ammount of energy a perfect crystal has at absolute zero is established in the third law. The zeroth law is about thermal equilibrium. The laws of thermodynamics apply troughout physics, not on specific situations.

Actually the first law of thermodynamics implies that _all_ of the change in the energy of the system is equal to the heat that the system releases to the sorroundings plus the work that the system exerts on the sorroundings: ΔE=Q+W. See:

:Dear Damorbel, you seem to have taken upon yourself the office of policeman, prosecutor, judge and jury to dictate how I may edit in the Wikipedia. You demand that I give reasons for my edits in the talk pages. This is simply a captious demand by you, and has no proper basis. It seems obvious that you take this role as a way of responding to the fact that I accept the general consensus of Wikipedia thermodynamic editors that in physics, heat is technical concept that refers to a process not to a state, while you hold unflinchingly to your belief that heat should be treated simply as a word of the ordinary language that seems more or less to be able to be used for states as well as for processes, along with other ideas you have repeatedly expressed on this subject. If you wish to change my edits because you can improve them, that I see as your privilege. But you seem to regard it as your prerogative to simply dictate how I edit, and to undo any edit of mine that does not conform to your dictation as to how you think it should have been done.

:This revision of mine was substantial only in your judgement, but looked at more objectively it was a rewording and more precise explication of what was already in the article, but not adequately explicitly.

:Your stated reason for your undoing of my edit seems specious and irrational. Your stated reason is  "The claim is that Themodynamics is ''empirical''". Evidently your stated reason refers to this sentence in the article: "The macroscopic state variables of thermodynamics have been recognized in the course of empirical work in physics and chemistry.<ref name="Prigogine and Defay 1954"/>" This statement in the article was not new in my edit, but had stood in the article for some long time. It is a precise statement directly based on a nearly identical statement cited in the article as from a well respected text by a respected Nobel Prize winner and a respected colleague of his. It is not my invention and is not new in this edit. The statement is not about thermodynamics in general as stated by you. It is about the finding of suitable state variables, which is stated by Prigogine and Defay, as cited, to be based on empirical work. If you had a real objection to this statement long present in the article, it would be odd that you express it only now that I repeat it unchanged. One wonders if you have really checked and considered what Prigogine and Defay have to say about this. This makes your undoing of my edit seem specious and irrational.

You say that you have a "basic objection" to the article, that it gives no name to the kinetic energy of the particles in a thermodynamic system. You are trying, yet again after many previous tries, to lure me into a detailed discussion with you. I have found by bitter experience with you in the past that it is futile to try to engage in detailed discussion with you because your style is persistently irrational.

:Foolishly perhaps I will try just once to help you with your present difficulties. My revision, as I indicated with my cover note, makes more explicit the fundamental logical interrelations of the constituent concepts of thermodynamics, namely, of the notions of working body of the system and of the surroundings, and the thermodynamic processes that link them. Thermodynamics mostly in the early days focused on the processes, in particular the cyclic processes. Their cyclic character ensures that they leave the working body of the system effectively intact, though the working bodies of the surroundings are supposed to change and signal the nature of the processes. An approach that is in some ways more convenient is to consider the states of thermodynamic equilibrium of the working body of the system at the times in between the times of the processes. In this approach, the states of thermodyanmic equilibrium supersede the effective intactness of the working body.

:Your "basic objection" represents a fundamental misunderstanding of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is essentially about the processes or about the thermodynamic states of the working body regarded as a macroscopic object fully specified by the state variables. It is essential here to ignore and avoid mention of "the particles in a thermodynamic system", because consideration of such particles is foreign to thermodynamics, as you may verify for yourself by checking the references or more generally reading about it. Consideration of such particles belongs to statistica mechanics. It is true that some writers of student texts think they are very clever and can teach thermodynamics and statistical mechanics at the same time, but as is apparent in your case, this tends to lead students to muddle thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in their minds. The point about thermodynamics, its peculiar and characteristic merit, is that it reveals what can be found without any consideration of the particles in the system. You are seeking to destroy the thermodynamic essence of the article in pursuing your interest in the statistical mechanical explanation of the macroscopic thermodynamics. The statistical thermodynamic explanations are not wrong and are not to be avoided in general, but they are essentially irrelevant to the basic structure of thermodynamics, and it would be a mistake to let them intrude inappropriately into an article on thermodynamics as if they were its main concern.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 14:04, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

Chjoaygame, Thermodynamics is about the energy in systems of particles. According to the circumstances and distribution of the energy these particles have various states giving rise to descriptors called [[thermodynamic state|thermodynamic states]] (see also [[Functions of state]])

Now you write "It is essential here to ignore and avoid mention of "the particles in a thermodynamic system", I think you should, in the light of these references explain why you are have this view about the irelevance of systems of particles so that other authors may seek to agree with you. --[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 14:56, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

== edit by Maurice Carbonaro ==

Thank you, Maurice Carbonaro, for your thoughts on this. For the sake of civility, I am not right now undoing your edit, but I think it is retrograde step and should be undone. Contrary to your interpretation of what it attempts, the lead as it stood neither intended nor attempted to give all four laws; it intended only to summarize the main outlines. The zeroth law is a technicality and the third law is also rather esoteric. Neither of them can be readily summarized for the lead, nor do I think a summary of them is needed there. The lead is a summary of the main points of the article. I think your setting out the laws in numbered paragraphs is not going in the right direction, and is no improvement. It would perhaps be better, if you insist that the present lead needs reform, to remove the two statements that are now there than to add two more.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 23:21, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

== The opening statement. ==

When dealing with the article it is best to isolate (if possible) the multiple defects from each other.

The third para. has:-
:::''The first law asserts the existence of a quantity called the internal energy of a system, which is distinguishable from the kinetic energy of bulk movement of the system and from its potential energy with respect to its surroundings.''

Which is quite incorrect. It should be:

:::''Energy can be neither created or destroyed''

Plus, for clarification:- 

[[Mass–energy equivalence|Energy and matter are equivalent]] through Einstein's formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>

Further,  Waleswatcher's observations on PAR's edit are quite correct; this edit should be undone, it is quite incorrect.

== PAR's recent edit ==

PAR edited the introduction to emphasize that the second law doesn't just have to do with entropy, but also temperature.  I don't entirely agree.  The second law is usually formulated in a way that does not explicitly refer to any thermodynamic quantity other than entropy.  For instance, wiki's [[second law of thermodynamics|formulation]] is
:The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of closed systems never decreases, because closed systems spontaneously evolve towards thermal equilibrium -- the state of maximum entropy. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind are impossible.
While it's true all the laws of thermodynamics involve temperature indirectly, they also involve pressure, volume, chemical potential, etc. etc., I don't see why the second law should be singled out that way.  Instead, I'd start that paragraph with the zeroth law to introduce temperature.

===response by PAR===

Before you get to the second law, temperature and entropy are undefined. Prior to the laws, there are certain assumptions. For example, it is assumed that you can know when two systems are thermally connected or isolated from each other, and you know when two systems are or are not in thermal equilibrium with each other. Using the concept of equilibrium, the zeroth law then lays some groundwork for the concept of temperature, but does not define it. The first law introduces the concepts of internal energy, work and heat, but still no temperature. Work is a mechanical concept and is defined "externally" and is the only directly measurable quantity. For a simple system, its just a function of the measurable pressure and volume. The first law declares internal energy to be a state variable, and heat is defined as the energy difference between the total change in internal energy and the energy added by work. The second law then states that the heat can be expressed as the product of two new quantities: temperature and entropy (<math>\delta q=T dS</math>) and that they are state variables, unlike their product <math>\delta q</math>.

All this assumes a fixed quantity of matter in the system, another directly measurable quantity. You can go on to develop the whole train of thought assuming variable quantities of matter, which introduces the chemical potential. I'm not offering this as the absolute revealed truth of thermodynamics. Its just a step towards sorting out the logic of thermodynamics, avoiding all the circular reasoning, like introducing temperature to define thermal equilibrium and thermal connection, then using those same concepts to define the Carnot cycle, then using the Carnot cycle to define temperature, etc. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 16:14, 3 December 2012 (UTC)

===response by Chjoaygame===

In summary I will here say that I think the lead is a summary of the main points, not the place for detailed presentation of argument. I would be unhappy to see further extension of argument in the lead.

The "zeroth law" is a fancy name given in 1939 by Fowler and Guggenheim to a proposition that Maxwell stated clearly in 1871. Maxwell used the word temperature in two ways, which are now distinguished as empirical temperature and absolute thermodynamic temperature. For empirical temperature, Maxwell was happy just to say 'temperature', because the term was long established by tradition. When Maxwell meant absolute thermodynamic temperature, he said 'absolute temperature', shock, horror! Since Bryan in 1907 and Carathéodory in 1909 and Born in 1921 proposed to change the terminology, it is considered a gigantic advance of understanding that plain temperature, or empirical temperature, was re-named 'the value of the non-deformation state variable', and the word temperature was reserved for absolute temperature. It is advanced as old-fashioned circular reasoning removed by brilliantly insightful new thinking that careless confounding of empirical temperature and absolute temperature were made less likely by prohibiting the traditional usage of 'temperature' to refer to empirical temperature. If one carelessly failed to distinguish between empirical temperature and absolute temperature, one would be led into circular reasoning, not a mistake made by nineteenth century physicists, but apparently one much to be guarded against since then.

The empirical temperature as fact is built inextricably into Carathéodory's formulation, as the one extra variable, beyond those that specify directly the mechanical work processes available to the working body, necessary to fully define the thermodynamic state of a body; it is called the "non-deformation variable". This extra variable can be regarded as an empirical temparature, and is essential for the Carathéodory formulation, which however forbids the word temperature from being attached to it. This "non-deformation" variable is postulated by Carathéodory to be changeable by processes that take place through a wall said by him to be "permeable only to ″heat″", though heat as such is not admitted into his formulation. Physically, then, heat must be energy as it permeates a wall "permeable only to ″heat″", or "permeable ″only to heat″", according to Carathéodory. Physically, what kind of energy is that? It turns out to be, surprise, surprise, energy that is described by the "non-deformation variable". What is the physical meaning of this? It means that energy is transferred as heat between two bodies connected by a wall "permeable only to ″heat″" when the values of their "non-deformation" variable differ. And that silly old nineteenth century fool Maxwell thought that energy was transferred as heat when bodies that differed only in temperature were brought into diathermal connection! What fools they were in the nineteenth century! How clever we are today![[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 00:34, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

Fowler & Guggenheim (1939/1965), apparently the inventors of the label "zeroth law", formulate the basic ideas of thermodynamics in a way, derived from Carathéodory's, that acknowledges Carathéodeory's as "most logically satisfactory [...but...] rather too abstract". Their statement (on page 60) of the second law explicitly states that the absolute temperature, {{math|''T''}}, is a function of only the empirical temperature, {{math|''t''}}. In other words, they assume the meaning of the empirical temperature, as a quantity that is represented on a scale of real numbers, as a presupposition for the second law. On examination of their text, however, one finds that their version of the zeroth law differs from the previous versions, which were not labeled as the zeroth law. Their version of the "zeroth law" offers one of the important ingredients of the notion of empirical temperature. But it is not explicit about the necessary associated context routinely expressed by those who discussed empirical temperature before them. That context, omitted by Fowler & Guggenheim, was that thermal equilibrium may be seen to be reached specifically in the interaction between two bodies with different "non-deformation" variables when they are connected by a wall "permeable only to ″heat″". Such a context is needed to get from the mere words of the "zeroth law" as Fowler & Guggenheim state it to the notion of temperature as a quantity that they assume can be represented on a scale of real numbers. [[Ernst Mach]] in the nineteenth century pointed out the ideas needed to establish temperature as a quantity represented on a scale of real numbers, but Fowler & Guggenheim do not mention these ideas in detail. Modern experts in the theory of thermodynamics, such as [[James Serrin]], recognize the importance of Mach's discussion. Instead of referring to Mach, Fowler & Guggenheim (on page 56) define empirical temperature as [[Max Planck]] did before them, in terms of the volume of a reference body at constant pressure. Though it seems that they were the inventors of the label "zeroth law", Fowler & Guggenheim's eventual statement (on page 60) of the second law does not mention entropy, using instead the idea of free energy.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 06:16, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

While Waleswatcher's start to this section says that PAR edited the introduction. To be precise, he edited the lead. Reasons for keeping the lead very short are perhaps not binding on an introduction. Every Wikipedia article, I think, has a lead, but only some, perhaps the more complicated ones, have also an introduction.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 06:32, 4 December 2012 (UTC)

== "Average" properties ==

The opening of the current version of the article has (1<sup>st</sup> line): -
''...defines macroscopic variables (such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, and pressure) that describe '''average''' properties of material bodies and radiation,...''
Some of the properties listed do not have ''average'' values, they are [[intensive properties]] i.e. they are ''local'' e.g. temperature.

I propose to remove (soon!) the word ''average'' from the above quotation. --[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 07:39, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

:That seems reasonable to me. Indeed I would go further and remove the words 'average properties of'. The words 'properties of' add nothing to the meaning, and indeed are pleonastic to a fault. I think "...defines macroscopic variables (such as temperature, internal energy, entropy, and pressure) that describe material bodies and radiation,...' would be better.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 12:10, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

::Hmmmm! How is it that "The words 'properties of' add nothing"? Are temperature and pressure not properties? I agree they are not the complete properties. As for "variables", surely these are descriptors in e.g. equations - not properties as in ''[[Materials science|properties of materials]]''
::There is a further problem here (line 4):-
::::''Thermodynamics does not describe the microscopic constituents of matter, and its laws can be derived from statistical mechanics.''
::Agreed, thermodynamics ''does not describe the microscopic '''constituents''' of matter''. Again, far too general. Surely it would read better as:-
::::''Thermodynamics describes the microscopic and macrosopic properties of [[energy]] in matter, and its [[thermodynamic laws]], which may be derived from [[statistical mechanics]].''

===response by Waleswatcher===

Temperature is of course an average property.  For instance in a gas, it is proportional to the average kinetic energy per molecule.  In radiation, it is related to the average frequency of the photons.  But a randomly chosen individual particle or collection of particles will not have precisely that average energy.  <small>'''<span style="color:Olive">Waleswatcher</span>''' [[User_talk:Waleswatcher#top|''(<span style="color:green">talk</span>)'']]</small> 14:10, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

::I'm fully aware of the meaning of "intensive", Damorbel.  I'm a professional physicist and use the terms every day.  Intensive quantities in thermo are precisely averages (rather than, say, totals).  In the case of T, again, it's the ''average'' kinetic energy per molecule.  Think for a minute - does every molecule in a container of gas have exactly the same kinetic energy at all times?  Obviously not - and yet we characterize a huge collection of molecules by one number, T.  Clearly, it's an average. <small>'''<span style="color:Olive">Waleswatcher</span>''' [[User_talk:Waleswatcher#top|''(<span style="color:green">talk</span>)'']]</small>

:::Waleswatcher, did you look at my [[temperature|link]]? In the thermodynamics article the word ''average'' is used far too loosely.

:::::Indeed "planetary equilibrium temperature" is not immediately relevant, that is something for advanced students.
:::::But you seem not to be fully aware of the meaning of "[[intensive quantities]]"? Or the meaning of temperature. A temperature can only be defined for a system in equilibrium, a system not in equilibrium has two or more temperatures, the requirement for a ''single'' temperature being that the particle energy has a [[Maxwell Boltzmann distribution]]

:::::Of course, as I remarked before, the temperature of a thermodynamic system is independent of the size of the system; rather intuitive don't you think? This drives one to the logical conclusion that the smallest system that can have a temperature is a system comprising only one particle!

:::::The meaning of the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution (an important thermodynamic concept) is statistical of course; (possibly from statistical mechanics - do you think?) In a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution the particles have an equal probability of accessing the system states. --[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel#top|talk]]) 19:58, 30 November 2012 (UTC)

There are various viewpoints about temperature. One view, from statistical thermodynamics, is put by Balescu, R. (1975), ''Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics'', Wiley–Interscience, New York, {{ISBN|0-471-04600-0}}, on page 43. He writes: "... we cannot define the temperature as an average of a microscopic function taken with an arbitrary distribution function [as implied by Eq. (2.2.4)]: It rather appears as ''a parameter characterizing the particular distribution function describing the system in thermal equilibrium.'' He adds in a footnote that the statement of temperature as an average kinetic energy for an ideal gas is correct, but that it is not a definition. Another source might be Chapman, S. Cowling, T.G. (1939/1970), ''The Mathematical Theory of Non-Uniform Gases. An Account of the Kinetic Theory of Viscosity, Thermal Conduction and Diffusion in Gases'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK. They give several discussions of the difference in formal status between the thermodynamic and the kinetic theory of gases definitions of temperature, and proceed to examine how far they give coincident physical results. For the case of mixtures of rare gases, they say on page 8 of the third edition that "The kinetic theory is able to give a fairly satisfactory affirmative answer to this question (4.3), to this extent justifying its procedure as regards temperature definition." They then discuss how this may relate to temperatures for processes involving materials other than gases.

Dear Damorbel, by the way, you write above "... the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution (an important thermodynamic concept)..." This is not in accord with the views of some sources on thermodynamics who take a viewpoint different from the pedagogical strategy, for example, of Kittel & Kroemer and of Reif. The viewpoint of Adkins, C.J. (191968/1983), ''Equilibrium Thermodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|0-521-25445-0}}, may be summarized by the following from page 2 of the third edition: "The laws of thermodynamics enable us to interrelate the macroscopic quantities ''without making any microscopic assumptions'' at all. The great generality of thermodynamics is a direct consequence of this."[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 03:12, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:Chjoaygame, I have looked at your ref. "Another source might be Chapman, S. Cowling," and I find what they say on p36 ff. under '''definitions and theorems''' section 2.4.1 - ''Temperature''. In this section you will find what I am arguing is the theoretical basis for the concept of ''temperature''. At the bottom of p37 last paragraph, it has:-

:* I don't have that reference, but unfortunately neither heat nor temperature can be defined generally in terms of kinetic energy, because that's not the case for all systems.  Thermal and statistical physics is much more powerful and general than that.  For instance there are well-studied systems in which the temperature is negative.  Still, in most familiar cases the "temperature is average kinetic/vibrational/rotational energy per molecule" is true, and can and should be used as an example in these articles.  <small>'''<span style="color:Olive">Waleswatcher</span>''' [[User_talk:Waleswatcher#top|''(<span style="color:green">talk</span>)'']]</small> 13:47, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:*Waleswatcher is right, Damorbel, when he refutes your comment and writes as above: "...neither heat nor temperature can be defined generally in terms of kinetic energy, because that's not the case for all systems ..." As you may see, the kinetic theory of gases definition of temperature is specific for that theory, which is about gases, while, as I have noted several times, though it seems to have escaped your eagle eye, the kinetic theory of gases has not much to say about liquids or solids. The greater generality claimed by Chapman & Cowling is that they refer to a gas not in equilibrium, but their definition does not extend to non-gaseous materials. As I recall, you are habitually very keen to insist that temperature belongs only to an equilibrium state. It is inconsistent of you now to crow about a definition of temperature that claims to be for a non-equilibrium state.
::Dear Damorbel, you are lost, not aware of which article you are writing in. You are trying to put the kinetic theory of gases definition into the article on thermodynamics.

A version of Statistical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Chemistry'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, on page 38 write [their italics]: "''Thus {{math|θ}} is a parameter helping to define the state of our assembly which must have the same value for all sets of systems in the assembly.''" The same view is proposed by Tolman, R.C. (1938), ''The Principles of Statistical Mechanics'', Oxford University Press, London, who writes on page 563: "...the parameter {{math|''θ''}} characterizes only the particular kind of ensembles, with canonical distribution, which we use to represent systems in thermodynamic equilibrium." The kinetic theory of gases, which explicitly defines its own version of temperature as an average kinetic energy, and as distinct from thermodynamic temperature, is closely related to statistical mechanics, but applies mainly to gases, without much consideration of liquids or solids.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 05:03, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

After his latest efforts at [[Talk:Boltzmann constant]] I've made a proposal at [[WT:PHYSICS]] that [[User:Damorbel]] be community topic-banned from further editing articles and talk pages related to thermodynamics.

The views of those who've interacted with him on this talk page would be useful, since he appears to have edited here extensively as well. [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 21:45, 8 December 2012 (UTC)

== Thermodynamics of small systems ==

How about including a section with this title?
Thermodynamics only applies in the limit of number of constituents goes to infinity (the thermodynamic limit). As systems get small, the laws of classical thermodynamics break down and other equations have to be used instead. Quantities that are constant in classic thermodynamics become stochastic variables (right?). I think that a section discussing this would help make the transition between the behavior of single molecules and that of macroscopic systems clearer (I would certainly appreciate it).

For references, Hill's classic "Thermodynamics of small systems" is almost impossible to obtain. I have found an open access article by John Rowlinson, whose authority cannot be doubted, however it is not as focussed as I'd like. I also found a nice little open access article in PNAS on the thermodynamics of single protein molecules. We need some better candidates, IMHO. Surely there must be a recent review?

What do you think of this idea?

:For my part I suggest it may be difficult to define what a small thermodynmic system is. Thermodynamics is the physics of particles and their interactions, the relevant physical interactions are independent of the systen size. Obviously as the sample size decreases the variation in the measurements such as e.g. pressure must deviate increasingly from the mean. For pressure this variation shows up as random accoustic noise. --[[User:Damorbel|Damorbel]] ([[User talk:Damorbel|talk]]) 12:04, 6 January 2013 (UTC)

== surroundings and environment ==

There is a new edit by Editor [[User:Zedshort|Zedshort]] that changes the word 'surroundings' to the word 'environment', with links to an article [[Environment (systems)]]. That article is more like a dictionary entry than an encyclopaedia article. The sole reference in that article is to Richard Dawkins, not a book about thermodynamics.

The cited references in the present article on thermodynamics are Guggenheim and Kondepudi. On page 9, Guggenheim writes "... the rest of the universe (its surroundings)" twice. On page 4, Kondepudi writes "... dividing the world into a 'system' and its 'exterior'". Looking a little further, I find Bailyn on page 20 writing of a "uniform environment". I find Adkins on page 4 writing that "Everything outside the system is called the ''surroundings''". I find Callen on page 15 writing of the "“walls” that separate it [the system] from its surroundings." Planck on page 114 writes of "such changes in the surrounding medium". On page 108, Pippard writes "If the system is open to the surroundings ...". On page 127 Partington writes: "All things outside the system are spoken of as external bodies. ... so that no heat or work can be exchanged with the surroundings." Kirkwood & Oppenheim on page 1 write "The ''surroundings'' are the rest of the physical world. ... An ''isolated system'' has no interactions with the surroundings." On page 6, the translator of Münster writes "A system is called ''closed'' when it can exchange energy with its surroundings but cannot exchange matter ..."[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 22:24, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

== article structure comment in Introduction ==

The end of the Introduction section has the following statement

''"The present article takes a gradual approach to the subject, starting with a focus on cyclic processes and thermodynamic equilibrium, and then gradually beginning to further consider non-equilibrium systems."''

Is it right to describe an Encyclopedia article as if it is a textbook chapter?

:Thermodynamics is a large subject. The purpose of the sentence is to alert the reader to the logical structure of the article. It starts with a particularly simple case and then moves to the more general.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 04:53, 24 August 2014 (UTC)

== undid good faith edit; reason ==

I removed the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&diff=prev&oldid=656066449 new image] of a steam engine. The image is colourful, juicy, and interesting. It might well relieve the rather dry nature of thermodynamics. But I think not suitable for where it was posted.

The reason is that the image is very much a moving picture. Classical thermodynamics, the  main topic of the article, is essentially about states of thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the kind of movement in the image has ceased. The moving image would give the reader a false sense of direction. Classical thermodynamics is used in the consideration of such movement, but only as an idealized limiting case. It is misleading to present an idealized limiting case as if it were typical.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 05:33, 12 April 2015 (UTC)

Editor [[User:HenryGroupman|HenryGroupman]]'s contribution record shows those as his only activities, and I infer that he is a single-purpose promotional user with a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] that makes those activities inappropriate. If so, we are looking at a conduct problem as distinct from a content problem. I would ask editor [[User:HenryGroupman|HenryGroupman]] to desist from such activities, so as to avoid further process over conduct, in an administrative forum.

== request for clarification ==

Editor [[User:Isambard Kingdom|Isambard Kingdom]] has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&type=revision&diff=675907949&oldid=675894008 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&diff=next&oldid=675907949 here] restored his requests for clarification at particular points of the section headed '''Introduction'''. It is good to see his quick vigilance. Since he is deprecating my positive attempt at clarification, I have undone it.

It would help if he would give some guidance as to how he finds unclarity at those particular points. I accept that the sentences to which he refers are summary, but I think more detail about their meaning is to had by reading further in the article, and that more detail at points he has indicated would be deteriorative. It seems to me hardly reasonable to expect complete clarity of a subtle subject to be evident in every isolated sentence. Would he kindly give some indication of what kind of further clarity he is requesting?[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 14:34, 13 August 2015 (UTC)

:There's no need to remove the statement on energy that you previously contributed. I just think more needs to be done. My putting some of these "clarification" notes in is simply an attempt to motivate additional input by editors. In my opinion, this article could benefit from some discussion of specific examples that illuminate the very general discussion and history that the article already contains. I also note that parts of the article sometimes have lots of citations for very specific points, but then other parts of the article could benefit from citations, say, specific parts of introductory textbooks (the online Feynman lectures, perhaps, but others as well).

== several edits ==

I am responding to three successive edits by one editor, Editor [[User:Josophie|Josophie]], starting with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&type=revision&diff=682793175&oldid=682756406 this] one. I am responding here because there is a notice recommending talk-page response.

The edits are good faith edits, apparently intended to generally improve readability. As I read them, they do not purport to change the substance of their subject matter. As it appears to me, they are not based on their editor's new collection or surveying of reliable sources. Their editor has been active in making such edits in a range of articles. Their editor very recently made other edits to this page, upon which I commented just above, under the heading '''is 'conserved' not explicit enough?''' My comment did not receive a reply.

The first of the present edits is covered by this edit summary:

:::::revised definition of thermodynamics — prior one was too complicated

The prior wording was

:::::'''Thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[physics]] concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. It defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or [[radiation]].

The edit changed that to

:::::'''Thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that deals with the laws governing the [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] of a system, which may be described as the exchange of [[heat]] energy to and from other forms of energy within a system.  More specifically, it defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or [[radiation]].

I think the edit summary was misleading. I think the edit was deteriorative.

I think that will be enough comment from me for now.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 03:22, 26 September 2015 (UTC)[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 05:08, 27 September 2015 (UTC)

The new version is unsatisfactory in that it waffles with talk of "the exchange of [[heat]] energy to and from other forms of energy within a system." "Heat energy" verges on 'thermal energy', which is not a properly defined term in physics. The words also may too easily be read as implying that heat is a form of energy that is available for transfer. The new wording, contrary to the claim of its edit summary, is more complicated than what it replaces, with no added meaning.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 20:50, 28 September 2015 (UTC)

== faulty good faith edit to the first sentence of the lead ==

I wish to avoid editorial conflict, so I am going first to the talk page. Editor [[User:Spinrade|Spinrade]] has made a good faith edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamics&type=revision&diff=692487392&oldid=692160250 here], with the edit summary "Tighten up definition of thermodynamics". The newly offered first sentence of the lead is

:::::'''Thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that deals with the relationship between heat and mechanical, electrical, or chemical work.

This overwrites the former first sentence of the lead that read

:::::'''Thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[physics]] concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]].

I think this edit should be undone. First, it omits mention of temperature, which is highlit by [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim]]'s first chapter's first sentence "The most important conception in thermodynamics is temperature". Second, it lists "chemical work". Sad to say, there is no such thing as 'chemical work'. There is what is often enough called electrochemical work, but that is work that is work because it is primarily electrical, and secondarily has the qualification -chemical because the electrical factors are driven by chemical processes, which are always irreversible, contrary to a prime feature of work as it is often conceived. The definition of work requires that it be defined by forces outside the system. The chemical change is inside the system. Chemical changes are indicated by chemical potential and by mole number, which are often called "generalized work variables" because of how they appear in equations, but this does not justify a proposed notion of 'chemical work' as a kind of work proper. Work is a very fundamental notion in thermodynamics and it would be meddlesome and harmful to try to make out that 'chemical work' is a sound notion. Thirdly, newly offered list is incomplete because it lacks the generality of the former term [[Work (thermodynamics)]]. This formerly included term includes magnetic and gravitational work, and perhaps others, which are omitted, without good reason, from the new list. Fourthly, the edit also omits mention of energy, an important general notion for thermodynamics.

Thinking about this, I think the above reasons are sound, and I will therefore shortly undo the edit without waiting for debate.[[User:Chjoaygame|Chjoaygame]] ([[User talk:Chjoaygame|talk]]) 11:22, 26 November 2015 (UTC)
