== Grammar and intro ==
I'll say that you all have taken on a monumental task in explaining combinatorics, and I wish you much luck and skill. That said and wished, I'd like to point out a couple of things that seem to 'stick out' as in need of improvement.

[article quote] An example of a combinatorial question is the following: What is the number of possible orderings of a deck of 52 playing cards? That number equals 52! (fifty-two factorial). It may seem surprising that this number (80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000) is so big.

Anyone who has been introduced to factorials will hardly be surprised that 52! is so big. Thus, a reader might logically sense that this article will be addressed to people with little mathematical knowledge. But this article will probably lose all readers that know little of basic math. Beginners cannot be expected to know much about sequences and series, so in that respect, this article will require some seriously skilled and clever presentation to get the ideas across to the unknowledgable.

[article quote] He applied similar formulae for permutations with and without repetitions using the Arabic alphabet for illustrative purposes. He also does some work on combinatorial reasoning.

This is pretty bad English. A dead person 'does' nothing. The answer of course is that 'He also did or performed or pioneered something back then.'

There is some good material in this article but remember that the article leaves behind all beginners by the end of the introduction, so it might be best to not let the article suggest that beginners will be able to follow. I have no intention of editing the hard work of others here, but am happy enough to try to help by making suggestions. Peace.

: Hi, I recommend you read [[Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines]] before you post again in Talk. I've taken the liberty to add a header to your section.  In regards to your comments, I like the intro which mentions 52! as being a big number. It starts the article off in an interesting way, instead of plowing right into the maths. It makes the article more appealing to beginners. Nothing wrong with that. As far as the bad grammar goes, next time feel free to just make an edit. There's no point in bringing it up in Talk when its an obvious fix. --[[User:JRavn|JRavn]] <sup>[[User talk:JRavn|talk]]</sup> 21:56, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

== Algebraic Geometry ==

Perhaps mentioning the work of Rota connecting algebraic geometry to combinatorics would enrich this entry.  I don't know anything about it, in fact I ended up checking this entry to find out about this.

== Stomachion section ==

The following text was added by [[User:Gryspnik]] a few days ago.  While apparently correct (the links work, and seem to back up what's said), it was very out of place where it was put, so I've moved it here for later, better incoporation into the article. [[User:JesseW/sig|JesseW, the juggling janitor]] 18:59, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
:''Recently there was discovered that the work of Archimedes "Stomachion", believed to be lost, was the first work of Combinatorics ever written. A palimpsest discovered a few years ago, contains most of this lost work and involves finding the number of ways that the problem posed in the Stomachion can be solved. This game consists of 14 irregular strips of paper that can be placed in many different ways in order to form a square. There is additional information on this in the following links:
::http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040515/bob9.asp

You are right Jesse, I moved this info in the history section of combinatronics were it actually belongs. Thanks for that note.


== Formula Question ==

The formula for Combination with repetition seems somehow strange to me. It consists of three expressions whereas the last two seem odd. Inside the parenthesis they both have the same upper part (n+r-1) but different lower parts (r and n-1). Therefore, either r = n-1 or r = (n-(n-1) = 1) should hold, which I do not believe is always true. I already know the first expression (with r at the bottom) and think that it is correct – how about the second one? <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:141.51.122.97|141.51.122.97]] ([[User talk:141.51.122.97|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/141.51.122.97|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.</small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

:The expressions are all equivalent.  In general,
:<math> {{p+q} \choose p} = {{p+q} \choose q} </math>,
:because choosing ''p'' items (to keep) out of ''p''+''q'' items is equivalent to choosing ''q'' items (to throw away) out of ''p''+''q'' items.  Either decision amounts to partitioning the set of ''p''+''q'' items into two blocks, one with ''p'' items and one with ''q'' items.  For the formula for combinations with repetition, ''p''=''r'' and ''q''=''n''-1. [[User:Michael Slone|Michael Slone]] ([[User talk:Michael Slone|talk]]) 04:40, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Consistent Examples ==
I think the article might read better if we used the same example for each of four different methods, such as how many trigrams you can make from the first four letters of the alphabet. For permutations with repetition, it's 64; for permutations without repetition, it's 24; for combinations without repetition, it's 4; and for combinations with repetition, it's 20. A list of each of the sets of trigrams in questions might also be helpful, if it doesn't take up too much space. Thoughts? [[User:64.12.116.139|64.12.116.139]] 05:32, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

== rewrite of "Enumerative combinatorics" section ==

The biggest change I made was to put the recursive solution for the (n+2)nd Fibonacci number before the closed form solution.
This is because the recursive solution is used to solve for the closed form solution.  The recursive solution is not an alternative approach, it is the means to reach the end that is the close form.  Also, the initial conditions given were incorrect.  They were correct for the Fibonacci numbers, but since f(n) is in fact the (n+2)nd Fibonacci, the correct initial conditions are f(1) = F(3) = 2 and f(2) = F(4) = 3.

== Anglo-american playing cards ==

I changed "deck of 52 anglo-american playing cards" to "deck of 52 distinct playing cards."
For the mathematics to be correct (that the answer is 52!), the only relevant fact is that the 52 cards are distinct.
Most english-speaking readers will naturally think of a standard anglo-american deck.
However, if a reader is unfamiliar with this deck, I don't want that unfamiliarity to unnecessarily confuse him. [[User:Ptrillian|Ptrillian]] 22:51, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

==Quality==
I read the article and found it inadequate, very much incomplete, poorly written at times misleading and at times plain wrong.  I made few structural changes and hope others can add more material to these (very small) subsections.  I realize that in the current state the article may need a complete overhaul.  The idea would be to make it resemble [[Number theory]] which balances well links to deep parts with history and modern developments.  [[User:Igorpak|Igorpak]] 19:35, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:Let me be more specific in my concerns.  First, the article discusses at length many permutations, combinations etc.  This should be done on specialized pages.  Same for the Fibonacci numbers.  These examples should be removed (I wasn't brave enough to do that) and replaced by their general description within one paragraph os a small subsection.  Second, there is a great need to expand on the different types of combinatorics, especially graph theory and geometric combinatorics.  Figures would prove useful.

I've just noticed that on 21 Oct 07 [[User:Igorpak]], in his fairly substantial editing of the page, deleted a subsection describing the notational convention that creates symbols for sets based on enumerative expressions for their cardinality (e.g., 2<sup>''X''</sup> for the power set of ''X'').  I think that portion of the article was useful information, and I don't know in what other article it might be better placed.  What do others think?  Shall I restore the paragraph?  What about you Igor, what was your thinking?—[[User:PaulTanenbaum|PaulTanenbaum]] ([[User talk:PaulTanenbaum|talk]]) 02:09, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

: This has nothing to do with combinatorics, but rather a notation standard in [[set theory]].  It is as standard as addition or multiplication.  Surely, you don't want to explain this on every WP math page...  Anyhow, as I see it the page has a horrible quality, especially if you compare it with other fields of science like [[Biochemistry]] or [[Physical cosmology]].

== Why do we multiply? ==

In both the deck-of-cards example (52!) and the example of ''how many ways we can produce 4 groups of people, each of which consists of 5 people, out of total of 20 people'', the answer consists of multiplying together some intermediate terms. This is certainly correct, but I suggest that it may not be obvious to novices why we multiply the values instead of, say, adding them. This is sort-of addressed in the section ''Permutations without repetitions'' but regrettably the detailed example chosen involves 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 which by chance also equals 3 + 2 + 1.

Should the section ''Permutations without repetitions'' appear before ''Permutations with repetitions''? It seems simpler.

== Remove new extra examples? ==

I think everything in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Combinatorics&diff=236497148&oldid=235827777] should be reverted. There are multiple issues with it. It's written too much like a [[WP:NOTTEXTBOOK|how-to textbook]] instead of an encyclopedic article. The examples mix concepts instead of cleanly showing the concept in the heading like the original examples. I haven't seen the notation <math>{n\choose r_1, r_2, r_3}</math> before, and it's poorly explained with ''n'' apparently denoting two different things so it seems unclear whether 3 is supposed to be a fixed or variable number in the notation. The last added example apparently silently assumes that it matters whether the groups are swapped around. Otherwise the final result should be divided by the 4! ways there are to list 4 groups in order. If these examples stay then I think they need considerable work. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 15:36, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

: I agree with your assessment of the last example.  I actually noticed the same thing and was going to write a note here about it.  I will add the word distinguishable for now and hope for a discussion to occur on having these examples in the first place.  I believe it fits much better into the discussion of [[N_choose_k#Generalization_to_multinomials|multinomial generalization of binomials]].  The multiplication is equivalent to <math>{20\choose 5, 5, 5, 5}</math> and that article says the groups are distinguishable. --[[User:Cowsandmilk|cowsandmilk]] ([[User talk:Cowsandmilk|talk]]) 19:47, 3 October 2008 (UTC)

== How do you get 63? ==

If you start out with six tastes (e.g., six different spices which you can use singly or in combination with each other), if you mix two together you get 30 combinations (i.e., six choices for the first one times five choices for the second equals 30 different mixtures). If, as the text suggests, you mix three together, you get 120 different mixtures. So how did the ancient one arrive at 63, and why has no one questioned this before?

== The lead ==

The opening sentence in the lead has been stable for many years, but was a bit complex for anyone not familiar with the field. A recent edit attempted to fix this problem by replacing it with the statement that combinatorics is the mathematical theory of counting and citing it to an introductory probability text. I applaud the attempt, but it really goes a bit too far and leaves out major aspects of the subject, thus giving a false impression of the topic. This is understandable given the nature of the source, which I would not call authoritative, since the only aspect of combinatorics that is relevant to introductory probability is counting. To fix this I added the phrase "at its core" to indicate that while not incorrect, the statement was not complete, thus keeping the simplified form without giving the false impression. The next sentence would then have to say something about the broader definition, so I brought back the original sentence, slightly simplified. Another reason to bring back the sentence is that it contained the appropriate links to help make sense of the remainder of the paragraph and the rest of the article. A new problem now arises in that the simplified and broader definitions do not seem to be related (again, for a reader with no knowledge of the topic), so I added the phrase "in which counting is a primary tool" to make this connection clear. While my changes could perhaps be improved upon, a revert clearly needs to be explained and discussed. --[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 19:04, 26 October 2017 (UTC)

: I agree.  It is rather difficult to define combinatorics, as this page [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/papers/Quotes/Combinatorics-quotes.htm] suggests.  If one chooses a random probability textbook over authoritative quotes given there, please argue here.  Otherwise, let the page remain as in the stable version before.  [[User:Mhym|Mhym]] ([[User talk:Mhym|talk]]) 23:09, 26 October 2017 (UTC)

Perhaps I didn't make myself quite clear. I agree with the editor who felt that the stable version was too opaque. If I thought that returning to it was the best way to handle the situation, I would have reverted to it myself. I think that my revised version is better than either the stable version or the attempt by that editor. Of course there is no universally agreed upon definition, but an encyclopedia needs to give something that a reader can understand and that isn't too far off the mark. Throwing one's hands up in the air is not a good option. We might want to indicate the lack of agreement of a definition, but only after giving some skeletal outline of the topic. What I have suggested comes fairly close to the ''Princeton Companion'' treatment if it needs a pedigree. --[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 03:51, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

: I am fine with changing the lead, but do want to agree on a version here before the change is implemented.  I strongly disapprove the ambiguities like "at its core" which was in the recent version.  But I do think "geometric" was a good addition.  I am also fine with the old stable version.  Perhaps, you can propose a new version, post for comparison the Princeton Companion quote and we can start improving on that.  Hopefully we can reach a consensus.  Perhaps, other editors will join the discussion so it's not only the two of us.  [[User:Mhym|Mhym]] ([[User talk:Mhym|talk]]) 05:48, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Ok. I will do that, although, I'm afraid, given the nature of the beast, you are going to have to accept some ambiguity in the lead. If this could be done without ambiguity there would be a clear-cut definition of the field, which we know does not exist. --[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 17:20, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

: Right. Perhaps, it's better to start from scratch and make a somewhat vague but acceptable compilation version of some definitions on that page above, than try to make incremental improvements.  [[User:Mhym|Mhym]] ([[User talk:Mhym|talk]]) 20:02, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Here is a first pass. This is meant to replace the first paragraph. The Mazur quote is from ''Combinatorics : A Guided Tour'' and the Ryser reference is to ''Combinatorial Mathematics''.
{{hat|Version 1}}
<blockquote>
'''Combinatorics''', it has been said, "may rightly be called the [[mathematics]] of counting."<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc = pg. vii}}</ref> Few, however, would take this as a definition without a great deal of further amplification. Agreement on how this amplification should proceed is lacking and, according to {{harvtxt|Ryser|1963|loc=p. 2}}, a definition of this subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions. In so far as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with
* the ''enumeration'' (counting) of specified [[Mathematical structure|structures]], sometimes referred to as arrangements or configurations, associated with [[finite set]]s,
* the ''existence'' of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria,
* the ''construction'' of these structures, perhaps in many ways, drawing upon ideas from several areas of mathematics, and
* ''optimization'', finding the "best" structure or solution among several possibilities, be it the "largest",  "smallest" or satisfying some other optimality criterion.

Perhaps the easiest way to give an accounting of what combinatorics is, is to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques as is done below. However, even this approach is not completely satisfactory since it does not capture the purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella.

Although primarily concerned with finite sets, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, [[Countable set|countable]]) but [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] setting. This concentration on finite sets implies that techniques used in combinatorial arguments are more likely to be drawn from [[algebra]] than [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].

: Let me try to edit this.  I kept much, but revised the first few sentences.  It is more dry and less eloquent perhaps but more direct and to the point, making it more useful perhaps.  I totally disagree with the last proposed lead sentence - much of Asymptotic and Arithmetic Combinatorics uses tools from Analysis, Probabilistic Combinatorics uses tools from Probability, etc.  There seem to be no sensible way to make this distinction correct and meaningful.

This looks good to me. A few copyediting changes and a modification of the first sentence of the second paragraph are all that I think are needed. We can reference Pak's quotations for the addition. I think that this added phrase (or its equivalent) is needed to bring clarity to why we are addressing the definition question in the way that we are. I don't think that there was anything wrong with the algebra statement, as I phrased it, considering that up until very recently combinatorics was dealt with by the NSF in its algebra section. However, this is not a deal breaker and I'll be happy to let it slide. --[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 05:07, 30 October 2017 (UTC)

As we seem to be converging on this change, let's try to get some other comments before finalizing.

:I think "finite sets" is too specific. There is certainly important work on the combinatorics of finite sets (e.g. [[Sperner's theorem]]) but most people would include graph theory (or at least the theory of finite graphs) in combinatorics, and although graphs can be represented as sets they are not the same thing as sets. I would prefer "finite structures", but then we should change "structural" earlier in the sentence to some other word. (Also, from the graph-theoretic perspective, I'm not entirely happy about the emphasis on counting — the enumerative combinatorics of graphs, while important, is a small part of graph theory overall.) —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 19:21, 30 October 2017 (UTC)
::Thanks David. I certainly include graph theory in combinatorics and your point is well taken. I think this is easily fixed. As to your issue with counting ... this could just be a matter of perspective. When I think of counting in this context, I have in mind more than just enumeration. I am thinking of it as a fundamental proof technique, and as such, it is pervasive in all of combinatorics, including graph theory. Just think of the handshaking lemma, Ramsey theory, and any proof that sets up a bijection between finite sets. Perhaps this vision needs to be <s>made</s> stated more clearly. --[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 20:51, 30 October 2017 (UTC)
::: Some comments:
:::* I agree with David about "finite structures."
:::* I think the grammar in the second sentence is broken; "and with" should be "and having", right?
:::* Can you say a bit about what is intended by the phrase "incorporating many tools and ideas"?  
:::* I am a bit unhappy with the mention of sociology in the lead, since it is not mentioned in the article body anywhere.
:::* I suggest moving the Ryser citation into ref tags rather than leaving it in-line.
:::* I feel like the end gets a bit essay-ish.

_____________________________________________________________

1) I am thinking "combinatorist" is old fashioned and should be deleted.  I tried [[WP:GOOGLE]] and found 50K for "combinatorialist" vs 2.2K for "combinatorist", many of which I am sure to this WP page and its mirrors.  I say we scrap this version.

2) I find "This approach is not completely satisfactory" to be overly negative.  I would put a positive spin on it, as in "To fully understand the definition one needs to see historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella. According to [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], "combinatorial theory has been the mother of several of the more active branches of today's mathematics, which have become independent", singling out [[algebraic topology]] as the most successful example." [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/hidden/papers/Quotes/Discrete-thoughts.pdf]
I tried to find a better link but failed.  I think it's a chapter of "Discrete thought" by Rota.  

P.S.  Now that I read [[algebraic topology]], that article includes a section "Notable algebraic topologists".  Maybe we also should have a section like that.  <small>[[:Category:Combinatorialists]]</small> has many, of course, but some of those are best known for work in other fields.

I like the Rota quote but it seems to me to be opening up a new topic that isn't addressed in the article, so I've left it out for the nonce.

:: 2)  It would be a good idea to preface "Combinatorics problems..." sentence with a sentence to the effect that combinatorics is well known for its problems.  Otherwise this feels like a logical jump between paragraphs.

:: 3)  I would like to have some quotes or at least citations right after "independent branch of mathematics in its own right." sentence.  I looked at the list of Pak's quotes referenced above.

:Sorry, I missed that. In optimization, what is considered to be "best" is problem/criteria dependent. This is in quotes, not because it is disputed but rather because it is variable ... there is no single meaning for the term and to not include the quotes would be misleading. --[[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 15:00, 16 December 2017 (UTC)
