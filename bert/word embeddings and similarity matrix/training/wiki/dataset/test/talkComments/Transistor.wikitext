:I presume that you are talking about discrete transistors on die.  I searched several semiconductor websites (not an exhaustive search by any measure) and did not find any.  All the discretes were in packages.  The only thing I found on die were integrated circuits.  When I think of a discrete transistor, I mean a transistor with a collector, base and emitter and nothing else.  A single transistor on a die would have, I think, a substrate.  I'm leaning to saying that is not discrete. [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 23:07, 21 May 2018 (UTC)
::No he is talking about discrete transistor dies.  He is confusing a die diced from a wafer having one transistor with an monolithic integrated circut die diced from a wafer and having many transistors.  A die as a single transistor has the exposed discrete three connections you expect (emitter, base & collector for bipolar or source, drain & gate for MOS).  Such die are typically connected by solder bumps. Whereas none of the many transistors in a monolithic IC ever exposes the three discrete connectors you expect, they are inconnected as part of the deposition process and are never discrete from a connection perspective. We don't build much these days with such discrete transistors but consider [[IBM_Solid_Logic_Technology|IBM SLT]] as one example - note the usage of the term "discrete transistors" in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Solid_Logic_Technology#/media/File:IBM_SLT_wafers.agr.JPG Steps in manufacturing Solid Logic Technology hybrid wafers]. The reason yr search didn't turn up any references is probably because there are no standards for transistor dies but they were used heavily in the 1960s and are still are available, see e.g. [https://www.fairchildsemi.com/products/die-wafer/|Die & wafer].  When a wafer is diced into individual transistors, they are discrete, it doesn't matter how they are subsequently packaged.

== Singular and plural die and dice ==

Unfortunately, both terms are sometimes used both as singular and plural, though dice as singular is just wrong except when referring to a game; a pair of dice is two, while each one is a die.  In [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=cut+into+die%2Ccut+into+dice&year_start=1960&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ccut%20into%20dice%3B%2Cc0 books], "cut into die" is not a thing, while "cut into dice" is common.  In reference to wafers, see [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22wafer+into+dice%22&source=lnms&tbm=bks&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX5YDR_pvbAhUkNX0KHfNqA74Q_AUIECgB&biw=1286&bih=601 this search], and [https://www.google.com/search?biw=1286&bih=601&tbm=bks&ei=SXMFW8LFMN2-0PEPl6eC0AE&q=%22wafer+into+die%22&oq=%22wafer+into+die%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...21883.21883.0.22629.1.1.0.0.0.0.87.87.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.b4qqGa7alw4 this search] (sometimes it's "wafer into die chips" or "into die sized pieces" just because die is so awkward as a plural).

An anon has been reverting with the claim that dice is singular and die is plural.  That's just backwards.  A better argument for reverting dice to die would be that die is preferred in this industry; but that's questionable. [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 14:02, 23 May 2018 (UTC)

:In my experience, "dice" can also be a verb: "dice the wafer". See [https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0132520A2 this patent], within the browser, search on "DICE AND PICK". The phrase refers to the operation where, after the wafer was tested, the wafer is sawn into dice (or diced) while attached to a plastic adhesive-coated sheet. Then a machine consults the wafer map, which shows which chips passed, and picks the good chips off the plastic sheet for further processing. The remaining chips are discarded.

:IEEE Std. 100 (7th ed), owing to some sloppy proofreading, is not our friend here.  The entry for "Die" says in part "...Note: this is the plural form of die. ... See dice".  The entry for "dice" syas in part "...Note:this is the plural form of die."  Perfectly ambiguous.  And authoritative, it says so right on the frontispiece. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 02:06, 24 May 2018 (UTC)

As far as the integrated circuit usage is concerned, Googling "Integrated Circuit Dice" turns up only three hits (ignoring Wikipedia) where all three words are present, and they are all links to the company 'Danube Integrated Circuit Engineering' (DICE).  However: Googling "Integrated circuit die" turns up pages of hits for the subject of this discussion. On this basis there does not seem to be any on-line evidence supporting the notion that integrated circuits are constructed on dice rather than die.

::Well found. I would make the observation that a patent is written by an individual (usually a patent clerk) and is not therefore an authoritative source on correct word usage in any context.

:::I feel judging by the number of Google hits can be very misleading. When a series of words are put in quotes, they must all occur in the order given, which greatly restricts the number of hits. I hypothesize that publications that delve deeply enough into integrated circuits to use the word "die" or "dice" would often not use the phrase "integrated circuit", but instead would use shorter words like wafer, chip, device, IC, etc.  If instead you google for the words <u>silicon dice</u> you get lots of hits; several on the first two pages support dice as the plural of die.

== Transistor aging compared to a vacuum tube ==

Is it really appropriate to include aging as a limitation in a section ''comparing them to tubes?''  In isolation it would be a valid concern but compared against a tube with almost infintiely worse long term reliability it becomes an advantage rather than a limitation.  I was tempted to simply snip that on sight but I figure I'll raise it here first, I know people can be hesitant to remove sourced material even if as here the source does not directly support the assertion made - the source does not even mention tubes.

== Things that are wrong ==

There are some things just plain wrong in this article.

For example, the MOSFET can not be regarded as constructed from two back-to-back diodes between source and drain. There's no PN-junction between drain and source at all. There is a parasitic diode between the substrate (bulk) and the /drain, however. This is normally reverse-biased, so that it does not conduct.

Moreover, CMOS is not a transistor type, it is a technology to combine both n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs on the same chip.

The description of junction FETs (JFET) is missing entirely.

== Origin of the word transistor ==

:The [[OED]]2 says "Blend of TRANSFER and RESISTOR". -- [[User:Heron|Heron]] 18:16, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)

The name 'Transistor' was selected by a ballot held at Bell Telephone Laboratories Incorporated. Here is a quotation from their Technical Memoranda, dated May 28, 1948 calling for votes:
 
' <u>Transistor</u>. This is an abbreviated combination of the words "transconductance" or "transfer", and "varistor". The device logically belongs in the varistor family, and has the transconductance or transfer impedance of a device having gain, so that this combination is descriptive.'

Other names suggested in the technical memoranda are, 'Semiconductor Triode', 'Solid Triode', 'Surface States Triode', 'Crystal Triode' and 'Iotatron'. (Is there a typo in the original memo: should 'Surface State Triode' have read 'Solid State Triode' ?) 

I got this from a scanned image of the original memoranda at:  'Bob's Virtual Transistor Museum & History' at: http://users.arczip.com/rmcgarra2/index.html  ---  [[User:CPES|CPES]] 22:55, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:We should clarify that it is transconductance varistor and not transresistor or transfer resistor or whatever.

== Big removed chunk ==

Someone removed this whole section:

:The diode's job in AM detection is the rectification stage, which is followed by the integration stage in the archetypal scheme.  Full-wave rectification is akin to the absolute value function in mathematics, but a single diode can do only half-wave rectification, where the signal is passed only if it is above (or below, depending on diode orientation) zero.  Not any old crystal would do.  It had to be 'naturally doped,' bearing impurities which would color the normally clear crystal.  

:The typical diode is called a PN junction diode, as it is an epitaxial arrangement of a P-carrier region and an N-carrier region.  Biasing the diode in one direction tends to separate the charge carriers, turning it off.  With the bias in the other direction, the carriers come together, allowing significant current to flow, provided a threshold potential requirement is met.  

:This potential, or 'bandgap,' is dependent on what type of material the diode is constructed of.  Typically, approx 0.6 V will make a silicon diode seem like a resistance of approximately 1 ohm.  When the electrons participate in this 'recombination current,' a fixed frequency of light is emitted, proportional to the energy (electrical potential) required to turn on the diode.  This is called 'discrete emission,' like in a neon tube (which is also monochromatic).  In silicon this frequency is in the infrared, which is too low to see.  GaAs has a 1.2 volt drop, and can be used as a red LED.  Germanium, which is fast but has lower reverse breakdown potential, has a typical drop of 0.3 V, even lower in the IR part of the spectrum.  

:A silicon Schottky diode also has about a 0.3 volt drop, half a typical silicon drop, plus a (much smaller) thermocouple-scaled drop, which is ignored.  These devices are also fast, but similarly feature a lower reverse threshold.  They are popular as protection circuits on the input of ICs as they turn on at a potential lower than ones that would damage the more expensive IC.  They are also popular in mixer circuits, which are used in 'superheterodyne' type radios (by far the most popular topology).  This is because of their low turn-on threshold, excellent matching, and low noise.  Here they are used in a sub-threshold mode to achieve a logarithmic (multiplying) transfer function.

== FETs ==

I have added a considerable amount to the [[FET]] page, which is linked from [[MOSFET]]. My feeling is that it would be a good idea to try to move the detail on FET and BJT operation out of [[transistor]] and to [[FET]] and [[bipolar junction transistor]]. I think that rather than explain the detailed FET and BJT operation here, it would be better to conceptually explain transistors as switches and voltage-controlled current sources (e.g. for amplifiers). I think particularly that the FET stuff here is largely a scatter-brained assortment of thoughts on subjects of varying importance (some of which I know nothing about) that perhaps belong in other articles. 

Some paragraphs seem randomly thrown in. Dubious accuracy, dubious relevance. [[User:Rmalloy|Rmalloy]] 15:52, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Voltage-controlled current sources are very confusing for some beginners.  They are allowing a specific amount of current to pass through them from the voltage supplies; not creating current themselves.  controlled resistors or even controlled current regulators would be a better description. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:50, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)

==Relative speeds of p vs n transistors==

:current into or out of the base is caused by the voltage across the base and the base's internal resistance.  the voltage across the base is actually from the emitter to the base.  yes voltage has to be between two points.  so a voltage from the emitter to the base causes a small current to flow from the base to the emitter.  this "opens up" the channel from emitter to collector and ''allows'' current from the supply to flow through it.

:i wish there were a good mechanical analogy for this.  there was a device in my car that worked similarly.  it has a diaphragm that controls a plunger that stops up a large pipe.  so a small vacuum at the diaphragm lifts up the diaphragm, which pulls the stopper out and allows a large flow through the other pipe.  this is like an FET.  the BJT version would have small holes in the diaphragm, so you need to constantly pull a small flow to keep the valve open. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:56, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)

::This is an [[EGR]] valve.  The vacuum line controls the flow of exhaust gas through another section of tube.

The one with small holes is like a BJT, because it needs a constant small flow of current to keep it open.  The difference between N-type and P-type can be compared to the difference between negative and positive backpressure EGR valves.

== Critical history missing. ==

What would be the best way of incorporating the following critical historical perspective into the Wikipedia writeup on the transistor?

According to witnesses at a lecture given by John Bardeen at the University of Illinois, Altgeld Hall circa 1978, when Bardeen thought he was in failing health, Bardeen stated that the trio of inventors were ordered to stop work on the transistor by Bell Labs management and had to ecome insubordinate to continue work.  [http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/potc.html Quoting Sherwin Gooch], one of the attendees to this lecture at Altgeld Hall:

''John Bardeen himself gave a talk one evening at Altgeld Hall on the University of Illinois campus, circa 1978, in which he related various experiences surrounding his inventing the transistor. At the time, people suspected that the scheduling of this presentation may have been related to Bardeen's health.''

''Professor Bardeen showed us the B&W 16mm film BB&S had made at Bell Labs immediately after they got the first transistor to work (and, presumably, before Bardeen's boss got to work the next morning...) I have seen individual frames and out-takes of this film since, but I don't know if the entire film still exists. The "rolly-cart" with their experimental set-up is plainly in evidence on the film.''

''It was John Bardeen himself, at Altgeld Hall, who related that his boss had said that the "solid-state amplifying device" which they wanted to develop was "not feasible," and that, "even if it were possible, it would have no practical application." Dr. Bardeen related that sometimes, when his boss stayed at work past 5 p.m., the three of them would become very impatient waiting for him to leave so they could roll their setup out of the coat-closet, and get busy on what they, apparently, thought was the greatest "cool hack" of the day.''

''I wonder who Bardeen's boss was. His boss should be immortalized in history next to the NASA manager who advised the last engineer withholding approval of the Challenger launch to "put on your management hat!"''

== billion transistors ==

Anyone got a reference to billion transistor chips? Pending that, I have "downsized" that paragraph to quarter-billion.  I'm not sure on exact numbers.
More importantly, I've removed the DRAM reference from here, because DRAM's have nowhere near as many transistors as that.  DRAMs use capacitors to store charge (approx 1 billion per chip these days) and only use transistors to boost this (and I would guess with only a few hundred thousand transistors).  [[User:Mat-C|Mat-C]] 21:28, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Here's one:
::''In fact, 1 billion transistors has already been reached in high-capacity DRAM memories. One gigabit is conventionally 1,073,741,824 bits, and each bit is stored using a transistor and a capacitor. However, the more demanding and prestigious milestone will come when a billion-transistor digital logic chip enters volume production.'' -- http://nwc.serverpipeline.com/technology/23900954
:If you need convincing that a DRAM cell consists of a capacitor and a MOSFET, see http://www.ece.umd.edu/courses/enee759h.S2003/lectures/Lecture2.pdf (sorry, it's a PDF, but it has lots of nice pictures). Or you could read our article on [[DRAM]]. --[[User:Heron|Heron]] 09:01, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== smd transistor for ups ==



== Transistor operation ==

I think it's useful to think of a transistor as a voltage or current-controlled resistor.  It's not that inaccurate.  I didn't understand them until I thought of it this way.  "Amplifier" or "voltage-controlled current source" are quite confusing for a newcomer. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 01:48, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)

Hi Omegatron. Thanks for comment. I take your point. Stangely, though, when I was learning about transistors I found the concept of thinking of a transitor as transferring a resistance misleading. It wasn't till I realised that the current in the collector is controlled by the current in the base/emmitter that things became clearer. The worring point to me about tranferring resistance is which resistance is transferred to where? The very nature of a transistor is that the collector current, to a first approximation, is constant, and is effectively independent of collector voltage, unlike a resistor. [[User:CPES|CPES]] 11:52, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, I know it's not accurate for calculation purposes, but it's a lot better for complete beginners to think of it as a controlled switch first, and then as a controlled variable resistor, and then they can learn the exact behavior.  Telling them its an amplifier or current source will confuse them a lot, trying to figure out how a transistor generates current.  I think the term "voltage- or current-controlled current regulator" might be the best?  We should be discussing this on the transistor talk page, probably.  - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:35, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)

You're right: a complete beginner or even someone just getting an overview of transistors may have a problem with current transfers and how that would work. Also, later the article does expand on transistor operation so anyone wanting to dig a bit deeper can get a more detailed explanation. I felt so strongly about 'transferring resistance' that I originally put in a statement that the concept of transferring resistance would not be helpful in understanding how a transistor works. This was later removed. When I was learning about these odd new devices, way back when tubes (valves) were king, we went through 'h' parameters and all that stuff, but like some of the above contributers I didn't really understand the basic operation and the DC conditions, especially as we normally focused on the grounded base configuration. Your term 'current controlled current regulator' sounds good (no mention of resistance). I hope there is no mixing this up with PSU regulators though. Would you like to update the Tran section? If you would like me to do it let me know. Regards --[[User:CPES|CPES]] 17:10, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:well, is there a better word than "regulator"? we need to convey that it allows a certain amount of current (without "causing" that current.  it's just allowing the power supply to cause the current).  regulator might get confused with a filtered power supply or something.   - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:26, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)

:current "gate"  "valve"?

I can't think of a good noun phrase to describe the BJT. Also there is the complication that both BJT and FETs are covered on the Tran page. This is part of the problem with the existing introductory definition. The best I can come up with is to have separate descriptions for the two types of tran: BJT = 'device where the output current flow is controlled by the input current' and FET = 'device where the output current flow is controlled by the input voltage'. They are not the most elegant descriptions but at least they get away from any implication that current is generated or caused; it is merely controlled. It could then be explained that in each case the output current comes from the power supply. The existing detailed description about terminals etc could then be moved to the 'How do they work' section'. - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 19:44, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah.  Hence the "current- or voltage-controlled".  The <s>current</s> existing description is accurate, but doesn't convey "current wants to flow because of the pressure/voltage from the power supply, and the transistor acts as a variable valve to ''allow'' a precise amount of current to flow, based on its input current (BJT) or voltage (FET)"  just saying the current is "controlled" isn't quite enough.  It's "allowed"? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 20:24, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)

:Could say a simple way to think of it is a switch, which ''is'' accurate; they are used as switches all the time, and then move on to a "switch that varies smoothly from on to off"? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 20:25, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)

Your first definition captures the essence of transistors operation well. Unfortunately, 'valve' can mean vacuum tube in the UK, but this shouldn't be a big problem. Using your words, how about: " A transistor acts as a variable valve which, based on its input current (BJT) or input voltage (FET), ''allows'' a precise amount of current to flow through it from its voltage supply. - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 22:46, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:That's very good.  I put it in. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:26, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)

:I still want to add resistance though.  :-)

"It acts as a variable valve which, based on its input current (BJT) or input voltage (FET), ''allows'' a precise amount of current to flow through it from the circuit's voltage supply, '''effectively by varying its output resistance'''." - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:34, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)

:Your intro reads pretty good to me as it is, but if you think that a mention of resistance is important: go ahead. At least it will say 'effectively'. Regards [[User:CPES|CPES]] 15:25, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

But but but...  BJTs are voltage controlled devices!  There is no physical mechanism that lets the Ib directly exert control of Ic.  Instead, the Vbe is the main input signal, and the value for Vbe controls both the small base current and the large collector current.  Sure, if you want a simplified rule-of-thumb mental model, it's best to imagine that Ib controls Ic directly.  But if we want a physics explanation, we must point out that Vbe controls the width of the BE depletion layer... and this depletion layer is what controls Ie.   Ib is then determined by the shapes and doping of the B and E regions (i.e. how much of carrier population coming from Emitter will be intercepted by opposite carriers in the Base.) --[[User:Wjbeaty|Wjbeaty]] 20:32, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)

:your point is an interesting science VS engineering type problem.
:the physisist would say: when we vary the base voltage it controls both base and collector currents.
:the electronic engineer would say: when i change the base current the collector current changes, the change in the base voltage is negligable.
:BOTH are correct they are just approaching from a different POV. [[User:Plugwash|Plugwash]] 03:22, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Both aren't correct.  Sure, Ic=Ib*hfe describes how a transistor behaves, but if we wish to explain *how* the base current controls the collector current, we have to come clean and admit that Ib cannot control Ic.  Instead, transistors rely on small changes in Vbe.  They're not as insignificant as they seem, instead they're the whole basis of transistor operation.  Most textbook authors don't seem to know this, and most BJT explanations end up as misguided attempts to show how Ib controls Ic.  
::(And as a double-E myself, I'm very familiar with the engineer POV which says "I don't want to know how it actually works, just give me the SPICE model.")  grin. --[[User:Wjbeaty|Wjbeaty]] 05:07, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)

==Invention/history==

Suggest that the 'Invention' section would fit well in the 'History' section. At the moment it just seems to pop up in the middle of the physical/technical stuff. Or would 'Invention' be better after or even before 'Origin of name' ?  -- [[User:CPES|CPES]] 01:24, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I have moved title 'Invention' to be below 'Origin of name'. Also title 'How transistor works' to above 'How semiconductors work' where it seems to fit logically.  -- [[User:CPES|CPES]] 20:46, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Now, I have moved 'Invention' to be above 'Origin of name' It seems to fit better there: first Bell invented tran and then they needed a name for it. (Wiki has sorted itself out now and is firing on all cylinders) - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 01:31, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Images==

I moved the SMD image to be with 'Types' where it is covered by the text. This complies with Wiki style (image size clash) and also gives a bit more 'colour' to the text lower down.

The 3 current images of transistors (thru hole, smd & 2* power on h/s) look good, but some some humans would be nice: there is a good image of the three people tran developmet team on the net which would fit in well with the 'Invention' or 'History' sections. The standard image of the first tran would be good too, say with 'History'. On the technical side, the tran elec symbols are missing. Suggest a single graphic image of: npn bjt, pnp bjt, p chan igfet, n chan igfet, p chan igfet, n chan igfet (both igfets without parasitic s/d diodes). Also suggest that the symbols be in line, stretching across the width of the page. Where to put it though: perhaps under 'Types' and move smd image to 'Minaturisation'.  Although I can generate the tran symbols image, as a Wikirookie I feel a bit nervous about uploading images, especially as Wiki is a bit fractious at the moment. If ok I may have a go when things settle down.  -  [[User:CPES|CPES]] 20:09, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Humans?  What are those?  :-)
:I got the schematic images uploaded already I think. I'll link 'em. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 01:23, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)

I'm not sure what they are. I think there are two types of humans: P type and N type, but I never worked how you can tell the difference- I'm just a techi. Look forward to seeing the tran symbols though. (the system seems to have caught up with events now) - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 01:52, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't; I was thinking of wikibooks, but I made a new one:

[[Image:Transistor symbols.png]]

I'd like to make a single picture that has EVERY possible symbol so people can figure out what they are looking at easily.  Or else make one for each kind and table them together for easier editing?  I can arrange them however we want, flip them, etc.  These already exist:

[[Image:IconsMOSFET.png]]
[[Image:IconsBJT.png]]

And these on the french wiki:

[[:fr:Image:Transistor_mosfet.png]]
[[:fr:Image:Transistor npn.png]]

And probably should include all of these:

: The symbols look good on the tran page. I don't like to be picky, but suggest the sybols for the IGFETs should be the ones now used in the U.S. and U.K. as in the International Rectifier FET data book for example. I can't draw them on Wiki at the moment but they only have three connections (like the physical IGFET) and they have a 'bent gate line' with the connection comming out of the circle adjacent to the source. Also three short lines on the D/S side, the source being internally connected to the two lower short lines and the drain being connected to the upper short line. Be nice if they could be added to the present image on the tran page. I like the way you have kept the symbols organised so that all poitive terminals are at the top. - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 02:26, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::I meant I was going to include every possible symbol, including more than one symbol for each type if there is more than one, so that we can serve as a reference for all the confused engineers who don't know what all the little broken lines mean.

:::agree that we should include ALL symbols for a transistor type. That link on fr is broken. im SURE that it is technically possible to have a seperate bulk connection on an igfet though few practical discreet devices do.

(4am local + pressure from high power n type human = errors) Thanks to [[User:Plugwash|Plugwash]] for sorting out. I'm not with images yet. Agree that substrate can be brought out of case as a separate terminal but, as you say, on nearly all igfets the substrate and drain are internally connected. Therefore, to keep it simple suggest we show just the two symbols with sub/drain connected and perhaps explain in text about independant substrate and use same approach for parasitic diode betweem s/d. There has been a lot of confusion with various igfet symbols in the past and I feel that if we show too many symbols it might cause confusion rather than help. This is particularly true when the symbol itself doesn't show graphically any difference between the drain and source. I will see if I can get the 'good' IGFET symbols to you in some way. - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 11:43, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Well we don't want to get too in-depth explaining details about each type in the main article.  We'll leave that for the smaller articles.  But I am imagining a section called "schematic symbols" or something, and it will have a table with all of the symbols in it and clickable captions underneath each that go to the appropriate articles.  I think showing more symbols is better than less. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 17:18, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)

"Did I?  So BJTs are flipped to stay the same polarity, but JFETS have the drain and source on the same side regardless of polarity?"  NO, I just noticed: the P chan JFET symbol is the 'right' way up but the source and drain idents on image are wrong: they are swapped. Arraagh, also noticed another point: suggest that P chan JFET should be at top of image to be opposite PNP BJT. This would be more consistent and less confusing; the P chan JFET being the same 'sex' as the PNP BJT.  - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 00:38, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

(This comment is out of sequence; It was blocked by the entry of above)
Agree that having a separate page with a load of symbols would be the best so the main page is not too busy. That way we could put in symbols for darlington, IGBT, arrays, etc. But to me, also keeping a simple image showing the basic 6 symbols on the tran page would still be best. But, I really would like to see the more modern IGFET sybols, as on IR data sheets, put on the main page. We could show the other IGFET symbols on the new page (and perhaps warn that if you use them you are liable to cause confusion on your circuit diagrams. We could also say that if you are reading an existing circuit diagram with these symbols, you will just have to work out for yourself which end is the sorce and which end the drain). - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 02:28, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Vacuum tubes==
The article mentions the advantages of transistors over vacuum tubes, but not the other way around. I believe there still are applications where vacuum tubes are preferred over transistors, like high fidelity audio. At least until recently. I don't know if there has been such advancement in transistor technology that maybe vacuum tubes are not used anymore at al where they can be replaced by transistors.([[User:MrDeBeuker|MrDeBeuker]] 19:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC))

:You understand that the concept that vacuum tubes are better for audio than transistors is basically a religious belief, right? That is, it's supported by faith but basically no evidence any more. See [[Audiophile]] and [[High-end audio]].

:On the other hand, tubes probably still are better if you're trying to design equipment that will survive [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]; that's about the only place I can think of (besides highly-specialized tubes such as [[Cathode ray tubes|CRTs]], [[magnetron]]s, [[klystron]]s, and [[Travelling wave tube|TWTs]]) where tubes still have any edge at all over solid-state electronics.

:The big difference is that tube amps tend to "soft clip" as  you drive them to their limit whereas transistor amps tend to hard clip; that is, the transistor amps operate linearly right up to the point where they don't but in tube amps, the gain rolls off as you drive near the limits, rounding off the clipping waveform. In this way, when they're both driven into the clipping region, tube amps produce a lot fewer harmonics. But why drive either into clipping, ehh? :-)

::It is more "preference" than "faith" if one prefers the sound of tube audio. If I prefer chocolate to vanilla, I don't see how that is "faith." The harmonic distortion modes are different. Then there's the old saying "Transistors hiss, tubes hum." There's also the notion that recordings in the tube era were doctored to sound good when played with tube amplifiers through big bass reflex speakers. When played through more "accurate" equipment, they might therefore not sound as good.[[User:Edison|Edison]] 16:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

::: The differences in harmonic distortion content are unrelated to vacuum tubes vs transistors; they depend on topology.  Tubes just tend to be used in asymmetrical class A more often than transistors.  Likewise with "hiss" noise levels and ground loop hum. 
::: All of these differences are a non-issue, anyway, if the sound is not run into clipping and the amplifier is designed well enough to have inaudible distortion/noise/hum, which can be done with either device. — [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 17:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== Removed from page (sound of tubes)==
''All This stuff has been removed from the page because:
A) This text is not about transistors
B) page is about transitors and not transitor amplifiers.
C) page is not about audiophiles or how transistors sound''

Some argue that the larger number of electrons flowing in a vacuum tube behave with greater statistical accuracy, although this ignores the fact that vacuum tubes generally have a high-impedance control terminal (grid), and that discrete transistor circuits (as opposed to integrated circuits) can also be designed to use large currents. 

Others detect a distinctive "warmth" to the sound. The "warmth" is actually distortion caused by the vacuum tubes, which some audiophiles find pleasing.  This is "soft-saturation" which occurs when vacuum tubes are [[overdriven]], causing poorly designed vacuum tube amplifiers to sound better than poorly designed transistor amplifiers. Tube amplifiers are also less prone to [[Slew rate|slew-rate]] limiting, which was a problem with early semiconductors and is still observed in low-cost transistor audio amplifiers.

Above speculative opinion gives no correlation between characteristics or measurements and perceived sound quality.  See [http://milbert.com/tstxt.htm Tubes vs. Transistors - Is There An Audible Difference?] and [http://www.milbert.com/TVTFC.bdc Transistors vs. Tubes - Brief Feature Comparison].

Vacuum tubes are also preferred in [[instrument amplifier|guitar amplifiers]] which are designed to be overdriven, because they have a different non-linear transfer characteristic than transistors, and create a different, more pleasing spectrum of harmonic distortion or "fuzz".  [[Digital signal processing]] (DSP) can be used to achieve similar effects in the digital domain.

('''single-ended transformer coupled''' to '''push-pull transformer coupled''' to '''push-pull capacitor coupled''' to '''push-pull direct coupled''').
DSP
Recently, inroads have been made in [[digital signal processing]] (DSP). DSP is a technique that can (among other things) be used with [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D]] and [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A]] converters to allow a digital processor (along with a computer program) to manipulate analog signals.

== Tran Advantages (over Tube)==

"though this is usually a desirable part of the sound of guitar amplifiers" There are many valve characteristics that contribute to the "valve sound" both for guitar amps and hi fi amps (valve amplifier topology also has a major influence). But the modulation of the valve characteristics by vibration is not a significant or consistent one. In some layouts the valve amp can be physically isolated from the speakers but this does not affect the sound. In fact valve manufacturers go to great lengths to minimise vibration effect and they often do this in different ways giving different characteristics. (Russian EL34s compared to Mullard EL34s).

Also statement "and can take advantage of the higher electron mobility in a near vacuum" is not really a main advantage but more of a tube design aspect which is not visible to the user as an advantage.

==Cost in $==
It looks like this page has been trimmed, so I didn't want to add to it without discussion. I'd like to see a bit of information relating to cost.

== Ending of initial paragraph is very inaccurate ==
It says "... allows a precise amount of current to flow through it from the circuit's voltage supply."
I would recommend to replace "precise" with something like "substantial" or "significant". 
Using "precise" is completely wrong because in fact every individual transistor is very imprecise, and it's parameters vary widely from sample to sample, and with temperature. An electronic circuit can be made precise if a certain combination of transistors is used (like OA, operational amplifier) having high amplification but with a deep negative feedback loop. - apredtechenski, Sept 06, 2005

===Substantial gain===

Someone asked in the article "what doees substantial gain mean"?  I believe the answer is that it means gain that is greater than 1 by an amount sufficient to convince the experimenters that they are observing actual active amplification.  It can be voltage ratio or a current ratio or a power ratio, but in general gain is the ratio of output to input, and you don't get gain greater than 1 from electronic components that are passive, or not active.

:Whatever, if you really want to keep the word I won't make any fuss.

=== Bipolar Name ===

Currently the BJT para says that they are so called because they use both majority and minority carriers. Minority carriers are unwanted leakage (ref Amos). Majority carriers (holes & electrons) are the bits you want. This is what is said about the name from some place on the interweb: "because the controlled current must go through two types of semiconductor material: P and N." I think this is right.  - [[User:CPES|CPES]] 22:13, 27 April 2006 (UTC) (80.177.169.33)


: I don't really understand what you say here. In a bipolar transistor, conduction is done using both type of carriers, electron and holes. Which is minority and which is majority only depends on the type of semiconductor material. I can't see any relation to the leakage current. Have I missed something? - [[User:CyrilB|CyrilB]] 18:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

:: It's too simplified. Actually, see, [[Bipolar_junction_transistor#Basics_of_transistor_operation]], or how it's explained in Russian Wikipedia: [[:ru:Биполярный транзистор|Bipolar transistor]]:

:: In active mode, voltage is applied to transistor so, that its emitter junction is shifted in forward direction (is open) and collector junction is shifted in reverse direction. For clear explanation, let's consider NPN transistor; all the reasonings are valid for the case of PNP transistor with substituting the word "electrons" for "holes" (and conversely) and also reversing signs of all voltages. In NPN transistor, electrons, the majority carriers in emitter, pass through open emitter-base junction in the region of base. Part of this electrons recombinates with majority carriers in base (holes), part of electrons diffuses back into emitter. However, due to the base is made very thin and (very?) low doped, the main part of electrons, injected from emitter diffuses into region of collector. Strong electric field of reversly shifted collector junction captures electrons (note that they are minority carriers in the base, so the junction is open for them) and carries them in collector. So, collector current practically equals emitter current, except for small loss for recombination in the base, which produces base current (I<sub>e</sub>=I<sub>b</sub>+I<sub>c</sub>). Coefficient α, relating emitter current and collector current (I<sub>c</sub>=α I<sub>e</sub>) is called "transfer coefficient of emitter current"(????!). The value of coefficient α equals 0.9 — 0.999; the more the coefficient the better the transistor. This coefficient poorly depends on voltages at collector-base and at base-emitter. So in the wide range of operating voltages collector current is directly proportional to base current, the coefficient of this proportionality being equal to β=α/(1-α)=(10-1000). Thus, changing low current of base the considerably larger collector current may be managed.

===Semi-Conductor vs. Conductor===
	On an atomic level, the difference between a conductor and a semi-conductor is in the number of electrons. Every atom has several orbitals, or paths that an electron follows, going around the nucleus of the atom. Each orbital has a certain maximum capacity of electrons that can follow that path. When an orbital that can only hold five electrons has four electrons and an electric charge gives it two more, it will try to pass one of them on to the next orbital or the next atom. A conductor atom has all of its orbitals full, making it pass on charges easily and without the loss of any electrons. A semi-conductor does not have all of its orbitals full which means that unless a certain minimum charge is sent through it, it will not pass the electrons to the next atom.

My alternative simplification would be that...

On an atomic level, the difference between insulator, semi-conductor and conductor is the energy required to promote an electron into the [[conduction band]]. In conductors, no energy is required, each atom is already contributng at least one electron to a "sea" of electrons which slosh about freely in the material. In insulators, a very high energy is required, typically the material has all electrons strongly bound to the atoms and unavailable to move. In semi-conductors, the [[band gap]] of the material is such that thermal energy is sufficient that some electrons become available for conduction. The inclusion of impurities or [[doping]] with atoms with a different [[valency]] provides sites which donate extra electrons or holes (a lack of an electron where one would be expected) to modify the conductivity of the material.

[[User:NeilUK|NeilUK]] 09:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

=== Band gap===
"The band gap is highly temperature dependent, decreasing with increasing temperature." part erased: the energy gap is always the same. What changes with temperature is the probability to cross the gap. [[User: 129.13.186.1]]

The above correction is from tran history and makes a very good point. I have read that the band gap varies with temperature. It also says this on Wiki [[band gap]], so this needs to be sorted. I have changed the "Semiconductor material" sub section to cover this aspect. [[User:CPES|CPES]] 12:38, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

The band gap varies with temperature, but very little, and this is an almost insignificant contributor to changing conductivity.  As stated above, the most significant factor is the ability of the carriers to cross the gap. [[User:Phil Holmes|Phil Holmes]] 15:34, 19 August 2005 (UTC)


=== Proportional current? ===
Im worried about the phrase 'allows a proportional current to flow'. In fact the current is not proportional to the voltage in a BJT but prop to the '''exp''' of the voltage. So this lead para needs rewording. Any suggestions?--[[User:Light current|Light current]] 01:09, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

I rewrote that sentence. [[User:Snafflekid|Snafflekid]] 05:28, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

The basic problem, which is currently not emphasised, is that BJTs and FETs operate in different ways. You push some current into the base of a BJT and more current flows thru the E/C terminals. On the other hand you put a voltage between the source and gate of a FET and it conducts a proportional current between the source and drain. In both cases this current flows regardless of the e/c or s/d voltage (provided that the e/c or s/d voltages are above saturation). Simple as that. [[User:CPES|CPES]] 02:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC) (80.177.169.33)

: Not exactly. BJT [[transconductance]] (ratio of C-E current to B-E voltage) is exponential, whereas FET transconductance is parabolic. Neither one is really proporional in input voltage. Sure, BJT collector current is more or less proportional to base current (beta), but it's highly variable based on temperature, current, and even individual device. BJT circuits are usually not designed based on a specific value of beta, you can't depend on it. One a specific die, two devices will have the same beta, but it's hard to control. Conversely BJT circuits are designed based on [[transconductance]], which you can depend on. FETs are a real problem, their transconductance can vary by a factor of two or more for a given device. Take a look at the specs for the venerable MPF102. IDss and Vgs(off) vary widely. As for pushing a current into G-S of an FET, you can use your imagination ;-) [[User:Msiddalingaiah|Madhu]] 22:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)



=== Transistor biasing-The most basic question ===
Why is the base-emitter junction of the transistor forword biased and the collector-base junction reverse biased?Why not the other way round?

If the BJT is used in the forward active mode (which is almost always the case) the collector voltage is higher than the base voltage and the base voltage is higher than the emitter voltage. For an N-P-N you get the condition you mentioned.  If the collector is pulled low enough it will become forward biased also, this is called saturation. [[User:Snafflekid|Snafflekid]] 17:22, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

: If you biased the B-E and C-B junctions as mentioned by the original (anonymous) poster, the collector and emitter terminals would be reversed (more or less). This does work, but not very well. In normal configuration, if the B-E junction is not forward biased, no current will flow into the base and no transistor action will result. Transistor action is not necessarily intuitive, that's part of the reason why BJT discovery was more experimental than theoretical. FETs are more intuitive, but fabrication was harder in the early days. [[User:Msiddalingaiah|Madhu]] 23:46, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

Well, in an npn BJT, the emitter is usually heavily doped n-type compared to the collector. This is to optimize the forward-active operation of the BJT. So, for a non-optimized BJT (which are rare), your question would be valid.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.225.195.234|69.225.195.234]] ([[User talk:69.225.195.234|talk]]) 03:29, 17 January 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::::The OP's concern is a lot easier to voice than to solve.  I've tried for a while to think of a one-liner that simply and adequately explains what a transistor is and/or does.  I don't really think there is such a thing.  Transistors can be simple devices, but the principles that govern their operation are not readily accessible to the lay man (high school level electromagnetics are a minimum requirement, basic quantum mechanics and solid-state physics are preferable).  Complicating things further is the fact that devices which work in very different ways (say, a BJT and a FET) are all lumped into the category of "transistor".  The lead of this article as it currently stands is decent, but I'm not too sure if I like the whole "small signal controlling larger signal" general assertion.  I think that this is usually true from an application point of view, but I can think of counterexamples (e.g. follower stages in amplifiers).  It's on the right track, but I think it could be improved some.

:::::No such luck...  All of my texts avoid actually defining a transistor and just start talking about how they work.  I looked at a copy of Britannica, and it adopts a purely functional definition of the transistor.  Rather than attempting to explain at the outset "what transistors do", it starts with "what they are used for".  I think this might be a very good approach.  Pursuant to this methodology, I think an adaptation of the first sentence in the second paragraph might be good.  Let's try to think of the most general categories of application transistors can be used for...  Off the top of my head, I'm coming up with signal '''amplification''' and '''control''' (switching, voltage regulating).  I'm a little hesitant about including oscillators so explicitly, since an oscillator is much more a certain circuit topology than a device.  I realize that this is somewhat an artificial distinction that could just as well be applied to any use of a transistor, but I think it's much easier to make the argument that a transistor can, on its own, behave as an amplifier or a switch than an oscillator.  Anyway, let me know what you think. -- [[User:Matt Britt|mattb]] <code>@ 2006-12-25T22:34Z</code>

::It's a solid-state alternative to a controlled valve (using the British meaning of valve). [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] 16:16, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:::You could go that route, but I don't think it's a particularly useful comparison for introductory purposes.  Someone who doesn't have a good grasp of transistors will not likely understand valves (tubes) well enough to benefit from the one-liner.  If we're talking about the hydraulic analogy of circuits, yick...  Let's not go there, please.  I'm still not entirely sold on the "small signal controlling larger signal" statement.  I certainly see the logic behind saying that, but I'm not convinced that it's the best way of summarizing transistor operation.  I don't think it neatly covers the switching role of transistors, and I still think it's awkward to apply it to unity or sub-unity amp stages.  I feel that a terse statement to the effect that "transistors are semiconductor devices used for electrical signal amplification and control" would be a nice way to cover all the bases.  If you folks really want to stick with the small signal/large signal explanation, however, I guess that's okay too. -- [[User:Matt Britt|mattb]] <code>@ 2006-12-27T21:12Z</code>

The opening is still vague and obtuse.  Given that transistors replaced vacuum tubes, is it fair to say that they perform the same function?  If so, perhaps you can use some of the narrative from the vacuum tube description, which is clearer to me:  
"In electronics, a vacuum tube, electron tube (inside North America), thermionic valve, or just valve (elsewhere, especially in Britain), is '''a device used to amplify, switch, otherwise modify, or create an electrical signal by controlling the movement of electrons'''..."

=== Clear lay presentation ===

This article seems poorly organized. Above all, there is no early, clear description of the basic mechanism by which, for example, NPN and PNP transistors work, suitable for a lay person.

===Pictures===

Currently there are two images of thru hole trans, both essentially showing the same thing. The original image (with tape measure) is best, because it shows a progressive size range and indicates scale. Suggest image presently in intro be removed and "tape measure" tran image be moved to intro.  An image of surface mount trans would compliment the thru hole image: there once was one but it seems to have got lost in the major revision of tran page.

== Types ==

This section is becoming more a laundry list than an informative and useful bit of prose.  I don't see much utility in enumerating every major variation of transistor.

I think that a distinction needs to be made here between distinctly different operating types (as in bipolar, FET, UJT, etc.) and differences in manufacturing processes, which have had very little relevance to me as a _user_ of the parts over the years.

===Photo transistors===

Now that the weird "photo fet" has been pointed out, we really need a section on photo-transistors to explain a bit about how these things work, and why the "photo fet" is a sort of bastard stepchild of a photo-transistor (OK, maybe not in those terms).  Here's [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3540666621&id=UhSTYaWN2bUC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=photo-fet&sig=NnKkjcMiiL2Xhe2C3wQ4jDTzzfM one explanation].

:Gracious that second book looks pretty old...  The wording makes it seem like it was written before the interaction of photons with semiconductors was well understood.  Anyway, as I've seen the term used, "phototransistor" can include a lot of fairly different devices.  The only real constant is that there's some sort of quantum interaction between photons and EHPs going on in a semiconductor.  Beyond that you could be using a heterojunction system, a MOS system, a traditional bipolar system, etc.  That's the reason I objected to the phrasing of the added text; it suggested to me that phototransistors all use photon-related RG current in exactly the same way, which isn't true. -- [[User:Matt Britt|mattb]] <code>@ 2006-10-30T16:16Z</code>

Yeah, 1989; ancient history; oops, no, I made a light-sensing NMOS chip in 1980; Chamberlain did in 1968; of course, the photosensitive parts were the isolation diodes, not the transistors.  My point is that in the photo-fet, the light doesn't make the transistor conduct, or not in a way analogous to the inherent transistor action on photocurrent that you get in a BJT.  A few words to explain the two, and their difference, could be useful. [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] 16:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

====Reason for reversion====

The following two paras were reverted out of the tran page with the edit comment below:

Photo BJT

"Bipolar transistors can be made to conduct by light (photons) as well as current. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called phototransistors."

Photo FET

"Like bipolar transistors, FETs can be made to conduct by light (photons) as well as voltage. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called phototransistors."

Edit Comment

"phototransistors don't "conduct" photons (or voltage, for that matter); the photons cause RG current... Plus the effect isn't limited to bipolar transistors"

I can't understand the edit comment (putting aside the photo FET issue for the moment). Neither paragraph states that phototransistors "conduct" photons or voltage and neither paragraph says that the effect is limited to bipolar transistors... or am I missing something?

== ChrisnHouston's edits ==

Chris, I have problems with a bunch of your recent edits.  The new lead paragraph introduces an unsourced analogy, unnecessarily introduces FET-only terminology, confusingly uses the word [[Vacuum tube|valve]] which has another meaning in electronics, and proposes a modified theory of transistor naming.  Your linearity comments are way off base, since linearity is a property of a circuit, not of a transistor.  The harmonic distortion statement is unsourced.  You may have some good ideas here, so try again, more carefullly, with sources; for now, reverting all. [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 04:58, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

That analogy was added as a simplified way to understand the device.  Analogies are never perfect, or they wouldn't be analogies.  The source/drain/valve terminology refers to the faucet.  And vacuum tubes, transistors and faucets all share a common function of acting as valves.  Water was engineered long before electrons were, and much of the terminology was adopted through such analogies.  My effort was toward making the article far more easy to understand for anyone wanting to learn about the transistor.  You see potential in those efforts and instead of building upon it, your chosen course of action is to tear it down.  Curious.  And I'm sure you're well aware that amplification and switching are properties of circuits too (and not transistors in themselves alone).  If you were consistent in your approach to Wikipedia here, you would have deleted a lot more than just my contributions, especially seeing how there are only five references on the entire page presenting many dozens of statements.
An alternative Wikipedia strategy is one of incremental building, where if some bricks are seen to be crooked, you can tweak them straight and keep on constructing instead of knocking a whole wall down.  ...something you might want to consider next time you feel the desire to use anti-vandalism tools in response to contributers you see to have constructive intent.

I don't understand what people don't like about reporting that many consider the transistor to be the greatest invention of the twentieth century.  This is a sourced fact (the fact that many consider it, which leaves room of course for many to have other opinions as well).  There can be no doubt that it's true; probably each of us knows many people who if pressed to think about it would consider it to be the greatest, but that's not really the point; the point is that a book, a reliable source, reports it.

Hi Dicklyon,  rather than making the claim that this is the greatest invention etc, a better approach might be to let the facts of the transistor speak for themselves.  This looks to be exactly what [[WP:peacock]] advises against. I know it's referenced, but the reference you've used to back this claim up is pretty weak. It's a one liner (almost repeated verbatim in the article), itself without any corroboration, stated as a lead-in to a section on microprocessors in a management text. It doesn't report it in any sense; it states it for dramatic purpose.  [[User:Lissajous|Lissajous]] ([[User talk:Lissajous|talk]]) 07:39, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

:Hi all... I'll just add that citing anything as the "greatest" of its kind is a far too vague and subjective claim and of no real value, and therefore it serves no substantive purpose to note within an article that "many consider" something as the "greatest" anything -- greatest hit, greatest band, greatest show on earth.

:More appropriate perhaps would be to note that many historians of technology consider the transistor the most significant (or whatever the adjective) development in electrical technology in the twentieth century, if that's indeed the case and the assertion can be properly sourced; "greatest" simply has no meaning.

:Certainly I agree that we have no business making claims about something being the greatest; but reporting an expressed opinion, or a summary of expressed opinions, from a reliable source is a whole different matter.  And I did tone it down to what the source reports, namely "The transistor is considered by many to be one of the greatest inventions of the twentieth century."  This is true, and it's sourced; of course many also have other opinions about's the greatest invention, and this doesn't interfere with that.

The only quarrel I have with with "considered by many to be one of the greatest inventions" is the word "greatest"; is this not a "weasel word"?. There's simply no ''objective criteria'' for determining what is "greatest". Shouldn't such words be avoided even when quoting a reliable source? It seems to me that quoting a claim that something is "the greatest" requires further explanation, i.e., ''why'' does so-and-so make the claim "greatest". If that were included I suppose I wouldn't have a problem with it. But for what it's worth, "One of the most revolutionary inventions" avoids these problems. The assertion is self-explanatory, objectively true, well-sourced, and nonexclusive (i.e., it doesn't claim the transistor is THE most revolutionary invention). Cheers for the good work!

== wiring two diodes together ==

I tried to re-express the statement about you can't make a transistor by wiring two diodes together.  It's more clear, I think, to give some minimal conditions under which putting two pn junctions together will make a transistor, and that condition is that they share a semiconductor base region.  On a chip, you can indeed put a pair of lateral pn junctions next to each other, "wired" via a diffusion, and get a transistor, though this is not the typical way to get a good one.  [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 15:49, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

"Simply wiring two junction diodes together will not make a transistor" would probably be most easily understood and informative for someone who is just starting to learn electronics.</s> Retraction.

Most results in trying to understand what the inside of a transistor is like results in a simple diagram of 3 blocks, labeled N P N with wires attached to them.
There's a difference between the collector and emitter layers, but it's never illustrated clearly.
I took a transistor apart once, and found a metal plate with a tiny square of silicon embedded on it, with two metal tabs that, to my knowledge, had cat whiskers attached to the back side of the chip, But I couldn't see them as I was unable to remove the epoxy on the other side of the heat sink.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.156.21.27|24.156.21.27]] ([[User talk:24.156.21.27|talk]]) 21:34, 5 July 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

They're made by a process called photolithographic epitaxy (using photoresist) (try googling or google imaging for photolithography or "epitaxial transistor" and you will find pictures like this [http://www.circuitstoday.com/igbt-insulated-gate-bipolar-transistors] and [http://www.hitequest.com/Kiss/photolithography.gif]). The reason that process is used is because you can make a whole bunch at one time, i.e. mass produce, and that makes them inexpensive. 

The process is similar to making a (chemical) photograph, where there is a chemical reaction caused by light, which you control by projecting the light in a pattern. Imagine that you pour a special liquid plastic (called [[photoresist]]) onto a surface, and then expose it to light in a pattern, where the light will make the plastic get hard. Now you rinse away the liquid plastic, and you have left a hard plastic pattern that matches the pattern of the light (i.e. a picture of your face if you projected a pattern of light that looked like your face). Now pour acid on the surface, and the acid will etch the surface where there is no plastic; where there is hard plastic, the surface will be protected. Alternatively, instead of acid, you could "rain" or "snow" down a layer of something different, which would not stick to the surface where the plastic was. Alternatively, you could bombard the surface with chemicals that would cause a change to the substance of your surface (e.g. by adding + or - impurities to a crystal of a semiconductor), with other parts protected by the plastic. Now, scrape/dissolve away the hard plastic and you have constructed a complex pattern on your surface. You can now repeat these steps with a different pattern on top of the previous one, and build up several layers. Instead of your face, use pictures of transistors and voila, you have transistors.

I have found this article very unorganized and confusing.  While explaining that Transistors are electronic switches, and that are several types, in addition to the fact that they assemble into logic gates, etc., nowhere is there a simple encyclopedic description of what a transistor actually is in terms of physical functionality.  

There are claims that it underlies the basis of modern electronics, but no elaboration as to how.  As such I find the article overall very unhelpful from a novice/informational standpoint.  [[User:Commissar Mo|Commissar Mo]] ([[User talk:Commissar Mo|talk]]) 10:30, 5 August 2008 (UTC)

::There are two commonly used types of transistors (bipolar junction non-FET ('''BJT''') versus '''MOS FET'''), and they work completely differently, so one description will not explain both. It is not possible to completely understand how transistors work without quantum mechanics, but here is a "handwaving newtonian" explanation that will move you closer for a BJT. You need to already understand what electrons are, and what an electric field is: if you put a free electron into an electric field, the force of the field on the electron will make the electron move, the electron will accelerate, and the stronger the field, the more acceleration, after which the electron could be said to have absorbed power or energy. ''A BJT transistor has an electric field in it'', formed and increased when you reverse-bias (e.g. hook up a battery to) a PN junction (reverse bias makes the depletion zone wider, no electrons keep flowing, but you get a nice electric field sitting there). It is a real electric field, one that if we put a free electron in it, will cause the electron to accelerate. ''Now consider a microphone'': a microphone takes the pattern of energy in the vibrations of air (e.g. from your voice) and converts it to a pattern of electrons with energy that corresponds to the vibrations, but an energetically weak pattern of electrons. Now, if only we could sprinkle those microphone electrons into the electric field of this BJT transistor (I reject [[RAS Syndrome]]), they would be accelerated by the field, and if we sprinkled them in in the pattern of your voice, we could get a accelerated pattern of electrons in the same pattern as your voice but with a lot more energy, enough energy to move a loudspeaker in the same pattern to allow you to sing [[Never Gonna Give You Up]] (I just [[Rick Roll]]ed you) to a stadium full of people. Well guess what a BJT does (this is the quantum mechanics part), it allows us to '''emit''' the microphone electrons (across the forward biased junction which gives the weak energy electrons a little help) into that electric field, and on the other side of the field it '''collects''' them and hands them back to us, all acceleratey. That's why once the transistor was invented we have never given it up. The quantum mechanics part means that a transistor needs to be very small, because the cloud of microphone electrons needs to use quantum mechanical probability to magically jump a very short distance from the forward biased junction into the reverse biased one. Not all of the microphone electrons get there, but we add enough energy to the ones that do that we get a stronger pattern stream than we started with. Now in a jumble I will explain several more things you need to learn: multiple transistors can be used in stages if one transistor does not amplify enough (can't remember, one stage could amplify about 1000 times?); transistor amplification is not linear, but we can use negative feedback circuits to flatten it out; or we can push the nonlinear nature in the other direction and instead of smooth amplification we can switch transistors from "off" to "on" to make digital circuits representing 0 and 1.

The graph in question makes some sense with a reasonably valued collector resistor.

If  V<sub>CC</sub> could reach 0 (perfect closed switch) then I<sub>c</sub> can go no higher than V<sub>CC</sub> / R<sub>C</sub> even with higher base voltage and current.

The red graph shown here to the right is useful. It is a multiple trace overlay. 
The X axis is collector voltage. The Y axis is collector current. Each nearly horizontal red segment is for a fixed base current. 
This is the linear region. At each level of base current the collector current has a small dependency on collector voltage. That's why it's not perfectly horizontal. It's similar to the characteristic graph of a pentode tube. 
The nearly vertical part represents saturation, where the collector voltage is low and collector current current is much lower than I<sub>b</sub> X beta. Since saturated collector-emitter voltage rises with collector current this segment is not perfectly vertical.[[User:Circuitsmith|Circuitsmith]] ([[User talk:Circuitsmith|talk]]) 15:52, 13 July 2009 (UTC)


I'm assuming this graph has been removed?  This comment still refers to a graph which I can't see:

"It is important that the operating values of the transistor are chosen and the circuit designed such that as far as possible the transistor operates within a linear portion of the graph, such as that shown between A and B, otherwise the output signal will suffer distortion."

== Merging of 2N2907 and such ==

A list of some common models in each family and links to an electronics-specific Wiki for actual articles on them would make more sense than having separate articles for 2N3906/2N2907/2Nxxxx for the silicon PNP BJT family for example.  It would also be easier to manage and the content would be of higher quality simply because of the people drawn to such references.  It's really not so much encyclopedic as a lookup table and should really be in a project dedicated to technical references instead of general-audience content.  ("It's too complicated and also extremely redundant")  Not to mention that a database may handle such information in a more easily-accessed manner for those that need that information.

Rather trying to merge everything here, each article should be examined on its merits.  If there is more to say than simply repeating the devices data sheet (for instance, the history of the device) then it probably can be built into a Wikipedia article.

::::::Yes, some of those certainly seem to be mergeable, although I am not particularly familiar with them.  As well as the same basic type in different packages as pointed out above (although those would tend to have the same root part number) there are other ways families are formed.  Some types are made to be used as matched pairs of NPN and PNP transistors in Class B amplifiers, BD131 and BD132 are examples.  There are also families of basically the same transistor in different qualities: an example of this is BC107, BC108 and BC109 which all come off the same production line, but the higher gain ones have BC109 stamped on them.  This last family was at one time so ubiquitous as ''the'' low-frequency, low-power transistor that it certainly deserves an article.

:I think it is quite terrible that so many experienced editors (including myself) have got into an edit war over something so tangential.  The original edit was done by an IP who clearly was not aware of the guidelines and I reverted it purely on those grounds (that it was not referenced to the guidelines).  Everything else should have gone to the talk page first before any further editing.  Dicklyon, surely the article got into a mixed state because it had been added to by American editors after it had been started in a British spelling system.  Someone coming along and arbitrarily picking a spelling system without consensus is no more acceptable.  You might disagree with looking back to the earliest edits but that is what [[WP:ENGVAR]] calls for.  Frankly, I would probably support Wikipedia having a specified spelling style but that is not what we currently have in the guidelines and individual articles are not the right place to argue for it.  As far as I can see the earliest editor to unambiguously adopt a spelling style was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transistor&diff=next&oldid=287163 here] (note ''colouration'').

:::Well, I did study the history, and it appeared to me to be solidly American for many years, with a few recent Britishisms.  The IP edit you reverted was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transistor&diff=409489677&oldid=408942544 this one]; so we should look for what led to it.

The only other Britishism I notice at that time is "standardised"; no "behaviour" but two "behavior"s.  The sentence "Prior to the development of transistors, vacuum (electron) tubes (or in the UK "thermionic valves" or just "valves") were the main active components in electronic equipment" suggests a US perspective in use.

== Possibly a stupid question ==

"when electrical contacts were applied to a germanium crystal, the output power was larger than the input." 

This seems very misleading -- I assume that two different power measurements are being performed, and the device didn't suddenly get very cold, or violate thermodynamics? That is to say, as it reads now, it seems like the device is creating energy out of nowhere. Could it be fixed by citing the work in question and explaining which power outputs were measured (I assume c-e power, not b-e?

== First silicon transistor ==

Someone editing under the name Tanenbaum says that Morris Tanenbaum made the first diffused silicon transistor in January 1954. The Siffert book cited in the article says that TI announced their silicon transistor in May 1954. The Tanenbaum physics paper was published in 1955. "Makers of the Microchip: A Documentary History of Fairchild Semiconductor" by Christophe Lacuyer, page 10, says March 1955, Tanenbaum, diffused "mesa" transistor - but the physics paper has "grown junction" in the title. "Electronics: The Life Story of a Technology" by David L. Morton says Tanenbaum, diffused transistor, early 1955.  My 1956 "Handbook of Semiconductor Electronics" by Hunter pays no attention to trivia like who invented the transistor, but does list the 1955 Tanenbaum grown junction paper in the bibliography. 
  
So, which silicon transistor (diffused or grown) was the first, which one did TI announce in May 1954, obviously they'd been working on it for some time before announcing it, and which one did Dr. Tanenbaum create, and when? --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 23:27, 1 October 2011 (UTC)

"the resistor ''must be'' chosen" implies an imperative on the designer who is quite free to choose an inadequate resistor.

The [http://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/belllabs_transistor.html Bell labs webpage] Has a copy of the [http://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/pdf/transistorname.pdf ballot] used to determine the name of the transistor with the description of term 'transistor' given as a portmanteau of the terms 'transconductance,' 'transfer,' and 'varistor.' 

The current article claims a portmanteau of the term 'transfer resistor.'

:The ballot actually says "transconductance ''or'' transfer".  I have to say that ''varistor'' makes more sense to me than ''resistor'', but I note that ''varistor'' is itself a portmanteau of ''variable''+''resistor'' and that ''transistor'' has entirely lost the ''var'' element so ''transfer''+''resistor'' in not entirely wrong.  The difficulty here is going to be sourcing.  There are literally thousands of RS out there verifying ''transfer resistor''.  I could find only [https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=transfer+varistor&btnG=#hl=en&tbm=bks&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22transfer+varistor%22&oq=%22transfer+varistor%22&gs_l=serp.3...705095.707274.8.707539.3.3.0.0.0.1.354.731.0j1j1j1.3.0...0.0...1c.1.7.psy-ab.C-VSJSxR_y4&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.44158598,d.d2k&fp=7613121a6da26006&biw=948&bih=902 three results on gbooks] for ''transfer varistor'', only two or which are in English.  It would be some task to show that these sources are more authoritative than the thousands of others.  I do not think that the appearance of ''transfer varistor'' on a ballot paper settles the matter.  This is a primary source and furthermore gives no indication of the result of the ballot or whether this interpretation was adopted.  A press release from Bell Labs at the time, or the appearance of the term in their jourhanl would be much more convincing.

== Voltage Controlled Bipolar Transistor ==

I have edited the text where the following statement is:
 
“By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled.[24]”

It is fundamentally not correct, and perpetuates misunderstandings as to how a bipolar transistor actually works.

Before my edits are considered to be reverted, please refer to the original Gummel–Poon_model paper cited at  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummel%E2%80%93Poon_model

A direct quote from this Gummel-Pool paper is (P.828):

“…The new charge control relation arises from the treatment of the transport equation for the carriers that pass between emitter and collector. Use is made of the fact that recombination has only a very small effect on the junction-voltage dependence of the current passing from emitter to collector (later called the dominant current component). Hence for this dependence, but of course not for the base current, recombination is neglected. A direct closed-form solution of the transport equation from inside the emitter to inside the collector is possible…”

It is noted, recombination *is* the base current. Since this base current is neglected (initially) in the Gummel–Poon method  of calculating the collector current from the base emitter voltage and collector voltage it is simply not reasonable to then claim that “the collector current is *controlled* by the base current”.

The “charge control” model, by design, as shown above, calculates the base charge resulting from the applied *voltages* at the base and collector. It is noted that the base charge is not the charge flowing out of the base, but the charge in the base region, which has no direct relation to the charge flowing out of the base.

So, fundamentally the bipolar transistor is a voltage controlled device. Any base current that flows is simply a nuisance, and not any way key to transistor operation. This is clearly the opinion of some of the most noted experts (Gummel-Pool) on transistor theory. 

If any editor has a more academic *reliable* source that contradicts the Gummel-Pool voltage controlled view above, and can present the basics of an actual theory as to why the bipolar transistor would be base current controlled, present it here, or please leave my latest edits alone.

'''' BJT is a current controlled voltage device but JFET is a voltage controlled current device. Explain it.''''
 
One could argue that both devices are non-linear "voltage-controlled resistors", but the usefulness of a model is based on the ease and accuracy of creating or comparing a model with reality.

After reading the comparison http://www.designers-guide.org/VBIC/documents/ted00.pdf of the old (Spice-Gummel-Poon) SGP model with new VBIC ( Vertical Bipolar Inter-Company) model developed by a group from the Semiconductor Industry, I am convinced it is the better way to forward in use of SPICE models. The precise modelling requires sequential non-linear regression and then a tolerance of parameters to std.tolerances, which is not discussed and is non-trivial. However the results are clearly, far more accurately as a result of the regression feedback. ( Praise not to Allah, but the Semi guys who developed the model.)

For example the representation of Beta or current gain, where the mountain shaped curves "almost" have a plateau in only 3 decades out 10 for Ic ( 6,7&8 ). The last two decades are a steep cliff where saturation begins and Beta drops to 10 (on most devices)

So I hope they do replace the GP model with the VBIC model in SPICE for the benefit of future application designers.

But really, both transistors are just non-linear voltage controlled resistors. There's no "active" power source inside. But the sensitivity of this behaviour makes them "active" either have good small signal gain or large signal switch properties or impedance buffers (CC mode) depend on the circuit. This "active" region, I suppose is due to the "negative" resistance behaviour, as it often observed with any plasma tube or Fear mongering god.

== Package power rating table ==

I have cleaned up [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transistor&diff=572619602&oldid=572475397 this edit] from [[user:Magnus0re]] who inserted a table of transistor package power capabilities.  However, I have concerns that a good deal of OR went into the construction of this table despite its heavy referencing.  The "range" column seems to have been arrived at by examining a number of transistor data sheets and taking the [[extrema]] and the "approx." column by taking the average.  This would make it a bad case of [[WP:SYNTH]].  I don't think packages have a minimum power rating so the range column is meaningless.  More useful would be a sourced list of ''package'' maximum power ratings which one is not going to find in any transistor data sheet. '''[[User:Spinningspark|<font style="background:#fafad2;color:#C08000">Spinning</font>]][[User talk:Spinningspark|<font style="color:#4840a0">Spark'''</font>]]''' 11:28, 13 September 2013 (UTC)

:- You are correct in assuming that the range column have been arrived at by taking the extrema. the approx column is just that, approximate, Yes it is a created number by comparing different datasheets. 

:My opinion is that the approx range may have a bad name, but I think it is true to the [[WP:SYNTH]](no OR), because many reliable sources(hundreds, if not thousands of datasheets) exists that say that their transistor packages are capable of wattages in that range. Also the table is in line with the Neutral point of view and Verifiability, because it represents the approx number that is a more proportionate number than the maximum, (the maximum serves to promote one device while the approx serves to inform about what might be expected of a range of devices) 

:The reason I included both is because this is much more useful for a person trying to select a package(rather than only maximum values, because then the engineer will be looking for the one device with max. documented power handling, which is not good.), because there is only a few rare and expensive devices that can take the maxima. (in this case only a few mosfets, not bjts.) 

:On second thought maybe the Approx column should be renamed into something like "assumed median value +/- 300% accuracy, consult individual datasheet". But the purpose of the column was to put a number to what can be expected of devices in that package. Is there a better name or better way to implement such a number? [[User:Magnus0re|Magnus0re]] ([[User talk:Magnus0re|talk]]) 12:40, 15 September 2013 (UTC)
::Since you specified a range for each package, I think the approximate column should be left out as it doesn't really mean anything.  A table of power range for a given package is useful information.  However, the range you give is just the range you have found by looking at many data sheets.  Personally, I would find that to be useful.  But, you may not have actually found the extremes which is why a reliable source is needed.  Also, I took the liberty of indenting your response.[[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 18:02, 15 September 2013 (UTC)
:::I doubt that there actually exists a power rating for packages and even if it does, it is likely to be way more than any particular device.  The limitation on power is dependent on many things beside the package: how the device is internally mounted and the heatsink used externally for instance.  The principle limitation may not be thermal dissipation, it may be current handling capability of the device, or even the gauge of the wires or straps connecting to the top pads of the chip.  I think a principle reason driving choice of package is how easily it can be mounted on a suitable size heatsink.
:::I think a better approach here would be to take a suitable group of common devices and list the actual package and rating for each device.  That way OR is avoided and there is no need for a whole herd of references on each line which then have to be synthesised.

:::: Many packages do, in fact, have a power rating.

Please remove the following paragraph (added as part of edit 16:32, 30 Oct, 2006)

 "Unlike bipolar transistors, FETs do not inherently amplify a photocurrent.  Nevertheless, there are ways to use them, especially JFETs, as light-sensitive devices, by exploiting the photocurrents in channel–gate or channel–body junctions."

Reason:
Bipolar transistors do not inherently amplify a photo current. The term "photocurrent" is not explained or defined (is this The flow of photons or electrons?). Since this paragraph Is describing a special type of FET, removing this paragraph removes a "distraction" from this more general discussion of transistors. Photosensitive FET should be covered in the FET topic.

The definition that portmanteau is a combination of two words is actually not accurate in linguists, I believe,where it is defined as two morphemes. In any case, I gave the explicit reference for my change, which is probably the most definitive and authoritative account and history of the Bell System ever written.

:Hi Kbrose, I was not disputing the authority of the source, my request was for an exact quote from the source.  On ''portmanteau'', the OED definition is "[a] word formed by blending sounds from two or more distinct words and combining their meanings".  I think your definition of "two morphemes" is wrong, but you still need two of something to make it, not one of something.  You may have been thinking of the liguistic concept of (again OED) "[a] morph which represents two or more morphemes simultaneously".  That is not really relevant here, but in any case ''transistor'' is clearly not a morph since it can be broken down into its constituent morphemes.

:I've never heard of an analog ROM either. [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 21:50, 10 December 2015 (UTC)

The technology was developed by Barrie Gilbert of Tektronix for the analog readout system of the 7000 series oscilloscopes. You can read about it [http://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/7000_series_readout_system here]. The analog mask ROMs use an array of multi-emitter transistors. Data is stored in these ROMs in the number of emitters connected to the output. Similar technology was duplicated in the USSR to the best of my knowledge. However, since it is pretty niche I'm totally fine with it not being in the article. -- [[User:Phiarc|Phiarc]] ([[User talk:Phiarc|talk]]) 22:48, 10 December 2015 (UTC)

== Need better picture of NPN/PNP symbols for infobox ==
Currently, there aren't very many clean images of electronic symbols [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:BJT_transistor_symbols available at wikimedia] for use in the infobox. (Compare to the nice svg images in [[Resistor]] and [[Capacitor]].) If anyone had any, or could produce any, that would be very much appreciated.

== A transistor is an amplifier or switch, not a perpetual motion engine ==

"John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&T's Bell Labs in the United States performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input.[11]"--That makes it sound like the crystal added power.  It could not have.  The article cited actually says, "When the point of the triangle was placed onto the germanium, the signal came in through one gold contact and increased as it raced out the other."  It doesn't mention that there must have been a second input providing the power for the output signal, but I assume there was.  A transistor--and, I presume, that crystal--uses a small signal to modulate a larger signal. However, I don't know how the sentence should be rephrased, since the cited article is unclear on where the input power came from.

:Yes, amplifiers work by taking power from a power supply.  Energy is conserved. [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 04:02, 18 February 2017 (UTC)

== Introduction misleading on Lilienfeld? ==

The introduction looks excellent in most respects, but I feel it is a little misleading on the subject of Lilienfeld's contribution. "''...conceived...by Julius Lilienfeld, and...practically implemented by...Bardeen...Brattain, and...Shockley''" makes it sound like Lilienfeld did all the creative work and BBS were just his laboratory assistants.  Were Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley even aware of Lilienfeld's work? The Nobel was given to BBS, but the intro makes it sound like Lilienfeld also shared in it.  L didn't even build a prototype.  I think the intro should credit BBS as the inventors, but say Lilienfeld had the idea for the field-effect tran sister before them. --<font color="blue">[[User:Chetvorno|Chetvorno]]</font><sup>''<small>[[User talk:Chetvorno|<font color="Purple">TALK</font>]]</small>''</sup> 20:39, 6 March 2016 (UTC) <font color="blue">[[User:Chetvorno|Chetvorno]]</font><sup>''<small>[[User talk:Chetvorno|<font color="Purple">TALK</font>]]</small>''</sup> 20:39, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

:Yes, it's completely misleading and should be taken out.  Lilienfeld's idea was a field-effect device, completely unrelated to the point-contact junction device that was actually the first transistor.  Lilienfeld deserves a mention in this article, but he really was not part of the thread that led to the first transistor being made.

:Yes, misleadingly stated.  Lilienfeld's invention did come up as a big block to broad patent coverage on the transistor; Shockley tried to make a FET, but couldn't make it work at that time, due to surface charge problems; then the other guys came along and made the bipolar work.  The relationship here is important, but hard to state correctly in so few words.  [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 04:10, 7 March 2016 (UTC)

:When I was reading the article, I noticed the ambiguity over Lilienfeld and the Nobel Prize. I've gone and {{diff|Transistor|711938791|711938386|changed}} the wording to remove the ambiguity by making the winners' names explicit. There might be a better way to phrase it than I've done but it's an improvement. Also, don't forget our unofficial motto: "[[WP:Be Bold|Be bold]]".

::As the [[History of the transistor]] shows there was also Oskar Heil's 1934 patent on a [[field-effect transistor]] but how that figured (if at all) into the 1947 discovery is not touched on.--[[Special:Contributions/2606:A000:7D44:100:D884:3657:746F:E0DB|2606:A000:7D44:100:D884:3657:746F:E0DB]] ([[User talk:2606:A000:7D44:100:D884:3657:746F:E0DB|talk]]) 16:41, 4 April 2017 (UTC)

== Recent addition regarding static induction transistor (SIT) ==

The statement that the SIT invented in 1950 was the first high frequency transistor or even that it was a high frequency transistor is in not supported by any of the references.  What is supported is that as of the date of one reference’s publication (1996), Silicon Carbide SIT’s were faster than silicon devices.  That the SIT was the fastest transistor through he 1980’s is not supported by any of the references.   The references do confirm that the SIT was invented in 1950 by Watanabe and Nishizawa.   [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 22:19, 14 May 2017 (UTC)
:I've reverted it for now.  The McCluskey source says that experimental SITs were fabricated in 1975.  High frequency transistors were certainly available in the 1960s, so claiming SITs as the first is dubious at best.  Maybe it was the first HF design to be studied or published, but that would need a source saying so explicitly.

== Spule ==

I just wanted you to know that german Wikipedia has an article for "inductor" and it's not "Induktanz" but "[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spule_(Elektrotechnik) Spule]".
:[[wikt:Spule|Spule]] means "coil", not inductance. The German article does explain that coils are passive components that possess a definite inductance: ''Andererseits sind separate Spulen induktive passive Bauelemente, deren wesentliche Eigenschaft eine definierte Induktivität ist.''

== Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld ==

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld

"Because of his failure to publish articles in learned journals and because high-purity semiconductor materials were not available yet...."

So he didn't publish anything, and his invention was impossible, why is this person here? He should not even be in this wiki. Why don't you put Leonardo Da Vinci in here?  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/73.137.94.180|73.137.94.180]] ([[User talk:73.137.94.180#top|talk]]) 04:38, 8 December 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Number (grammar)==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transistor&diff=prev&oldid=842067864 This edit] changed "transistors" to "transistor". It appears to me the sentence requires the plural.

The edit summary stated "does anyone call bare dice 'discrete transistors' ? Undid revision 842048014 by Tom94022 (talk))
".

I don't understand how the edit summary justifies the edit. I DO call bare dice, each containing one transistor, discrete transistors. I saw some [[IBM Solid Logic Technology]] being tested just after the discrete transistors had been assembled onto the module. (They were thoroughly obsolete when I saw them, but they had been used in some obscure peripheral or power supply, and the department that designed it never got the memo about SLT being depricated.) [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 01:57, 20 May 2018 (UTC)

:I agree.  It should be plural.  [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 02:17, 20 May 2018 (UTC)

Discretes such as 2N2222A are sold as bare dice (a plural I prefer to ''die''), e.g. [https://siliconsupplies.com/product-detail/Transistors/Bipolar-Junction-BJT/NPN-Bipolar-Transistor/2N2222A here]. And yes bare dice are referred to as ''discrete transistors'' e.g. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9VHMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA865&dq=bare+die+discrete+transistor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKqYT7jpjbAhURB3wKHT30DucQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=bare%20die%20discrete%20transistor&f=false here]. [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 01:01, 22 May 2018 (UTC)
:That should settle that issue.  At least one manufacturer provides discrete transistors as bare die. [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 01:41, 22 May 2018 (UTC)

:I'm still of the opinion that ''die'' is used as both singular and plural by at least some large semiconductor companies (Texas Instruments, On Semi and Analog Devices).  Infineon uses ''dies''.  The distributor SemiDice use ''die''. Micron avoids the issue by using die only as an adjective such as ''bare die products''.
