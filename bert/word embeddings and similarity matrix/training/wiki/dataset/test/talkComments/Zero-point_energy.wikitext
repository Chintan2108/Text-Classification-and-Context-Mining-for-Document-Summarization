== Bell Labs show Casimir force on nano machine ==

http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/021401/Quantum_effect_moves_machine_021401.html

A very interesting article about the work [[Bell Labs]] has been doing to look into the potential problems of "[[Nano bots]]" due to zero-point energy.

== dark matter and black holes ==
Matter lifts (gradually creating hills, that's why planets create negligible dark matter) the zero-point energy, and that generates more mass than the baryonic. We call that phenomenon dark matter.

:: that path of thought will help you also resolve the vacuum energy catastrophe

clue: because (not directly because, but by following a similar reasoning) we do have dark matter, that's why we don't have a high vacuum energy
:: quantum fluctuations of the void are random events, and the energy of the void has to accumulate around virtual particles '''in order to exist''', virtual particles aren't strictly quantized but close to a quantization range, and you don't have to quantize all possible arrangements at once, instead you have to study an average path of virtual particles and what that causes to the zero-point energy of that region, something like mini dark matter

== Hard to Follow ==

This article is really hard to follow and the format feels a bit scattered-brained. I'm not qualified to edit this article, or otherwise I would. If someone could please make it more readable, that would be much appreciated, especially since I came to this article for research on a game module I am writing.

The '''Zero Point Energy''' is the energy of the Zero Point Field (ZPF).
This is a hypotheical field of electro magnetic radiation, with random direction, phase, and polarization, but with a frequencey cubed frequency spectral energy density.
The ZPF has also been called [[Vacuum Polarization]], [[Vacuum Energy]].

When [[Niels Bohr]] showed that one could substitute (n + 1/2) for each of the quantum numbers and keep the same transition levels in the hydrogen atom.
This allows the sidestepping of the problem of energy disappearing when using zero as the quantum number.

[[Max Planck]] then substituted n+1/2 to get his second theorem:

<math>\rho^\prime(\nu,T) = \rho(\nu,T) + 4\pi h \nu^3/c^3</math>
[J/m<sup>3</sup>]

Three items of interest:
# It is independent of temperature.
# As &nu; increases without bound the energy density rapidly approachs infinity.  Thus there is a huge EMR field.
#It is equal to 1/2 the numerator of %rho(%nu;,T).

[[Albert Einstein]] and [[Ludwig Hopf]] then showed that the force exterted on
an electron is 

<math>
F = (4\pi^2e^2v/5\epsilon_0mc^2)[(\nu/3)\frac{d\rho}{d\nu}-\rho(\nu)]

</math>
[Newtons]

equating the terms within the square brackets to zero, we get the differential equation
<math>
\rho(\nu)=(\nu/3)d\rho/d\nu
</math>. 
which is true for <math>\rho(\nu) = k\nu^3</math>, where k is any constant.
This shows that a random EMR field with energy density proportional to frequency cubed will, on the average, exert no force on any charged particle.

Planck's second theorem has this frequency cubed form.
So the field predicted by Plank's second theorem would not be detectable in the average.  There are small effects similar to [[brownian mothion]].
 
But the infinite frequency and energy would preclude this from reality, if there were not a cut-off frequency.  A frequency such as the one that corresponds to a wavelength of the size of the Planck length, would work.  Thus a cut-off frequency can be applied.

== Article should perhaps mention nut-cases ==

A lot of people will come to this article because they have seen mentions of zero-point energy elsewhere on the web.  They'll be interested in finding out if there is anything to the grandiose claims of perpetual-motion machines, an imminent revolution in our energy economy, the relationship of zero-point energy to the Rapture, the Cthulhu Mythos, Britney Spears, the Zionist Occupied Government, and so on and on ad nauseam.

I think we should say somewhere: these claims are bogus.  At best the promulgators are misguided; at worst, they are out to steal your money in fraudulent investment schemes.  The reader deserves more than our coy silence on the subject.

As you can tell, I'm a bit exercised about this, which is why I'm not writing the text I wish for.  I couldn't achieve NPOV.  But somebody should try.  Thanks in advance.

[[User:ACW|ACW]] 05:42, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Define nut-case. Some of the so-called perpetual motion machines are in fact free electricity machines which is a completely different thing. And since at least some of them seem to be working at least in some manner it seems that some of the stuff is real - and that with good funding might find theories to support them too. I admit that I need more information on both these generators and physics to make any kind of final conclusions, but at least I'm giving them the benefit of doubt. --[[User:Khokkanen|Khokkanen]] 7 July 2005 15:06 (UTC)

::I don't know what these free electricity machines of which you speak are; can you provide a reference?  My guess is that if they appeal to the concept of zero-point energy, and claim to be cheap sources of energy, they are an example of the bogus claims I mentioned.  I'm willing to take a look, though.  And as you can see, I'm still not neutral enough to write any of this up :)  [[User:ACW|ACW]] 7 July 2005 22:09 (UTC)

:::ACW - to explain in a very simple nutshell how you can have "free" energy without violating any laws of physics:  suppose that there are a lot of high-energy but *very* weakly interacting particles passing through everything  (let's say neutrinos).  the temperature of ambient neutrinos is (let's say) a few million degrees.  further suppose that you find some substance that (unlike almost all other matter) is *strongly* interacting with these high-energy neutrinos.  all of a sudden that heats up, and you can extract useful power from the energy gradient between it and everything else.  this violates neither conservation of energy nor any of the laws of thermodynamics.  the idea behind extracting energy from the ZPE field is similar except the high-energy pool is provided by electomagnetic fields which are very high-frequency (think on the order of 1/planck time) and which furthermore have random phase/orientation.  they are not weakly interacting, on the contrary everything is in thermal equilibrium with them (constantly absorbing and retransmitting), but if you could (let's say) shield them to any degree you would have a useable gradient that you can extract power from.  such shielding is one of the proposed explanations for the [[Casimir effect]] which has (a) been experimentally demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt and which (b) appears to produce energy out of nowhere. [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 8 July 2005 01:01 (UTC)

:::ACW - In fact I don't know any free electrivity machines that claim the use of ZPE - or even Vacuum Electricity, although the 'machine' for the latter appears to have been invented. Check [http://www.cheniere.org Cheniere] for further details on vacuum energy. I am quite willing to agree that some things Bearden writes about are little nuts (take his position on scalar EM weapons for example), but some other things on that site at least appear legit - if you're open-minded enough. However, here are some of the free electricity machines I mentioned (they claim that the source of the extra energy are permanent magnets): http://www.freelectricity.com and http://www.lutec.com.au


I can't belive this is even being discussed. I think this portends the fall of western civilization perfectly( discussing whether or not these people are nutcases). By the defninition given here, all energy is free. The very thing that requires the existence of "zero point energy" also requires that it is impossible to extract for longer than the planck time. That or something aboiut physics is seriously misunderstood(which very wwell may be).  Either way there won't be free enrgy.

:"The very thing that requires the existence of "zero point energy" also requires that it is impossible to extract for longer than the planck time" - why is that?  Perhaps you can illustrate using a work cycle based on the dynamic Casimir effect?  (i.e. bring plates together flat, slide them sideways, repeat)  "fall of western civilization" - right, that's a good attitude.  Dunno about you, but I think Puthoff, Milonni, Haisch, Rueda, Forward, etc are as good at physics as anyone, and if they think energy from vacuum is theoretically possible (perhaps not with our current technology) that's good enough for me.  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 11:39, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

::You have to demonstrate that you get ''more'' energy from the plates coming together than you need to 1) overcome their friction when you slide them apart again, and 2) move the plates back into alignment.  My guess is no.  [[User:Endomion|Endomion]] 06:47, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

== Gobbledegook to Lay Person ==

Shouldn't the topic include some sort of simplified description or analogy for the person without a degree in quantum mechanics and mathematics?

:Definitely agree. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:42, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
What the heck, (simplification is risky, but here goes)

Quantum mechanics provides some mathematical models that characterize the behavior of small particles (atoms, molecules sub-atomic particles). The main behavior in question is the motion of particles that are moving in close proximity and are attracted to each other. What we observe is that the particles cannot move freely in any old orbit, they are restricted to particular orbits that are characterised by particular energies and momenta, with elaborate sets of rules. If particles find themselves in non-allowed states of motion, they radiate energy and drop into an allowed state. This is all observed, and all the mathematical complexity amounts to a road map that tells us a lot about the allowed states and how they interact.

What the equations show is that the state of "no energy" (I suppose, just two particles stuck together) doesn't occur. Hydrogen, (an electron and a proton) has a lowest or "ground" state - that's why it persists otherwise it would collapse and the electron would crash in to the proton and stay there (it couldn't collapse into neutron without added energy). 

So in a sense, ordinary matter has a lowest possible or "zero point" energy. A common feature of all these low energy states is that they comply with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle wherein parameters (energy mutliplied by duration and/or dimension multiplied by momentum) remain above a certain minimum (h/2) where h is Planck's constant. 

The concept of Zero Point Fields (ZPF) is a kind of thought experiment in which it is supposed that electromagnetic radiation in space is also constrained by the same quantum rules that apply to the motion of particles of matter.  ZPF proponents often propose that the Heisenberg principle is universal and applies to light and other electromagnetic radiation.

To start with, we observe that electromagnetic radiation induces harmonic motion when it interacts, and on top of that, quantum theory gives us formal equations as to how to model this. 

Quantum theory shows that a physical harmonic oscillator is characterized by a motion that has a constant frequency (f), no matter what the energy. The interval between levels is hf (h is Planck's constant) and a lowest possible energy (ZPH) is hf/2.

On top of that, photons of light are governed by a similar relationship wherein each carries an energy (E) given by E=hf. The match-up with spacing of the oscillator's levels of E=hf leads to the idea that the two are related phenomena.  

To get to the ZPF, one then assumes that the fields that make up radiation in free space are exactly like a physical harmonic oscillator where the energy exchanged is E=hf but there is an underlying "inaccessable" Zero Point Field energy of hf/2. As far as I know, nobody has figured a clear-cut experiment that allows us to demonstrate the existence (or abscence) of this energy, because it is by definition, inaccessable.  As an aside, if ZPF works, then why aren't there photons of 2hf, 3hf etc...

In summary, the quantum mechanics cannot be appled directly to get the ZPF because the equations specifically describe states of motion of matter (not fields) and how matter exchanges energy with electromagnetic radiation. To get ZPF, on has to make assumptions such as: 
1) That Heisenberg uncertainty applies to radiation in space and/or 
2) That radiation in space is constrained to operate in a manner similar to a physical harmonic oscillator.

Does this help? Or is it still too obscure?

:It's a good try, but I think you're working from a misunderstanding of what ZPF is and why it pretty much has to exist according to current theory.  It comes straight from the equations of quantum electrodynamics/quantum field theory, not from a vague reasoning by analogy of the electromagnetic field with a harmonic oscillator.  I don't think "inaccessible" is correct either. [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 07:59, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

== Clarification Request ==

A naive question I have after reading this is that the conclusion made doesn't make sense because the presmises are completely contrived.
The presmise is:
a particle is confined to a box.  

Conclusion:
It cannot have 0 velocity because then its position would be infinitely indetermite, meaning that it could be outside of the box, thereby violating the premises.  So, the particle must have at least some non-zero velocity, therefore it must have some amount of kinetic energy.

My problem with this argument is that the premises doesn't make sense.  The conclusion is only possible given that one can make a box that can confine a particle.  This is a theoretical conception and one that I do not believe can be valid in the real world.  In reality, nothing can confine something like an electron.  The probability function for a particle is not dependent upon that particle's surroundings, so the presmises that a box can be made that can confine a particle is not true, thereby allowing the conclusion to say anything one wants.  -- [[63.252.65.120]]

The perfect particle-in-a-box is a bit of an idealized concept, but something very close is quite easy to do, e.g. two mirrors facing each other would box in photons (of the right wavelength) or two conductive plates with strong negative charges would box in electrons.  Obviously such boxes do not have perfect walls, and so you get [[quantum tunneling]], but that does not matter since even with tunneling you still get a minimum energy greater than zero.  The uncertainty principle is just an intuitive explanation of where that energy comes from.  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 22:28, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

You said "but that does not matter since even with tunneling you still get a minimum energy greater than zero."  Do you know of any references explaining why quantum tunneling would be a source of energy in this case?  I don't know much about it, but I'd always assumed it was just a property of particles, that they can do that.  Why is it that a particle which undergrous tunneling must have some amount of energy?  -- [[63.252.65.120]]

Hmm, actually it is the other way around, a box with imperfect walls has a lower energy zero state than one with perfect walls, in a sense the tunelling is an energy leak (sort of).  A good intuitive way to think about it is that ''any'' gradient of potential energy (which doesn't have to be a box, the field of a point charge would do just as well, that's basically an atom for you) sets up a "tension" which prevents the lowest kinetic energy from being zero, and the steeper the gradient the higher the minimum kinetic energy state.  Ideal box walls are as steep as it gets, anything in the real world is less so but the effect is qualitatively similar.  The equations for a box with walls of finite potential and finite thickness are solved in most standard textbooks (e.g. [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/052152086X/ Levi], [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195141954/ Fayer], or for a more theoretical treatment [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201539292/ Sakurai] or [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131118927/ Griffiths]).

== Pseudo Science  ==

Can any one offer any evidence from a Peer reviewed scientific paper or article that refers to Zero Point Energy (ZPE) as an "unsolved problem in physics"? Any papers that speak regularly of New Energy, Free Energy, Cold Fusion, Space Energy, Aether, Ether, Antigravity, or Levitation do not count. Best that I can see, ZPE is considered by every major Scientifically reputable organisation and Skeptical organisation as a pseudo science and not an "unsolved problem in physics", if im wrong please enlighten me. - [[User:UnlimitedAccess|UnlimitedAccess]] 21:04, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

I should also mention that your exclusion criteria do not make sense.  You require not ''merely'' a paper in a reputable peer-reviewed journal, but also that the author already agree with your preconceptions about what is scientific.  Why do you even bother asking for references then?  Incidentally your criteria would exclude almost any physics journal since they have all published any number of serious papers on these topics.  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 04:19, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
: Why? Do you even need to ask? Because all those topics I listed havent yet survived the scientific method of review and are all psuedoscience to the mainstream scientific community. Several Magazines that exclusively talk about "Free Energy", "Perpetual Motion" and "Cold Fusion" often talk of Zero Point Energy, I didnt want to be provided with any links from those sources because they were clearly not for the mainstream scientific community.

: Basicaly if you believe in ZPE, [[Alien Abductions]], [[Biofeedback]], [[Biorhythyms]], [[Alchemy]] or anything else unaccepted then start to convince the scientific community first, then come back to wikipedia. No doubt their is some really qualified educated people out their trying to prove ZPE is "real", but until then it remains a pseudoscience unaccepted by the mainstream scientific community and this page MUST reflect that and join the <nowiki>[[Category:Pseudoscience]]</nowiki>. Their is a great deal of research  into Zero Point Energy as a theoretical energy source and their is quite a lot of "pretty" mathematics their, however no experiment that can be repeated has been accepted by the scientific community that it is a real energy source, and every example to date that claims they not only have proved it exists but have built a machine to utilise it have ALL so far turned out to be charlatans/frauds. - [[User:UnlimitedAccess|UnlimitedAccess]] 08:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Oh, now it has to be a working energy source, does it?  Look, you asked for references, I gave you some (I have lots more) from physics journals which are about as mainstream as they get.  Now go read them and maybe you'll learn something and stop trolling.  You may think ZPE is as crazy as Alien Abductions, but you sure haven't made an argument for that (listing them next to each other is not an argument). Dismissing the research as ''"their is quite a lot of "pretty" mathematics their"'' isn't exactly a good argument either.  None of the serious physicists working on this have made the claim that a working energy source can be built with present technology (and present understanding).  You brought up such a claim, that's a strawman argument.    [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 19:02, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
::: Im not going to argue with you about whether ZPE is real or not, its irrelevant what you or I think. I was trying to raise the point that mainstream science and every Skeptics association around the world refer to it as pseudoscience and as such this article MUST reflect that. When I said "their is quite a lot of "pretty" mathematics their" I ment it as a complement for the field I wasnt dimissing anything (at Uni we often use "pretty" as a way to offer maths a complement), sorry I wasnt being clear. "None of the serious physicists working on this have made the claim that a working energy source can be built" I never said they did, but the article must reflect exactly what you just said, but I dont see it anywhere. Look I appologise for my abrasiveness but I just want this article to contain the facts, and I could of been a jerk and changed it, and then we would go into a revert war etc, but I figured it is better to chat it out before hand (since it will involve a rewrite). - [[User:UnlimitedAccess|UnlimitedAccess]] 04:25, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:::: "I appologise for my abrasiveness" - I thank you for being very reasonable about this. I apologize for my  abrasiveness as well.  "mainstream science and every Skeptics association around the world refer to it as pseudoscience" - I couldn't care less about what skeptics associations think.  In my limited personal experience, they tend to be people with really unbearable personalities and way too much free time.  Can you cite any actual references that show mainstream science refers to ZPE as pseudoscientific?  "the article must reflect exactly what you just said" - ok.  I think Milonni mentioned in an interview (from NASA's Advanced Propulsion Workshop?? I think) that we're a long ways from having working hardware.  If you can find that, cite it.  At the same time, several ''very'' reputable physicists have said that you can definitely extract ZPE in theory, we should mention that was well.  I think what's really bothering you is the fact that there are people who describe or promote free energy devices that work based on ZPE according to them.  I don't believe any of those do work, and the experimental protocols they follow are pretty execrable, but it ''is'' possible in theory, so I would be reluctant to dismiss all of them without looking at each one.  The Brown effect and some electrochemical experiments in particular have interesting parallels with ways in which you could test for the presence of ZPE.  If you want to add a disclaimer to the effect that present-day supposedly-ZPE devices are probably bogus, go ahead (although it would be ideal to quote one of the scientists who actually work on ZPE for that).  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 12:28, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

ZPE is a pseudoscience and has a history of being used by scam artists etc, but the more controversial issue for me is that it could be descibed as an "Unsolved problem in physics". Could you offer any clear evidence to support that? Hell you could be right, I just need some convincing. String Theory is clearly an "Unsolved problem in physics", but thats because it is a Protoscience, can ZPE really be reffered to as an "Unsolved problems in physics" as a psuedoscience? Perhaps look at it this way do mainstream science acknowledge their is an unsolved problem or is it only the supporters of ZPE that "see" it? Im not quite sure how to look at that one, what do you think? - [[User:UnlimitedAccess|UnlimitedAccess]] 04:25, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:"ZPE is a pseudoscience" - no.  First, there is no evidence that ZPE research does not follow the scientific method, or that ZPE violates any physical laws.  Second, there is a very large ZPE literature in mainstream publications.  "has a history of being used by scam artists" - possibly, but that has nothing to do with whether it is a pseudoscience.  You may not like the idea of "free energy", but a number of very distinguished scientists (such as Milloni and Forward) have specifically said it is possible (with math, even ;).  I would be very skeptical of any claims of actual working devices, but the theoretical possibility exists.  "Could you offer any clear evidence to support that?" - yes.  There are several unsolved problems.  The major one is how to conduct an experiment which unambiguosly tests for the presence of ZPE. That is much harder than it may appear: while such experiments are quite easy to come up with as thought experiments the magnitude of the effects is too low to be easily observable (e.g. gravitation should not be strictly additive, but the effect is <10^-15, while a direct measurement of gravitation is only accurate to 10^-4).  (I've seen this discussed in papers, I'd have to dig them up for you if you really want them).  Another unsolved problem is how, given the extremely high energy density of ZPE, can the cosmological constant be what it is?  This is actually pretty well explained by [[stochastic electrodynamics]].  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 06:55, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
::Cool, I am happy with it being listed as an unsolved problem in physics now. However as I said before it doesnt matter whether you or I consider it a pseudoscience, it IS a pseudoscience because mainstream science and every skeptics associations considers it so, for whatever reason. [[Acupuncture]] is considered a pseudoscience despite their being a lot of scientific papers about it (written by very qualified and intelligent people) and even some evidence that it can help certain individuals in some circumstances. This is an Encyclopedia, it doesnt matter what you or I think, our oppinions and any evidence we raise is also irrelevant, it is considered pseudoscience because mainstream science considers it so, with of course a rebuttle that certain high profile, highly talented proffesionals believe otherwise.

::The most important things about ZPE that come to my mind though, are; 1) What the Theory is. 2) The stance from mainstream science 3) The hundreds of machines that have been patented or at least the history of funding fathered from unsuspecting people and businesses that have lost millions (but with more NPOV wording ;) ) 4) A concession that a dedicated group of specialists scientists support the theory and are hard at work making it an accepted science, or at least have some "pretty" mathematics to show for their findings much like string theory etc. 5) Pop Culture References

:::1. ok
:::2. "mainstream science" in this context is those mainstream scientists who are actually working on it or closely related fields.  by all means cite them.  (also you will note in the pseduoscience article that pseudoscience is defined by the method, not the participants)
:::3. ok, but be careful about what claims you make.  for example, you can't say that all of these machines ''don't'' work.  you can say none have been proven to work.  also "based on the current level of theoretical understanding, technological applications appear premature" or some such - this can probably be supported by a cite.
:::4. "dedicated group" implies small - not necessarily true, well over a hundred afaik.  "hard at work making it an accepted science" - anything published in Phys Rev or Phys Letters is by definition an accepted science ''hypothesis''.  promoting it to an established theory requires a lot more experiments, however there is nothing that disqualifies the topic from being a legitimate field of scientific research.

::: Mm, your references are primarily from SCICOP and Randi.  Sorry, but these guys are ''not'' part of the mainstream scientific community, and their expertise in this area is exactly zero.  You have one ref by Randall Woods ([http://www.physics.bcit.ca/rjw/pers/personal.htm], masters degree in physics only, no published work, and no work with any bearing on quantum mechanics or relativity), and one by Jacob Barandes (a physics grad student).  Not impressive.  Can you quote just a single physicist who is as well known as Rob Forward?
::: Regarding Infinite Energy Magazine/NEF: I looked at the page you pointed to [http://www.infinite-energy.com/whoarewe/whoarewe.html].  All three topics they mention have a reasonable scientific basis.  Speculative, maybe, and not very well/at all tested experimentally, but nonetheless reasonable hypotheses, definitely deserving further research.  That is not within the definition of pseudoscience.
::: "Cold Fusion *perhaps* is the one exception and could be called a protoscience." - Indeed.  The treatment of CF has been a total disgrace.  All of the early experiments were flawed, both the positive and the negative ones, but the flaws with the positive ones were extensively criticized while the flaws with the negative ones were ignored (or in some cases data was doctored to fit).  Experimental technique has gotten much better since, and now there are impeccable replications, but it doesn't matter since "everyone knows" it's bogus.

::: P.S. As a general note on the subject of skeptics:  the rush by people to debunk stuff which is not well understood to begin with strikes me as reasoning in advance of the evidence.  Also, I think the opportunity cost of funding stupid research (or even outright frauds) is low compared to the cost of ''not'' funding important research which seems oddball.  Skeptics assume they can tell which is which, but history has consistently shown that is not generally possible.  Fundamental research often proceeds more in breadth, not depth, and an inherent part of that is wasting money on things which will never work - just because they might.  However, perhaps the most important reason why I don't like skeptics is because they don't actually know a damn thing (I challenge you to get a reasonable explanation of the Casimir effect from anyone over at Randi).  Real scientists may be either very pig-headed, or very open-minded (although the really good ones tend to the latter), but at least they ''can'' evaluate a new hypothesis on its merits, not on the basis of (someone else's) prejudices. [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 00:37, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:I'm afraid your mistaken Skeptics associations ARE the mainstream scientific community. Your mixing up Cynics with Skeptics (cynicism is academic laziness, the complete opposite of Skepticism, See:[[Pathological skepticism]]). All im trying to prove is their is a general perception in the scientific community that ZPE and other Free Energy is psuedoscience. The whole thing is one big joke to mainstream science, my physics lecturers crack jokes about it, skeptics associations repeatively show the flaws in each of the many proposed machines, it difficult to get a mainstream physicist to even speak of ZPE because to the mainstream scientific community it is beneath their attention because "everyone knows" it's bogus, just as Bigfoot is to mainstream Zoologists and Intelligent Design is to biologists. Mainstream Academics who bother to speak on the topics at all do so via Skeptic organisations. If your still not convinced of what the mainstream perception of ZPE is, then do a google search, because any list you ask from me are going to come from the first 50 links in google anyway :).

: "All three topics they mention have a reasonable scientific basis.", in your oppinion or the Free Energy websites oppinion? In either case it doesnt matter, the label is put upon fields that the mainstream scientific community deems pseudoscience. You may believe that ZPE and Cold Fusion have been treated poorly (you may be right, but as I said it doesnt matter what we think), you cant really deny that like cold fusion "everyone knows" it's bogus, especially the mainstream scientific community.

: "Real scientists may be either very pig-headed, or very open-minded (although the really good ones tend to the latter), but at least they ''can'' evaluate a new hypothesis on its merits, not on the basis of (someone else's) prejudices." No they are the extremes, *real* scientists start off at a central point of view then base their oppinions on the evidence, text book definition of the modern Skeptic movement, anyone who does anything else are NOT skeptics, but arseholes :), but this is really not the place for this debate. - [[User:UnlimitedAccess|UnlimitedAccess]] 06:35, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

::UA: "one big joke to mainstream science, my physics lecturers crack jokes about it" - may I assume they haven't read the literature?  What exactly does that make them?  "difficult to get a mainstream physicist to even speak of ZPE" - hint, they don't get more mainstream than Robert Forward (look up his bio and publications list sometime).  He's probably one of a couple of guys with a good claim to having started this, along with Feynman and Sakharov.   "ZPE and other Free Energy" - ZPE is a well known consequence/feature of quantum mechanics, which includes only as a very minor side effect the theoretical possibility for a "free energy" device of sorts.  ZPE=/=free energy.  "mainstream perception of ZPE" - maybe, but that is just "perception" (i.e. prejudice), not a reasoned position.   Insofar as there is a ''position'', it is expressed in the fact that such papers (e.g. Rueda's) do get published without any obstacles.   I would argue that you're wrong about the perception as well, see e.g. [http://wired.com/wired/archive/6.07/es_warp.html] [http://www.quantumfields.com/bortman.htm] [http://www.calphysics.org/haisch/science.html] [http://www.calphysics.org/haisch/sciam.html] [http://www.calphysics.org/articles/newscientist.html].

::"in your oppinion or the Free Energy websites oppinion?" - neither.  there are numerous research papers on each one of these in reputable peer-reviewed journals.  "In either case it doesnt matter, the label is put upon fields that the mainstream scientific community deems pseudoscience." - no, that is not how the label is used.  As per discussion on the pseudoscience page, it is not ''defined by'' what anyone thinks, but rather by what ''is''.  Science is not a show of hands, it is an attempt to find out the truth.  While perhaps the only authority on science that wikipedia should recognize is scientists (for a number of reasons which I'm sure you can think of ;) they can and do disagree with each other.  In the case of a controversial topic for which there is a substantial faction of scientists in disagreement with the majority opinion, you can't use the label, since there is obviously a legitimate dispute going on within science (rather than nonsense outside of science).

I remember coming upon a patent at one point and looking it up at the US patent office website. It was a magnetic generator with no moving parts tha was said to extract from the ZPE field. Sorry that I do not have the number right now but I will get back to you if I come accross it again.


:Do you mean "[[Motionless Electrical Generator]] (MEG) is a unusal transformer, which is most notable for claims of over-unity operation (as stated by the inventors, after a predetermined switching event the "generator" operates without an application of external power). .... The United States patent office granted U.S. Patent 6362718 to the four inventors: Stephen L. Patrick, Thomas E. Bearden, James C. Hayes, and Kenneth D. Moore." ?

== for dummies? ==

I have to say I'm with Linas on this one.  A "for dummies" section is not very encyclopedic.  Having separate headings for each why/what/etc. is not encyclopedic, and a lot of the actual writing is questionable (in particular the Casimir effect is most cerainly not due to "spontaneously forming partical/energy fields resonating between the plates.")  All of the stuff in there can be probably rewritten as a one-to-two paragraph part of the introduction.  I will try to get to it soon.  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 20:13, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

: Well, now someone has replaced the intro with some jargon again. This is why I clearly labelled it. Please find a solution if you didn't like mine, since the article is going to continually be reverted so that it starts off like a technical handbook, when a large number of non-technical users have expressed a need for something understandable.

:Perhaps put a link at the very top, to a separate article which is written for non-technical readers. Make a note next to the link, in the source, that the link is not to be moved from the top.

:Readers who encounter something they don't understand at the start of an article stop reading straight away -- they don't find a simple explanation unless it is at the start. Even if you put one single, short, accurate, succinct paragraph of technical gobbledegook at the start, then a simple lay-explanation '''the lay-readers won't read it''' because they don't know if they understand it correctly, since they '''didn't understand the first paragraph'''.

==Ground state energy==
Linas, according to your new definition, the zero-point energy is the energy of the ground state (or the lowest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian). You know, however, that one can add a constant to the Hamiltonian (w/out gravity) and it still provides the same description of the behavior of the system. However, all the eigenvalues will be shifted by this constant. Therefore, your zero-point energy is defined up to an arbitrary constant. I'd rather say that what is meant by the term "zero-point energy" is the <b>difference</b>  between the minimal quantum-mechanical energy and the minimal classical energy, as the old definition said. (On the other hand, the vacuum energy, which is relevant for cosmology, does include the constant term. The zero-point energy is then only one of the contributions to the vacuum energy, the purely quantum-mechanical contribution.) [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 11:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:I believe you have that reversed: in classical physics, you may add a const to the classical hamiltonian without changing the resulting equations of motion.  In quantum mechanics, you may do so also, by lumping the const in with the potential (so that K.E.=mv^2/2 is preserved). Note that for QM, this is less-than satisfying, since the constant gets pushed into the operator, which is not so beautiful; adding a const to all the matrix elts of an operator is not really right, although it can be sort-of excused. In QFT, the hand-waving is worse, because now you have to preserve E^2=p^2+m^2 so there's no where to lump the constant.  In QFT, in a hand-waving way, the mass is the zero-point const; you can't adjust that. You can hand-wave it away because it doesn't affect e.g. one-loop and multi-loop mass corrections to propagators, but its "still there" in a deep sense. This is exactly why the string and M-theory guys take this all so very seriously: they really do equate the zero-point energy with the cosmo const, and desperately want to explain how it can be so small.  [[User:Linas|linas]] 15:28, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:This is particularly evident in solid-state physics, where the mean-square displacement of an atom in a crystalline lattice doesn't shrink to zero as temperature (number of phonons) goes to zero. I believe they've even made electron microscope pictures/measurements of this. [[User:Linas|linas]] 15:34, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

:I thought about this on the drive in to work. For the classical pair of orbiting electrical charges, the classical minimum energy is minus-infinity. So saying that the zero-point energy of the hydrogen atom is plus-infinity minus 13.7 is kind-of-weird if not outright wrong.

:Compare this to the zero-point energy of hydrogen derived from the uncertainty principle: the Bohr radius of hydrogen is R=0.53 angstroms. Thus, momentum uncertainty of electron = R/hbar. The average velocity of the electron in the hydrogen atom is momentum/electron mass = speed of light/137. Cool, huh? The non-relativistic energy of something moving at that speed is mv^2/2. Plugging in numbers, using 511 KeV for the electron mass, and 1/137 for the fine struct const, we get E = 511KeV / (2 (137)^2) = 13.6 eV. So the uncertainty principle applied to the atomic radius gives us ''exactly'' the ground state energy of hydrogen. Cool, huh?  Its quite amazing that this jig-saw fits together in this way. [[User:Linas|linas]] 17:35, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
::typo. Should be  momentum uncertainty of electron =  hbar/R  . Other than that, what you say is pretty groovy, but isn't it the case that the Bohr radius was DEFINED as that distance such that this calculation you're doing does come out exactly? The electron cloud is a fuzzy ball, so to give it a nominal radius, you pick Bohrradius = hbar 137 / mc. Or am I missing something? [[User:GangofOne|GangofOne]] 20:00, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

::::The [[Bohr radius]] isn't normally defined to make this relation come out; (although I suppose one could, if one really wanted to). I believe that the current "textbook definition" would be that it's the RMS radius of the ground-state solution to the [[Schroedinger equation]] for hydrogen. As Yevgeny points out below, the sign is wrong, and contemplating that can yield further interesting insight. [[User:Linas|linas]] 00:32, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

::: Linas, regarding your last paragraph above, where you calculate the energy of the hydrogen atom: it's a nice example, but for the article "ground state energy" rather than "zero-point energy". And your sign is wrong (positive instead of negative). The reason for the sign error is that you don't take the potential energy into account. Energy eigenvalues in quantum mechanics describe the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy, not just the kinetic energy.

::: Is the zero-point energy of the hydrogen atom "infinity minus 13.7", like you interpreted my approach? I would say yes. (There could be some cutoff in that classical theory though.)

::: Sorry, I didn't understand the claim at the beginning of the first paragraph of your response, but I won't argue, since it ends with the words "it can be sort-of excused" :). Then you're talking about E^2=p^2+m^2, but this is true only while the particle is not interacting. Description of interacting particles is described by a Hamiltonian involving fields, and you can add a constant to the Hamiltonian (and this wouldn't affect the equations of motion of the field). An example of a situation where a constant is naturally added to the Hamiltonian is a spontaneous symmetry breaking. This constant contributes to the vacuum energy together with the zero-point energy.

::: I agree with your solid-state example, but I don't understand how it is relevant to our controversy. [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 21:07, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

::::I didn't realize it was much of a controversy. I did get nervous by the claim that the zero point energy is the differerence between the classical and quantum systems. It's not clear to me that this is the correct definition, but it certainly does raise interesting questions. If you insist, I suppose it can go into the article, but I'm not sure what purpose it serves. Certainly, I'm having trouble understanding how to compare the energy of classical and quantum systems, and I'd like to think of myself as a bit smarter than the average reader.  I'm willing to compare the energy of classical and quantum harmonic oscillators, and also for SSB/Higgs-type mechanisms, since the interactions are quadratic. It's not clear that taking such a difference works for more complex systems; I find the "infinite" energy difference (or Planck-scale energy, if you wish) between the classical and quantum hydrogen/planetary system to be ... strange .. and thought provoking.

:1) For whatever social/cultural reasons, the rate of participation by physicists in WP is considerably lower than the participation rate of mathematicians. Many articles haven't been written yet, or are in poor condition.

:2) Articles on popular or general-interest topics are difficult to create and maintain (witness conversations above). The subject specialists are often overwhelmed by the onslaught of entropy, degeneration and decay, as well-meaning but ill-informed editors make detrimental edits. Its exhausting to monitor these and beat them back. (Its a lot more satisfying to write highly specialized articles; as so the unwashed masses leave one alone. This is why the WP articles on arcane topics are excellent, while those on high-school-level topics are a wasteland of misinformation.) [[User:Linas|linas]] 03:52, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

I am formulating a draft guideline to help suggest possible courses of action to future Wikipedians who notice a suspicious pattern of edits, in which I hope to incorporate my discussion with several other users concerning this incident.  ---[[User:Hillman|CH]] 02:36, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

:An interesting survey with encouraging results.  I'd like to make a comment in defense of the Manchester, England anon, numbered 7 above.  As the article on [[Planck's constant]] makes clear, the constant is given in two forms.  The usual Planck's constant is 2π times bigger than the so-called ''reduced Planck's constant''; the former is written with an ordinary letter h, while the latter is written with an h plus a crossbar.  So rather than subtle vandalism, the anon was exactly right: h-bar is (the unreduced) Planck's constant divided by 2π.  If my understanding is right, this changes the stats to 6, 2, and 2, rather than 5, 2, and 3.  Oh, and we should put the 2π back.

:[[User:ACW]]

You are quite right; basically, I misread ''[[Planck's constant]/2/&pi;'' as ''2 &pi;''.---[[User:Hillman|CH]] 17:59, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:Right; the anonymous editor did flub eir markup, by getting the /2π inside the outer pair of wiki-brackets (does anybody else call these "wickets"?), which made it hard to see what was going on.  Anyway, an editor deemed the whole section dubious, and moved it to this talk page, so the question is moot, at least for the moment.  (And thank for covering for me forgetting to sign.)

==Edit by the ''Tele Norge anon''==

{{user|193.216.163.239}} (Tele2 Norge AS. Dynamic IP pool near [[Oslo]]) added this paragraph:

''"Despite these circumstances, the search for devices tapping the zero point energy has a certain fundamental scientific basis, given that in the Casimir effect, zero point energy is translated into work on the macroscopic scale by the movement and welding-together of the metal plates. Those supportive of the idea of free energy devices argue that although the zero point energy may or may not be removed from the system, it is already proven to do actual work in physical experiments, and hence is a viable area of research."''

Tele2 Norge, can you explain what you have in mind?  If zero-point energy cannot be removed from "the system", how can it be used to generate electric power or whatever? (I.e. transmitted over power lines to light a bulb in someone's study.)  ---[[User:Hillman|CH]] 07:17, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

==Article's statement not entirely clear==
The article states, without any explanation
:"''Because zero point energy is the lowest possible energy a system can have, this energy cannot be removed from the system.''"
And goes on to prove from that that no device could ever "tap" a particles zero-point energy, or extract energy from it. However, to a non-physicist, this doesn't seem entirely obvious. If a trapped elementary particle is required by Heisenberg's principle to have some finite momentum, then it would seem to me (a non-physicist) that it's momentum could never-the-less be lowered, without it ever hitting zero. That is, Heisenberg's principle doesn't appear to state that the particle's momentum must necessarily be the smallest possible momentum of that particle.

This isn't to say that anything in the article is incorrect, just that it doesn't make clear why this is not the case. Could some explanation for the statement quoted above be inserted? &mdash; [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] | [[User talk:Asbestos|<FONT COLOR="#808080">Talk </FONT>]] [[User:Asbestos/RFC|<FONT COLOR="#808080"><small>(RFC)</small></FONT>]] 16:58, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

==Merge with [[Vacuum energy]]==

I placed the merge tag on the article. As far as I understand the two articles are about the same issue. The article in fact states: ''"In quantum field theory, it is a synonym for the [[vacuum energy]]..."''. If the two issues are different, then the articles should make this difference clear. At the moment they do not. They are hardly even aware of each other, except for the "synonym" reference. [[User:Petri Krohn|Petri Krohn]] 00:52, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

No to the merge, as the suggestion is based on a faulty premise. The terms "vacuum energy" and "zero-point energy" are not the same. This article explains how these terms differ. You say so yourself: ''"In quantum field theory, it is a synonym for the [[vacuum energy]]..."'' however, in other caes, they are *not* synonyms. In particlar, simple oscillators have a zero-point energy. Also, there is a concept of zero-point energy in solid-state physics, as the zero-point motion of atoms near absolute zero. Its implicated in sperfluid/superconductivity effects; there is definitely no "vacuum". The term "vacuum energy" applies to quantum fields, and not to individual oscillators. Finally, the idea of "zero-point energy" attrcts a lot of crank science types, I wish to keep these sepeated and corralled in this article, as opposed to letting them run loose through legit articles.

::Look, I really don't understand why you are being so pushy about this. Zero-point energy and vacuum energy are not the same thing, and they should not be confused with one another. All I get from your arguments is that you seem to think that they are the same thing. What is the scientific basis for your editorial desires? Do you actually have any credentials in quantum field thoery?  For the record, my PhD thesis was on the vacuum energy of the quark field in the chiral bag [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TVP-46P3Y4C-D3&_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1990&_alid=384817109&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=5540&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e8817348ed9e817eb66b95e2135a16f8], so I feel that I have a pretty good grasp on the topic.

I would say that most readers who look up "Zero-point energy" would be primarily interested in the lowest energy state of vacuum. Petri's original proposal makes sense to me.--[[User:Ytrottier|Yannick]] 05:40, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

These merge requests waste a lot of time for all involved.  If the ''Encyclopedia of Particle Physics'' (Gibbon, 2000) can have separate, almost full-page, entries on these topics, I don’t see why ''Wikipedia Encyclopedia'' can’t as well have separate entries.  From what I quickly read, we have two separate non-merge-able topics:

*'''Zero-point energy''' is the energy associated with a particle or system, over and above its mass-energy, at the absolute zero of temperature.

*'''Vacuum energy''' is the lowest-energy state of spacetime filled with virtual particle energy fields related or due to quantum uncertainty.

Furthermore, whenever someone puts up a questionable merge; then later, down the road, when the article goes over 32 kilobytes, someone else will have to spend time breaking up the article. --[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 23:15, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:The ''Encyclopedia of Particle Physics'' is a specialised text, whereas Wikipedia is aiming for a general audience. I don't have a problem with two separate articles, but I still maintain that '''Zero-point energy''' should refer to the lowest-energy state of spacetime, reflecting common usage, or at least to a disambiguation. The zero point energy of an arbitrary quantum oscillator (not spacetime) is a specialised topic of interest to a much smaller audience, so a title such as '''Zero-point energy (quantum mechanics)''' would be more appropriate. '''Vacuum energy''' would then be merged to '''Zero-point energy'''.--[[User:Ytrottier|Yannick]] 02:25, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::I disagree with the last statement. WP serves not only a general-interest audience, but also high-school students, college students, grad students and working academics/professors/engineers/specialists.

== Lowest state of energy ? ==

I understand that zero point energy is not a usable energy source.
Energy can not come out of it, its no perpetuem mobile.

Its a state discription and not a flow or drain where our energy can freely endup

But in physics particles can arise from nothing in a vacuem, together with their anti particles.
At the quantum scale this happens so frequently that our world as we know it would not exist without this effect.
Altough even hard to imagine to me, those 'virtual' particles are needed in the quantum mechanics world.

The Einstein formula is an 'atomic' formula not a quantum formula.

<b>So does this concept of zeropoint energy only aply to atom physics in the old physics model ?</b>

Or is zero point energy not that zero perhaps a noisy zero
As other wise i cannt imagine what would drive these virutal particle creations.
If that is true what would then be the 'new' Quantu mechanics (QM) concept of the lowest energy state of an cubic empy space of a given size?. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/82.217.143.153|82.217.143.153]] ([[User talk:82.217.143.153|talk]]) 15:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->

:You are attempting to distinguish "first quantization" (sometimes called "[[atomic physics]]") from [[second quantization]], which is the quantization of fields. This is a good distinction to make.

== Casimir Effect not proof of ZPE ==

Although the Casimir Effect was postulated on the hypothesis of ZPE, there are other explanations for the effect. R Jaffe, at MIT, recently argued that it could be explained in classical E/M terms. See http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0503158.

Maybe the section that mentions Casimir should be a litle more circumspect on this. --[[User:Lutin|lutin]] 21:43, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

:I skimmed the preprint, and Jaffe is, in a certain sense, correct. The Casimir effect is "just" a one loop correction, just as the [[Lamb shift]] is, or other common one-loop corrections. The cosmological vacuum energy is a different beast. Surely, even [[Steven Weinberg]] would agree; unfortunately, in the past, Weinberg, along with almost all traditional, mainstream authors, have helped confuse the concept of a one-loop correction with the concept of the vacuum state: and for good reason, as they are not unrelated. However, untangling these properly, and doing so in a forum like wikipedia, may prove somewhat difficult. So while Jaffe has a point, its may be too subtle to try to incorporate this into the current article. [[User:Linas|linas]] 16:18, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

== Rewrite rejected ==

I tried to rewrite this article to clarify the whole Casimir thing. Casimir forces are Van-Der Waals forces in the limit that the separation of objects is big enough. Big enough is compared to the distance light travels in a typical excited state period. This is the difference between London force and Casimir force, and this is what Casimir calculated in 1947.

The casimir force can be calculated as the difference in zero point energy of the electromagnetic field in different boundary conditions. All these boundary conditions do is take into account the different polarizabilities of the different materials which are now too far to be entangled. So they contribute a local boundary condition to the E-M field, and the attraction becomes universal.

That this calculation can be calculated from differences in the field energy in different boundary conditions is not contested. But the idea that this tells you something about the vaccuum energy is ridiculous. The vaccuum energy can always be defined to be zero, and only differences between different states are defined. The different states are different boundary conditions.

Perhaps it is impossible to get this page changed to reflect these facts. But they are facts, and they will not change.[[User:Likebox|Likebox]] 21:09, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

Does [[Burkhard Heim]]'s work have anything to do with zero-point energy? --[[User:Emesee|Emesee]] 15:31, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

== too technical ==

Yes, I can't for the life of me understand this article, as I am not a PhD quantum physicist. Unless there's no way to describe it in layman's terms without first learning about all the terms it discusses and spending years in university this belongs in a science wiki somewhere. Anyway, this is what I wanted to find out http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/research/warp/possible.html.

{{cquote|''Zero Point Energy (ZPE), or vacuum fluctuation energy are terms used to describe the random electromagnetic oscillations that are left in a vacuum after all other energy has been removed. If you remove all the energy from a space, take out all the matter, all the heat, all the light... everything -- you will find that there is still some energy left. One way to explain this is from the uncertainty principle from quantum physics that implies that it is impossible to have an absolutely zero energy condition.

For light waves in space, the same condition holds. For every possible color of light, that includes the ones we can’t see, there is a non-zero amount of that light. Add up the energy for all those different frequencies of light and the amount of energy in a given space is enormous, even mind boggling, ranging from 10^36 to 10^70 Joules/m3.

In simplistic terms it has been said that there is enough energy in the volume the size of a coffee cup to boil away Earth’s oceans. - that’s one strong cup of coffee! For a while a lot of physics thought that concept was too hard to swallow. This vacuum energy is more widely accepted today.''}}

I don't see how they relate, what energy are they talking about that is this 10^36 to 10^70 joules/m3 what does it have to do with zero point energy? Anyway, I wonder what could be done with that energy if could harness it, if it could be used for making wormholes and the like, or getting a ship up to near light speed [[User:The snare|The snare]] 07:44, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

: This is the central problem with this article--- it misinforms almost purposefully. The zero point of energy is, putting gravity aside, a matter of convention. I could say that "empty space has 50 zillion megajoules per micron cubed" or I could say "empty space has 0 energy", or I could say "empty space has minus 50 zillion megajoules per micron cubed" and I would be right.

:Gravity changes things, because energy makes gravity. So if there's gravity you can measure the energy content of empty space. This is called the "cosmological constant", or the "dark energy", and it is measured to be very close to zero, but not quite. This is not important for anything on this page.

:It is not possible to harnass the energy in space, because to harnass the energy you need another state where there is less energy. You get energy when you move something from a state where it has high energy to a state where it has low energy. In order to harnass the energy of space, you would need to be able to change space to a state of lower energy. If this were possible, nature would have done it long ago, nucleating a bubble of "true vaccuum" out of quantum fluctuations, and destroying our universe.

:But when you look at empty space, there are things in it. This is a fact, and nobody contests it. The things we know about in empty space for sure:

: 1. Pion condensate--- there's a bunch of quarks and antiquarks which have made a relativistically invariant superfluid in which everything sits. This superfluid is detectable because it shakes, and the shaking we call "pion emmission". This was discovered by Nambu in 1960. Nobody contests this. The energy density of the pion condensate can be estimated by the difference in energy between different values, and its something like 100th of a nuclear mass in every nuclear volume, where a nuclear mass is the mass of a proton and a nuclear volume is the volume of a proton.

: 2. Higgs--- there's a field in space which gives everything mass. We know it's there because the ratio of the mass of two particles, the W and the Z, is predicted with perfect accuracy by assuming they both get their mass from this field. The masses of the quarks and electrons and the masslessness of neutrinos is completely explained by the interactions with this field. No doubt about this one either. Although you could think maybe it's made of some new "techniquarks", like the pion condensate is made of quarks, but who knows. We'll measure it soon.

: 3.  Flucuation energy--- If we look at fields in space, we see that they have fluctuations. What that means is that it is impossible to have zero electric fields and magnetic fields at the same time, by the uncertainty principle. Electric fields and magnetic fields are complementary, because the electric field and the vector potential are like position and momentum. So there's energy in these fluctuations, which is naively infinite.

:But again, since only energy differences are defined, there is no way to harnass any vaccuum energy unless you have another state to move the vaccuum into. There is no such state. For example, maybe there's an enormous value of the Higgs field where it has slightly less energy than in our universe. Then the universe would be unstable to nucleation, a process where a big bubble of Higgs in the true vaccuum would be formed.

:This page is concerned with producing the misimpression that vaccuum energy means something else than what it does. It is trying to make it sound like you can run your car on empty space. This is unfortunate, because it associates the name of a good honest physicist (Casimir) with a radical and implausible idea that I don't think he would ever hold.[[User:Likebox|Likebox]] 01:39, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

You said we would have to be a lower point than zero point energy to be able to use it, but isn't that possible if we are at a negative energy state? Just asking here, don't really know, but does the Casimir effect show that negative energy does exist when you put two uncharged plates so close together that not even an atom can fit between them, that there will be "less than nothing" between them, causing them to be pulled together?

Here's something else I thought of, what if you had several uncharged plates at that distance from each other, but they were firmly attached to the ground/surface, etc. So that it could try to pull them together but couldn't? [[User:The snare|The snare]] 02:05, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
:You can't get to a negative energy state - that's the entire point.  Now, the [[Casimir effect]] pulls two plates together because there are fewer [[virtual particles]] between them than outside, but that doesn't let you do work - you can make a very lousy battery by pulling the plates apart, doing work in the process, and holding them there, then letting them collapse back when you want to get the energy out. [[User:Michaelbusch|Michaelbusch]] 04:05, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
You can get a negative energy state if you define regular open vacuum to be the zero state.  In the consideration of zero-point fields as electromagnetic radiation (uniform and Lorentz invariant, therefore undetectable), then lower frequency radiation is forbidden between two conductive plates due to its long wavelength.  Thus, the energy density between the two plates is negative if open vacuum is zero, since the lower end of the spectrum is forbidden.  It's this difference in energy densities that pushes the plates together.  It's pure speculation on my part that the enormous density of the zero-point energy doesn't make the universe collapse on itself because the zero-point field is the ether (again, Lorentz invariant), and gravity is only mass perturbations of the zero-point field.  I'm not sure about what utility that point of view has.  However, it's clear that specific boundary conditions change the behavior of the vacuum energy which has physical consequences, like the Casimir effect.[[User:DanFarnsy|DanFarnsy]] ([[User talk:DanFarnsy|talk]]) 12:35, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

==Dark Energy is not Vacuum Energy==

The term "dark energy" is associated with an unknown energy that has been found to be accelerating the expansion of the universe. This term was coined around 1998 when the effect was discovered from measuring the distance to supernovas of a type with a known brightness, and measuring their red shift, whereas quantum field theory dealing with vacuum energy started in the 1930s and 40s. These are separate ideas and should not be conflated.

The predicted (though probably wrong) energy of the ZPE is over 10^100 times more than it should be according to the CC. However the dark energy, including the energy in dark matter (another subject) is only 10 times more than CC predicts. These are very different things, nor should one automatically assume just one or the other is the real answer to the ZPF energy question. It deserves far more thought than a quick off the cuff answer. [[Special:Contributions/75.6.245.24|75.6.245.24]] ([[User talk:75.6.245.24|talk]]) 06:05, 10 January 2008 (UTC)


Part of Bernard Haisch's theories, IIRC, is that the vacuum energy/fields can provide a mechanism for acceleration of particles in the cosmic voids, like cosmic rays at 10^21 eV, and also claims that this accounts for apparent acceleration of expansion without a need for invoking vague (but popular) dark energy.  The status of this is speculative, but does provide a potential link between dark energy and vacuum energy. [[User:DanFarnsy|DanFarnsy]] ([[User talk:DanFarnsy|talk]]) 12:42, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

==Extracting energy==

:The above comment concerns the phrase:
::''[[As of 2006]], mainstream science does not believe that it is possible to extract usable energy from the vacuum.''
:which appears in the introduction. I re-inserted this sentence, its deletion was absurd at best. [[User:Linas|linas]] 19:49, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

Why absurd? I have seen no proof for this statement other than this article. Please provide a link to a reputable source for this. If you cannot, i will continue to remove it.
:Don't do any such thing.  Instead, cite a counterexample.  I think it's quite fair to say that if pseudoscientists claim something about physics, and mainstream scientists don't write any papers about it, that it's because the mainstream scientists don't think it's possible. -- [[User:SCZenz|SCZenz]] 02:50, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

That is not necessarily true. Mainstream scientist know that it exists by the Casimir effect and it being measured in 1959. But I am happy with the improvement. It claims that we cannot harness the energy for usable purposes yet, rather than claiming that there is no energy there to be harnessed for practical uses. Thank you for the correction

:The 1984 paper by Robert Forward (Phys. Rev. B 30: 1700) explicitly states that you ''can'' in principle extract energy.  This is straight from the references section of this article btw.  I'm not sure why this is even an issue?   Nobody is claiming that this is a practical possibility today.  At the same time, nobody is claiming that it is ''not'' a theoretical possibility - are they?  Can we get a counter-reference?   [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 00:26, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

::Can you articulate Forward's argument that energy extraction is possible? [[User:Linas|linas]] 01:01, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

:::Best look up the original article: [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v30/i4/p1700_1].  Forward talks about a reversible ZPE battery charge-discharge cycle, but the battery starts in the ''charged'' state as initially constructed (and without any corresponding energy input during construction).  The energy in the first discharge apparently comes straight from the vacuum. A more recent analysis (Cole & Puthoff, 1993, Phys. Rev. E 48, 1562–1565, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v48/i2/p1562_1]) confirms that conclusion. [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]]

::::I once read Forward's paper. I was wondering if *you* could articulate the argument. I agree that in principle, it is possible to build this "battery" and discharge it, and therefore suck energy out of it. However, this neglects the energy used to construct the thing in the first place. In particular, Forward's device is not a perpetual motion device. [[User:Linas|linas]] 02:25, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

:::::"neglects the energy used to construct the thing in the first place" - Not true - as I said there is no relation between the energy that can be extracted and the energy needed to build it.  What ''is'' the physical lower limit on the energy needed to build it, anyway?  (I would suggest that can be arbitrarily close to zero, but that depends on your definition of "build" as well - let us say "bring the components together into the correct configuration"?).  "not a perpetual motion device" - Obviously, since in any cycle of build-discharge-charge-unbuild energy will be exactly conserved.  Nonetheless, it is a device which extracts usable energy from the vacuum, which was the whole point.  You can argue that the components of the device are "fuel" which is consumed, but that would not be exactly correct: yes, they are consumed, but the energy does not come ''from'' them.  [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 02:32, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

::::The ''intent'' of the phrase "does not believe that it is possible to extract usable energy from the vacuum" was to say "mainstream science does not believe it's possible to build perpetual motion machines based on ZPE".  It was not the intent to exclude Forward's device, which, if I remember it correctly, struck me as a reasonable device. The problem is that the phrase "extract usable energy from the vacuum" sounds like "something for nothing"; Forward's device doesn't actually give you something for nothing (because there was a real energy cost to manufacture the thing). [[User:Linas|linas]] 02:35, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

:::::they wouldn't be "perpetual motion machines" since they don't violate conservation of energy, the energy just comes from the ZPE ;) [[User:ObsidianOrder|ObsidianOrder]] 02:34, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

::::Linas, your assumption that extracting useable energy from the vacuum has to be "something for nothing" strikes me as odd.  Solar power, wind power, and tidal harnesses are just as effectively "something for nothing," yet nobody argues that they violate thermodynamics.  Forward's device demonstrates that extraction of energy from the ZPF is possible without violating thermodynamics, and this result is confirmed by Cole/Puthoff later.  The "zero" in zero-point energy is really arbitrary, with the Dirac Sea, and particular geometrical configurations of matter can create negative energy densities, as in a Casimir Cavity, thus providing a potential energy gradient for energy extraction.

If you want to consider conservation of energy being violated, you need to consider everything - not just the thing that's gaining energy.  Anyway, this is a comment to make in a physics classroom, not the discussion board.

Dear Editors,

This (and the larger article on Zero-Point Energy) is a good example of why subatomic physics is a difficult, specialized field, and why articles on it are difficult to edit. I'll be brief here:

In the same way as a 'particle' is a theoretical construct -- i.e., 'subatomic particles' are not actually tiny bits of matter, but more like names that we use to categorize certain detectable phenomena -- 'Zero-Point Energy' does not necessarily describe energy in the thermodynamic sense. 

The identification of these observed variabilities with 'energy' is merely assumed for common-sense purposes (because according to common sense, if something is happening, 'energy' must be powering it). But if we are talking serious subatomic physics, what these phenomena demonstrate is variations in probability.  

So: 1) We are nowhere near the scaled-up, super-macro level of thermodynamics with these phenomena. They cannot violate (or follow) the Laws of Thermodynamics because our idea of so-called physical laws ultimately has to incorporate these phenomena, whatever they actually are. 2) Variations in probability is not only a far better model, but it's even more freaking interesting. BTW: The pop-quantum concept of easiest resort isn't Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (argh!), but Brownian Motion. It's a different thing, but it's at least in the same basic category of things. 

And as for whether you can power a perpetual-motion machine with Zero-Point Energy, that would seem to be a big, fat 'no' by definition. Average all of those miniscule variations and you get a consistent figure that may easily be measured at the everyday level. As everyone has long observed, that figure is expressible as zero.

== Might be neat ==

It might be neat to include some popular/news references to Zero Point.

== This whole article has problems ==

I recently removed an assertion by someone that there is no experimental evidence for zero point energy. It's beyond me how anyone could say that. This isn't to say there aren't extensive errors thoughout this article that need correction, but that statement was just so wrong I couldn't let it go. Physics is not about ironclad interpretations, but about preponderance of the evidence and the ability of an interpretation to solve problems in physics.

When I read this article it tends to remind me of the myth about the group of blind men feeling an elephant and each having a completely different interpretation based on the area of the body they are touching. Everyone contributing to this article has their little niche of expertise that they take as gospel and are unconcerned about how their interpretation affects the subject as a whole. It seems very self-centered and narrow to me.[[Special:Contributions/75.7.31.190|75.7.31.190]] ([[User talk:75.7.31.190|talk]]) 21:31, 29 July 2008 (UTC)

== History section ==

The following section of the article looked suspect to me, so I moved it here, for discussion:

:===History===
:''The concept of zero-point energy originated with [[Max Planck]] in 1911. The average energy of a harmonic oscillator in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings is: ''

::<math>E=
\frac{\hbar\omega}{2} + \frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\hbar\omega/kT}-1} 
</math>

:''Here, <math>\hbar</math> is [[Planck's constant]], <math>\omega</math> is the [[natural frequency]], ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is the [[temperature]].''

:''At the same time [[Albert Einstein]], [[L. Hopf]] ([[1910]]) and [[Otto Stern]] ([[1913]]) were also studying the properties of zero-point energy. Shortly thereafter [[Walther Nernst]] ([[1916]]) proposed that empty space was filled with zero-point [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Then in [[1925]] the existence of zero-point energy was shown to be “mathematically required by [[quantum mechanics]], as a direct consequence of [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]” (which in turn follows from the definition of [[operator]]s)  (Sciama [[1991]]).''

This section survives from one of the oldest versions of this article; it was added on 17:16, 19 April 2004 by [[User:68.166.190.130]] in this edit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zero-point_energy&diff=3419175&oldid=3258743]

The problem here is that these people couldn't have been studying what we call zero-point energy back then, because zero-point didn't exist as a concept until after the formulation of quantum mechanics. This section almost makes sense if we substitute "black-body radiation" for "zero-point energy". Unfortunately, the study of black-body radiation predates Planck; what Planck did in 1911 was to derive a formula for its spectral density.

Of course, Einstein and others were studying black-body radiation at that time; the famous [[UV catastrophe]] had been singled out by Lord Kelvin years earlier as one of the great unsolved problems for the 20th century. I'm not at all clear what it is that Nernst may have claimed. The magic unreferenced 1925 date is utterly un-illuminating.

Last but not least, the connection between black-body radiation and zero-point energy in such a historical way is vague at best; a real connection doesn't come until the discovery of Unruh radiation in the 1970's... it seems that there is little or nothing to salvage here that's appropriate for this article.  [[User:Linas|linas]] 16:22, 27 May 2006 (UTC)


::Plancks equation really should be explained in the article.
::''Here, <math>\hbar</math> is [[Planck's constant]], <math>\omega</math> is the [[natural frequency]], ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is the [[temperature]].''

----
I also am under the impression that the historical reference to Einstein and Stern's paper is a bit vague. I have just taken a look at it, and the authors seems to credit the ZPE to Planck himself, confirming the comment above. When introducing the ZPE they refer to "Planck's second formula". Hence it seems to me a bit strong to say that ZPE was introduced by Einstein and Stern in that article [Ann. Phys 40, 551 (1913)].
As far as I understand they show that including the ZPE and _assuming that the frequency depends on temperature_ one gets a better agreement with the experimental
data for the (rotational) specific heat of molecular Hydrogen.
I am currently trying to understand why people was (apparently) so concerned about ZPE before it came about in Schroedinger's equation. It must have been some inconsistency with experimental data. Some undergraduate books skirt the subject, but they are not really helpful. [[User:Moulinski|Moulinski]] ([[User talk:Moulinski|talk]]) 16:11, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

==Quantum Vortex==
Here is the material I keep cutting and an explanation why I am cutting it:
:"Another vacuum source of zero-point energy is the quantum vortex."[7]
There are no "sources of vacuum energy".  This statement lack an antecedent basis
:"A quantum vortex[8] uses the outer orbital spin of the electron"
Quantum vortex's do not use anything.  Using techinical words without recognition of their meaning is a hallmark of psuedoscience
:"to pass excited atoms through the Casimir-like inner cavity of the electron itself,[9]"
The cavity of a quantuum vortex is not an electron - this is babble.  Probably from deleted sources 8 and 9 which like that fancy sounding word.  See [[quantum vortex]] ("a quantum vortex is a hole with the superfluid circulating around the vortex; the inside of the vortex may contain excited particles, air, vacuum")
:"whose structure expresses electromagnetic cavity modes at the transition frequency between the atom's excited and ground states."
This explains nothing about demonstrating zero point energy, or extracting it (this material has appeared in both free energy and experimental evidence sections)
:"With the introduction of the zero point radiation a vacuum at absolute zero is no longer considered empty. Instead, the vacuum is now considered as filled with randomly fluctuating fields having the zero-point radiation spectrums."

== Urok ==

Urok,
By now you should realize that the specific material you are trying to insert won't be accepted. You are just creating problems for yourself as well as others. Extraordinary claims requires extraordinary proof. In general what that means isn't neccessarily mathematical proof but logical proof. Logical proof means it can be understood by individuals without specialized education in that subject. It requires a slow building up of ideas from first principles that are almost irresistable. And the more it opposes current theory the larger that irresistable accrual of ideas must be.

What I see you doing instead is just making claims without any "logical" proof.  Mathematics, in general comes from modeling visual ideas and not vice versa and is not sufficient as proof. There are plenty of examples in references that look mathematically appealing but doesn't model anything in nature accurately. Einstein said that if you can't your explain your ideas to your grandmother then you probably don't understand it. While that might be a slight exageration its basically true. I think you should start thinking about what you are working on in terms of explaining it to someone with good, but not specialized knowledge. And it has to be build up from specific understanding of previous scientific knowledge that you can also explain to this person. Because you are making such extraordinary claims this is the absolute minimum required.

I'm also seeing you completely ignoring previous knowledge that is well established about vacuum energy. Any irresistable argument must use these ideas as the foundation. And if you are coming to different conclusions using those proven building blocks you have to elaborately show the previous reasons for those ideas while giving a good reason for now looking at them from a slightly different angle. You can't just ignore them as you are now.

If you don't do any of these things you can continue to expect deletions.[[Special:Contributions/75.7.28.7|75.7.28.7]] ([[User talk:75.7.28.7|talk]]) 22:13, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

== New Energy News Question ==

New Energy News and the Institute for New Energy raise very serious criticisms of the politics of science, namely, that, even if scientists do repeat valid experiments, the flow of knowledge through society is damagingly slow and stubborn due to the inertia of village thinking and (don't run scared now) PR attack campaigns.

New Energy News is here: <ref>http://www.padrak.com/ine/</ref>

If anyone believes that "news" (or dominant thinking) is a reliable source of information for Wikipedia, stop and remember the hundreds of false stories (in war politics) about Jessica Lynch, Pat Tillman, and WMD: for citations, see the books "So wrong for so long" and "You are being lied to" and "Cowboy Politics" and "You're Not Stupid" and "Chain of Command".

Wikipedia is bound to get suckered again and again, and human information systems need to get fixed, quickly, not least due to energy and other problems facing the world.

All of this is to raise a question:

NEN and INE (named above) allege that in fact cold fusion has been widely replicated, and that, for whatever reason, those reports are an open secret.  How can citizens concern with the truth deal with such claims?

I can't assess scientific claims one way or another, but it would seem exceedingly naive to assume that PR (or whatever media) distortions have been active ONLY in war politics.

Further, what about this device that NEN and INE point to as seeming to represent a revolutionary source of energy:

Methernitha Swiss M-L Converter developed by Paul Baumann

This is from INE<ref>http://www.padrak.com/ine/INE21.html</ref>:

== Glaring conceptual problem ==

Just thought I'd mention this. Several places in this article it mentions that the ZPF might be infinite. And I suppose this can be considered correct if each new volume that is added to the universe as it expands is assigned the same constant planck length energy. In other words there is no cutoff to the energy as the volume of the universe expands. So as long as the universe expands then the energy is infinite. And it is also said in this article that only differences in energy are measureable.

There are many logical errors to this. I'll try to name them.

1. Energy is the most fundamental "thing" in the universe. To say only differences in energy can be measured is true but not in the way you are assuming the universe works. This only works in the difference between potential and kinetic energy. If you add something to one side of the ledger you subtract it from the other. The universe as it is currently conceptualized assumes a positive (the zpf energy) and a negative energy that is "instantaneously" created. Each you new volume that is added to the universe as it expands is assigned this "instantiated" energy. And because this instantiated energy together equals zero then technically energy is conserved. This patently disagrees with conservation of energy and the first law of thermodynamics.
:You need to research the history of science and the formulation of the definition of energy.  Read a thermodynamics textbook or Richard Faynman's Lectures on Physics.  What happens on the scale of the entire universe, or a hypothetical still greater scale, is so far departed from the evidence on which conservation of energy has been formulated and tested that is nearly irrelevant to the discussion.  Your first sentence here seems to be a matter of gratiuitous faith.[[Special:Contributions/75.33.44.214|75.33.44.214]] ([[User talk:75.33.44.214|talk]]) 13:07, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

::I read Feynman's lectures on physics books and have gotten a lot of understanding from them. But even he had blind spots. For instance when a Phd candidate wanted to research Einstein's EPR paper he chased the guy out of his office! I think you are confusing being open minded about the fundamentalness of energy with the need for a constraint in a system. To have any hope to come up with a useable prediction for a theory requires a constrained system. It doesn't mean there might not be something outside of our universe but it does means anything outside of our universe has no meaning whatsovever in our analysis of OUR universe. Energy is the most logical thing to place the fundamental constraint on for our universe to have any hope at all of making sense of our universe.

::I should add one more thing. The conventional view of the ZPF where each new Planck volume is assigned the same energy is exactly like creating a new identical quantum universe that is added to the existing sum of quantum universes as the universe expands. But if that is true then why has the radiation temperature of the CMBR lowered as the universe expanded. See, there is a constraint![[Special:Contributions/75.7.7.247|75.7.7.247]] ([[User talk:75.7.7.247|talk]]) 23:13, 31 May 2009 (UTC)


2. Why should there be a negative energy or something that acts as a negative energy source to the energy we all know and love. There is no scientific evidence for it.

3. For the zpf energy (i.e. the positive side of the energy equation) to have infinite energy assumes the universe will expand forever. Well, it might but it is far from an established fact.

4. The concept of zero "observed" zpf energy which invoked the requirement for "instantiation" of negative energy doesn't hold true for these two reasons:

a. The universe is accelerating its expansion. (See confirmed evidence from redshift of type 1a supernovae.

b. The temperature of the space has been proven to be reduced as the universe expands via the CMB radiation.

In summary there are many logical fallacies for the current conception of ZPE. There is an error in a mathematical assumption somewhere that leads us to project the constant Planck length zpf energy density. Don't worry. I'm not going to try to edit the article to point out and fix these errors. I feel that the individuals that put in the work on an article should try to do that. But I owe it to you to put you on the right track to help you do it without being too obtrusive.[[Special:Contributions/75.7.21.10|75.7.21.10]] ([[User talk:75.7.21.10|talk]]) 22:05, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

== I thought Zero-point energy is an alleged source of "free" energy? ==

The NGIC paper is nonsense.  I've read it in detail.  To say that converting energy from the vacuum is pseudoscience means to start with that the authors do not understand the phenomenon.  The Casimir effect alone is "free" energy from the vacuum.  If not, what energy pushes the plates together?  Where is the loss or the inefficiency?  No energy must be inserted into the Casimir effect in order to make it happen.  This part of the article is plain silly and should be removed.  If there was no getting energy from the vacuum then Van der Waals wouldn't work.  Each of these ARE demonstrations of getting energy "for free" from the vacuum.  The engineering difficulty is getting energy continuously or enough periodically that an efficient generator can be built.  There has been no scientific proof that this cannot be done.  Just because nobody has constructed one yet doesn't make it pseudoscience.  I'd suggest the authors of this paper were pushing their own brand of pseudoscience to reroute funding from such projects to something else they wanted to spend their limited budgets on.

The intro of the current version of this article doesn't seem to be saying much of anything.

** Dear Efilnickufesin, if you "don't have time to read them or read the rest of the article", please don't edit the article. Besides that, there are several problems with the things you wrote: (1) In the Casimir effect, the force between the plates is attractive, not repulsive; (2) In the Casimir effect, the plates are brought close to each other since then the force is bigger (see formula), and not because air molecules cannot fit between the plates; (3) There is a separate article on the Casimir effect, so we shouldn't describe it again here; (4) You don't need the Casimir effect to provide an example for the zero-point energy - even the hydrogen atom is good enough; (5) It is an inaccurate statement that particles appear out of nothing in the vacuum. Vacuum is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, therefore nothing changes there; (6) It's not the place to discuss 'fights' between classical and quantum mechanics. An article on quantum mechanics or articles linked from there are the appropriate place. For these reasons, I undid your changes. If you still think that some of them should be included, let's discuss them here first. [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 07:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Re vacuum == nothing, yes, hamiltonian says it isn't nothing, but most people see the world through perceptual organs that perceive aggregate, classical-type phenomena, and believe vacuum == nothing.

Their appropriate reaction would be to engage in the same behaviour, and produce more and more of these 'zero point energy' devices and other mystical toys that they don't understand, and won't have explained to them - since they can see, and rightly so, that your arguments consist mostly of ego, with a bit of hocus-pokus thrown in, and stop reading before you get to the actual point.
:::The fact is that if you do not present a simple example, that is "intuitively" understandable, at the start, people won't read the page. If you put such an example later on, they won't read the page. The intuitive example will be missed.

:::Because it is an example which uses human-scale objects, and produces completely counter-intuitive results, the Casimir effect is a much better example than some hydrogen-atom thingo -- which you didn't even bother to describe or replace my example with -- and because of the counter-intuitive results and the fact that zero point energy is a qm phenomenon, of <b>course</b> it is necessary for a non-qm-educated person to be informed that there is a difference between qm phenomena and intuitive/classical descriptions of the world, and briefly have summarised for them what that difference is and what type of difference it is, and the relative newness of qm.
:::You need to learn that communication, and especially wiki, is about cooperation between disparate people, with differing skills and knowledge. So you believe you know more physics than me.

I didn't scratch the entire page, I added my contribution, adapting a small part and fleshing it out. You shouldn't have removed my entire contribution, you should have adapted a small part and refined it or corrected it.
:::Note I wrote most of this before I confirmed that I was in fact not completely wrong about the Casimir force, and so I have perhaps been more polite than I should in responding. But since I don't have time to completely satisfy myself of the correctness of my argument or the incorrectness of Yevgeny's, I will leave my reply somewhat ambiguous. Someone needs to check carefully whether the Casimir effect is accurately described, and whether there is a better candidate for an example. Please take into account that the example should be understandable and "of consequence" to people who are not yet educated in subatomic physics.

::::To say that "Science and maths, contrary to popular belief, are not magic, and not religion" may not be quite so true as they were once perceived. If one reads "The Field" by Lynn McTaggart as an introduction to zero point energy and related physics, biology, physiology and medical topics, then much of what is described about the action of the brain as a mechanism for interacting with The Field (aka zero-point energy) seems to go some way towards explaining aspects of religion and aspects of magic.
::::I offer one example for each in support of this proposal.
::::Some religions acknowledge a god, some acknowledge multiple gods, some point to a being of vastly greater intelligence / presence (e.g. Gaia), astronomers refer to the mising mass, Einstein talked about E=mc². All of these have a common factors - not visible to the eye, significant energy, vast size, not easy to understand. The prevalence of religion among human cultures, together with the associated links to spirit, points to thought as a causal and linking factor. With the brain acting as a complex store cum energy manipulation device, it is in effect acting as a transducer, sensing (receiving) and interacting with (sending) the zero-point energy field. (my regrets if the simplification has glossed over or missed out much of the underlying logic).
::::For Magic, the matter is both simpler yet more complex. If we take the Magic (paranormal) definition of Magic from Wikipedia itself, the first entry in the Examples box is about Healing Others. Elisabeth Targ and Fred Sicher showed in their 1988 study of distant healing that some effect of human activity on others - by thought alone - had produced a statistically significant effect. If we accept that the human brain is an (unreliable) transducer to link with the zero-point energy field, this would go a long way towards explaining a) why the experiment succeeded and b) why zero-point energy manipulation is "Magic".[[User:1stonery|1stonery]] 03:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

I don't have the knowledge to even attempt to edit this article but I do think it's pretty dismissive of the idea of using Zero Point for energy, as some people have already said. I agree that it's wrong to label this pseudoscience. For example, ZPE does not as far as I'm aware violate any laws if it gets the energy from other dimensions which I believe many physicists speculate exist. There appear to be a number of unexplained over-unity phenomena out there (e.g. "cold fusion" and ZPE may well be the underlying cause.

:The pseudoscience label is based on the sources, not the content.  As a theoretical idea, zero point energy is legitimized by scientific presentation, analysis, and discussion, but as a feasible source of energy, the pseudoscience label is earned by:
:(1) lack of work appearing in peer-reviewed publications
:(2) lack of reproducible experiments
:(3) lack of complete, credible, and well articulated theoretical positions.

:There are also secondary indications of pseudoscience:
:(1) arguing the case primarily to those who are unfamiliar with the background science
:(2) an ulterior motive behind the alleged science, especially seeking "investment"
:(3) incomprehensible "explanations" that make liberal use of high-sounding jargon.

== not a consequence of heisenberg uncertainty ==

the intro calls this a "consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle".  this is not true.  not anymore than anything in quantum physics is a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle.  the heisenberg principle is just a mathematical statement that can be derived from the shrodinger equation.  as can zpe.  zpe is more properly a consequence of the fact that a charged particle about another is confined by coloumb forces in a parabolic well, and by definition it can't have negative energy.  putting these factors into the time-independant shrodinger equation (solved in this case by dirac - which he won a nobel prize for)  you discover that the only way to avoid negative energy values is to have a non-zero energy "ground state".   to say that the value of a possible quantum energy state -- i.e. the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian -- is due to the uncertainty principle is non-sensical.

== Derivation Details ==

The derivation is sparse in details. I would like to amend it to something like the following...

Near the bottom of a [[potential well]], the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a system (the quantum-mechanical [[operator (physics)|operator]] giving its energy) can be approximated as

::<math>\hat{H} = E_0 + \frac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2</math>

where <math>E_0</math> is the minimum of the classical potential well.

Therefore, the expectation of <math>\hat{H}</math> is

::<math> \left\langle \hat{H} \right\rangle = E_0 + \left\langle \frac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle + \left\langle \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle</math>

Since <math>(a-b)^2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow a^2 + b^2 \geq 2ab</math>, <math>(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab \geq 4ab</math>, or equivalently (for positive a and b) <math>a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}</math>. This means the above equation is bounded from below by:

::<math> \left\langle \hat{H} \right\rangle \geq E_0 + 2\sqrt{ \left\langle \frac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle \left\langle \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle }</math>.

The uncertainty principle tells us that

::<math>\sqrt{\left\langle \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle} \sqrt{\left\langle \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},</math>

making the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]s of the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]] terms above satisfy

::<math>\left\langle \frac{1}{2} k \left(\hat{x} - x_0\right)^2 \right\rangle \left\langle \frac{1}{2m} \hat{p}^2 \right\rangle \geq \left(\frac{\hbar}{4}\right)^2 \frac{k}{m}.</math>

The expectation value of the energy must therefore be at least

::<math>\left\langle \hat{H} \right\rangle \geq E_0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = E_0 + \frac{\hbar \omega}{2}</math>

where <math>\omega = \sqrt{k/m}</math> is the [[angular frequency]] at which the system oscillates.

Additionally the linked Wikipedia article on the film & character go in to this in depth.  Hopefully this's sufficient.

I reverted the removal of this section by unnamed user at 62.147.11.238.  It doesn't fit the definition under [[WP:Trivia]] and sections showing relevance in popular culture are fairly common.  The initial version also didn't cite fanfiction.net, I added that after a request for additional documentation of ZPE being tied to the character.  I have no affiliation with the site & was unaware of it until I researched this.  IMO this isn't cruft as it shows how a relatively esoteric idea has made its way in to broader awareness, and it's also useful as a gateway for getting kids interested in this field of science.
I made a Talk section about this partially because of the initial deletion, I'd appreciate it if we could have a conversation about it before it's simply deleted again.[[User:SLEPhoto|SLEPhoto]] ([[User talk:SLEPhoto|talk]]) 07:32, 3 October 2012 (UTC)

==Pop Culture References List==

Can we add a popular media sightings section? Although this would allow a non scientific section to an all physics page, zero point energy IS very widely recognised as one of the most falsified claims by fakers (perpetual motion and free-energy machines)

If so, I offer my sighting - The Incredibles, Pixar film, Buddy Pine/Syndrome has created a zero point energy wrist weapon.

:See [[Zero-point energy in popular culture]], which should be summarized in a section of this article, if you ask me.--[[User:Ytrottier|Yannick]] 02:54, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

I apologize, I missed this section & started a new one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Zero-point_energy#In_Popular_Culture when I added a section on pop culture that was reverted. I started it because there was no article, as noted below. [[User:SLEPhoto|SLEPhoto]] ([[User talk:SLEPhoto|talk]]) 07:46, 3 October 2012 (UTC)


===Two more references:===

[[Nadesico]]

[[Stargate]]

Also your link seems to go to a nonexistent page, with no new section in this article either.

== Adding New Experimental Evidence ==

I was just reading this article which would seem to be new experimental evidence.

Can someone who can properly integrate it into the page do so?
I feel that I don't have the experiance with WikiPedia to do it correctly :)

== "violating"... not the right word? ==

I realize that the laws of thermodynamics can not be "broken" of course, but I also realize that they are probabilistic laws in essence (particularly the second law), so as it is not to say that energy has to lose some to heat, just that it's extremely likely to. Violating the Laws sounds a bit too rigid,in this context, anyway. 
Just my 2c

== Gravitation and cosmology ==

In the section "gravitation and cosmology" it reads:

"One obvious difficulty with this association is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large. Naively, it is infinite, because it includes the energy of waves with arbitrarily short wavelengths. But since only differences in energy are physically measurable, the infinity can be removed by renormalization."

I think this is wrong, since gravitation (unlikie any of the other fundamental forces) senses absolute energy, not just energy differences. Thus, renormalization cannot resolve the conflict in the case of gravity.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.181.222.243|82.181.222.243]] ([[User talk:82.181.222.243|talk]]) 21:41, 20 July 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Under "List of unsolved problems in physics" it says,
"Why doesn't the zero-point energy density of the vacuum change with changes in the volume of the universe? (It is rotation and electromagnetic power)"
1 - Citation is needed that that is an unsolved problem. It is not listed on the linked page.
2 - Citation is needed that the density does not change with the changing volume of the universe. How do we know it does not change?
3 - What does this mean? "It is rotation and electromagnetic power" What is "it"? Please explain.

==History section==
The history section was originally added in this edit:[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zero-point_energy&type=revision&diff=103119683&oldid=102038845].  It was edited by [[User:Sadi Carnot]] who was blocked indefinitely because of various abuse.  Therefore, the content may be of suspect value.  In fact, it has one gross errors.  The vibrational energy formula

:<math> \epsilon = \frac{h\nu}{ e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1} + \frac{h\nu}{2}</math>

was actually given by Max Planck.  The references are here: 
[http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol4-doc/292]"The paper by Einstein and Otto Stern ... presents the results of their study of some ways in which the zero-point energy, introduced two years earlier by Max Planck in his second quantum theory, might affect physical phenomena", [http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1111/1111.4623.pdf]{{rp|7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DN-9m2jSo8YC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=einstein+stern+zero+point+energy&source=bl&ots=7MNFyoQRxg&sig=oZv0F_jKkfFwX1nVYsKkkoUa6rE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DJyHVc2JMdGwyAS8maXQCQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=einstein%20stern%20zero%20point%20energy&f=false]{{rp|48}}"When Max Planck introduced the concept of zero-point energy in 1911...", [https://books.google.com/books?id=LBhvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&dq=einstein+critical+opalescence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eOmFVeelOoSGyATvqJ4w&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=zero%20point&f=false]{{rp|133}}"...corresponding to the zero-point energy hv/2 that Planck ascribed to his resonators in his second theory of radiation."

== So-Called "mainstream" science/scientists. ==

Dear Public,
Please stop using this term - "mainstream". There is no such thing. There is science, and there are scientists, they are not a single body, nor are they all affiliated with each other or anything. Science is science. It is not a club, you do not need to purchase a membership. Science is a concept. You do not "join" or "sign up". 
If your pet hypothesis is having trouble being accepted by the scientific community, you are deluding yourself if you think that all of the scientists and scientific institutions have somehow got together to exclude it. I guarantee that if your pet concept had any legs, there would be someone out there who is willing to try and find evidence for it - someone from the *scientific* community. 
That is what science is - the testing of ideas against observations to formulate explanations and extrapolate predictions. If your concept fails to predict any meaningful observations, that is not a failure of "mainstream" science to adapt.
There are no scientists *outside the mainstream* because if there were, and they were worth their salt, they would be...well...pretty regular scientists. The idea that we all band together to "suppress" ideas that we don't like is preposterous, because that would be ignoring a pathway to a better explanation of whatever phenomena. Oh, I'm sure they are a few people out there who would pick and choose, manipulate data or ignore ideas because they are emotionally invested in some avenue of research, but there is always a certain percentage of bad apples in every group of people. Say it aint so.
Regards,
One tiny, infinitesimal part of the scientific community.[[Special:Contributions/178.15.151.163|178.15.151.163]] ([[User talk:178.15.151.163|talk]]) 08:45, 3 May 2016 (UTC)

== Problem with the last sentance ==

'''''Even though the zero-point energy is theoretically infinite, there is as yet no practical evidence to suggest that infinite amounts of zero-point energy are available for use, that zero-point energy can be withdrawn for free, or that zero-point energy can be used in violation of conservation of energy.[13]'''''

If you actually read reference 13, it states that there ''is'' an actual way to extract ZPE (the Casimir effect), and doing so ''doesn't'' violate the laws of thermodynamics... only that it's such a small amount of energy that it's completely useless.  It says that on pg 2.
[[User:Hhh3h|Hhh3h]] ([[User talk:Hhh3h|talk]]) 22:37, 29 February 2012 (UTC)

It is not useless because it is a small amount, since this can be scaled up arbitrarily - it is useless in the same way that the energy that can be "extracted" from two magnets, or a rubber band, is useless; energy has to be put into the system to bring the two plates apart again. You can start with two plates already separated, but that is a system already in a non-zero energy state - to extract energy from a system, the start and end states must be the same.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/178.15.151.163|178.15.151.163]] ([[User talk:178.15.151.163|talk]]) 08:53, 3 May 2016 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
