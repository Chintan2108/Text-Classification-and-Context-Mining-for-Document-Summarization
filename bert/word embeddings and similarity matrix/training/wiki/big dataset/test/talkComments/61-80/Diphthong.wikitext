::Good catch.  I've fixed the discrepancy. [[User:Aeusoes1|AEuSoes1]] 00:09, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:::Should it say 'falling' instead of 'rising' in this sentence? : "Note also that rising diphthongs are considered not true diphthongs by many phoneticians, but sequences of a consonant and a vowel."  Otherwise it does not seem to make sense with the list of Italian dipthongs.

::Actually, it's the other way around.  Think of "rising" and "falling" as in the IPA vowel chart.  If it's rising, it's going from one point in the chart to a higher position.  Falling diphthongs go from a high point to a lower point and centering ones go from a non-center point towards schwa.  As for falling diphthongs not being real diphthongs, I mentioned this elsewhere in the talk page but it really depends on the language.  In English, they wouldn't be (except maybe the /ju/ in ''cute'') but in Spanish they would be.  [[User:Aeusoes1|AEuSoes1]] 00:54, 12 March 2006 (UTC) 

:::Thanks for your help...I think maybe we are agreeing...however, the article states that "many phoneticians do not consider ''rising'' dipthongs to be real dipthongs, but sequences of a consonant and a vowel".  Does this mean that in Italian some people do not consider [ai] to be a real dipthong, but a sequence of a consonant and a vowel (if so, which vowel?) Sorry if I'm wrong about all of this.

:: Ahh, I didn't even see that.  I've fixed the discrepancy.  I'm assuming that since the sentence is in the Italian section that the statement only applies to Italian.  If it doesn't, then we might need to move it up before listing off the diphthongs of different languages. [[User:Aeusoes1|AEuSoes1]] 20:21, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

:::As I understand it, "falling" and "rising" diphthongs do ''not'' refer to relative positions in the IPA vowel chart (otherwise they would be synonymous with "opening" and "closing", and thus superfluous) but to whether the first element is stressed (falling) or the second (rising). Thus in English, "you" is rising and all the others are falling.

::::I would presume that the poster above meant that Japanese has no ''phonemic'' diphthongs, which is different from it having no diphthongs phonetically at actual realization.  This is similar to how, say, most NAE dialects only have three diphthongs /aɪ/, /aʊ/, and /ɔɪ/ (or equivalent) phonemically, and yet they have plenty of other diphthongs phonetically, such as [eɪ], [oʊ], and just any combination of [j] and [w] and a following nucleus vowel possible. -[[user:Travis B.|Travis]] 11:31, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

Yes, but in order to show that a diphthong is a phoneme you have to assume it is a phoneme in the first place. There is no definitive proof that this or that sound combination is or is not a phoneme using traditional phoneme criteria.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/133.7.7.240|133.7.7.240]] ([[User talk:133.7.7.240|talk]]) 11:35, 11 June 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Most phonology nowadays has nothing whatsoever to do with phonemes. Besides it's arbitrarily narrow to define a given diphthong as 'phonemic' only if you can put it in lexical opposition to another phoneme. How do we know how many diphthongal phonemes English has when we can't even get an agreed-to account of how many phonemes English has? What is often meant is that if you take some pronounced diphthongal vowels in , for example, American English, they don't form a contrast with a less diphthongal variation of a similar vowel. Diphthongs were originally conceived as phonetic descriptions anyway. Then phonemics got in the way, and now it's the obsolete little ugly duckling in the room.[[Special:Contributions/133.7.7.240|133.7.7.240]] ([[User talk:133.7.7.240|talk]]) 07:56, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

Well many here at wikilinguistics pages tend to use old sources and ones stuck in structuralist phonemics. Moreover, in the case of Japanese, things are made difficult by overlapping confusions of mora, syllable, long vowels forming the nucleus of one, no wait, two syllables (because they confuse mora with syllable), etc. So it is very difficult to make much progress in discussing the issues with them. Also, you have to remember in the case of a language like Japanese, descriptions of it, including phonological and phonetic, exist for and are motivated by different goals: 1. for native literacy, 2. for JSL & JFL learning, 3. for academic phonetics and phonology (themselves more and more not distinct fields).

==Various changes==
I have changed many things in the wiki article since it was a bit confusing. Besides, "seem" in English is mainly pronounced with a long vowel (often with a diphthong), so I changed the example with "sum", which has always a short and stable vowel.

==Glides versus semivowels==
Again, in the article there's a confusing usage of the symbols [j] [i&#774;] and [i] which should represent different [[phone]]s. We should use a standardized transcription system.

[[User:84.222.52.85|84.222.52.85]] 21:10, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

: Yes, the representations are really confusing. For example the diphthongs <ai> and <au> are /ai/ and /au/ under Portuguese but /aj/ and /aw/ under Romanian. Seems like <ai> and <au> are pronounced differently in these two languages, but that is hardly the case, right?
: -- [[fi:User:Rasulo|Rasulo]]

== Semivowels(=semiconsonants) in diphthongs ==
Not all phoneticians agree that semivowel+vowel combinations should be considered as diphthongs, e.g.: see [http://venus.unive.it/canipa/pdf/HPr_03_Italian.pdf Canepari] on Italian diphthongs.  According to this author, there are many fewer diphthongs in Italian than shown here, since semivowels are '''not''' proper vowels, so they can't be part of diphthongs.

Something about the different definitions of diphthong in use or having been used historically should be included here.

[[User:Freethinker77|FT77]] 00:46, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

::One thing to consider is rhyming.  In English, "yet" {{IPA|/jet/}} and "wet" {{IPA|/wet/}} have the semivowel+vowel combination and speakers will tell you that they rhyme.  However, in Spanish "diego" {{IPA|/djego/}} and "fuego" {{IPA|/fwego/}} do ''not'' rhyme (at least, according to the native speakers I've asked so far).

According to Mirriam Webster, the "pth" is an official secondary pronunciation.

==Definition of falling and rising diphthong==
From the article:

"'''Falling''' diphthongs start with a higher vowel, e.g., {{IPA|[i&#601;]}},  while '''rising''' diphthongs end with a higher vowel, e.g., {{IPA|[ai]}}. In '''closing''' diphthongs, the second element is [[vowel#vowel qualities|closer]] than the first;"

This is not the definition I'm familiar with. I thought that falling diphthongs were the ones with stress on the first vowel, and rising diphthongs were the ones with stress on the second vowel. See the [[Diphthong#Romanian|diphthongs of Romanian]], for example; in [e̯o] and [uj], the height of both vowels is the same. [[User:FilipeS|FilipeS]] 10:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:Stress is something that is applied to a whole syllable, not part of a diphthong.  I think I understand what you're talking about though, since one part of a diphthong is typically considered stronger and the other weaker.  You're going to need to provide a source for your definition, though, and also account for what "centering" diphthongs would then be.  Keep in mind, also, that the terms for diphthongs are completely arbitrary and Romanian just happens to be a language that doesn't really fit well into the system.  [[User:Aeusoes1|AEuSoes1]] 05:48, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

Let me explain what I mean with a couple of examples. In Portuguese, there are diphthongs like ''ui'' [ui ̯] and ''iu'' [iu̯] -- or [uj] and [iw]; the difference (if there is a difference) is not phonemic. These are called falling diphthongs in traditional grammar because they are composed of vowel + semivowel. Yet both [i] and [u] have the same height!
There are also rising diphthongs, composed of semivowel + vowel, for example ''uí'' [u̯i] and ''iú'' [i ̯u] (or [wi], [ju]). Again, in this case both elements of the diphthong have the same height. 
I understand that linguists may prefer more technical definitions than conventional grammars, but I don't see how the definition used in the article would account for these cases and differences... [[User:FilipeS|FilipeS]] 12:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

::Ahh, I found something that may explain some of what we're talking about [[http://home.nvg.org/~taliesin/conlang/diphthongs.html]].  For most of the article, the term ''rising'' has been applied to what this link describes as ''closing'' and ''falling'' for ''opening''.  It also includes a number of other terms.  I don't really have anything bound that contradicts it so I guess these are the definitions we can use unless somebody can back up my original definition (or another) with a non-web resource.  
::This puts to question the layoutof the article.  Why do we make distinctions between opening and closing diphthongs and not centering ones or fronting ones, etc?[[User:Aeusoes1|AEuSoes1]] 04:18, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

I've made the change in the definition. The factor influencing whether a diphthong is falling or rising is sonority. A falling d. has falling sonority (so the tongue slides from a lower vowel to a higher vowel, in terms of the vowel grid, because that is how sonority decreases within the class of vowels). A rising d. has a rising sonority profile.

Thank you. I've taken the liberty of rewriting the definition a little bit. [[User:FilipeS|FilipeS]] 21:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

This article should explain as I believe to be the case, the American removal and ignor-ance of the diphthong as the cause of the American mis-pronunciation of words like Paedophile, because they spell it Pedophile. Why say wikipeeedia, but not peeedophile?

:That has to do with language change in Latin and Greek before such words were ever borrowed, not ignorance.

== Pronunciation  of Diphthong ==

It seems to me there could be three (or even four) ways to pronounce this word:<br>
* Dip-thong
* Dif-thong
* Daif-thong
Obviously "dip thong" is the one that comes into your head when looking at the word, "diff thong" is the most likely pronunciation and "daif thong" is a pronunciation that stems from "di" (rhymes with pie) as in two (mono, di, tri). That would mean [[triphthong]] was pronounced traif-thong. Does anyone have any sources for which is correct (if any)?

I made a table to show a comparison of English dialects so we could see them side by side.  Perhaps, rather than sectioning off the languages and listing the diphthongs repeatedly we could have a table that has a list of common diphthongs, languages that have them (with examples) and then languages that have unusual or rare diphthongs can be discussed as well.

That probably has to do with the distinction between rising diphthongs (which many linguists seem to analyse as approximant + monophthong) and falling diphthongs (proper diphthongs). Many French diphthongs are of the rising kind. However, the article lists a few falling ones as well. [[User:FilipeS|FilipeS]]

== Dutch diphtongs ==

In standard Netherlands Dutch, /e/, /ø/ and /o/ are diphtongues as well, more like /ei/, /øy/ and /ou/ (see [[Dutch phonology]] page). I'll included them with a footnote, anyone disagree? EDIT: ok, done, tell me what you think. [[User:Jalwikip|Jalwikip]] 09:35, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

== Diphthongues of language X ==

I think we should create a 'diphthongues in different languages' page, to keep the linguistic stuff apart from the examples. Otherwise this page is going to grow and grow, the actual definition becoming only a very small part of it. Also, I think it would be nice to include diphthongue graphs for each language then, most are available from the respective phonology pages. [[User:Jalwikip|Jalwikip]] 09:37, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

== Diphthongs & Stress ==

I will refer to Spanish only as it is the language I know the most. This may be useful for anyone, though, and you may have better examples from other languages.
There's no information concerning the relationship between diphthongs and stress (and intonation), even though the latter can determine to some extent whether a diphthong rises or falls.
They only describe rising and falling diphthongs, and compare them with each other. Since they show some examples in the same paragraph, it might easily be (mis)understood that the rising or falling is inherent to those particular examples (they just happen to mention {{IPA|/aɪ̯/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ̯a/}} so it seems as though the {{IPA|/-ɪ̯// ɪ̯-/}} sound must always correspond to the vowel with less prominence). If you thought that this misunderstanding couldn’t arise just from this unintentional detail, please scroll down and pay attention to how the examples are displayed: 
'''Spanish'''
Diphthongs in Spanish:
'''rising'''
*	/ja/ as in comedia
*	/jo/ as in dio
...
It looks like those are the only possibilities for standard Spanish (and nothing else). Moreover, they unintentionally make it appear as if /ja/ could only be in the “rising” section and never in the “falling” section. In "comedia", the diphthong is unstressed so it's not easy to tell which vowel is more prominent (you can only tell that it opens). I think ''comediante'' is less ambiguous, but again this is because of the stress: ''co-'''me'''-dia'' {{IPA|[ko'mɛdja]}}; ''co-me-'''dian'''-te'' {{IPA|[komɛ'djantɛ]}}.
''Dio'' is alright, since the diphthong certainly rises but also consider other words such as ''predio''.
Please correct me if I’m wrong but I just pronounce ''comedia'' over and over and never get a clear ascending diphthong. 
We’re considering isolated words only. However, '''intonation''' should also be significant in more complex structures such as sentences.
For the time meaning, I’ll only replace the somewhat ambiguous examples.

:I'm not sure if I get what you're saying.  I am somewhat aware of glide formation at sentence boundaries in Spanish.  Martínez-Celdrán et al say that "In fast speech, sequences of vowels in hiatus reduce so that one becomes [–syllabic]. If both vowels have the same timbre they fuse." (p 256).  They also provide a sample:

{{IPA|[el ˈβjen̪to ˈnoɾte ʝ el ˈsol poɾˈfjaβan soβɾe ˈkwal̪ˈdeʎoˈs eɾa e̯l ˈmasˈfweɾte

:Is this what you're talking about?  If so, I'd say that the glide formation in this example exhibits ''phonetic'' diphthongs rather than phonemic ones.

In part, yes. I guess you're right and I should have provided that kind of examples to clarify. However, even if you pronounce words separately (as they are shown in the list of rising and falling Spanish diphthongs) you get some words where it's very difficult to tell whether the diphthong rises or falls (as I mentioned before, you could tell if they open or close more easily). That's why I think the falling-rising criterion is not always the best way to classify diphthongs. So my opinion was, if they are going to keep it as it is they should at least give some less ambiguous examples.--[[User:Quinceps|Quinceps]] 16:06, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

Sorry Aeusoes, would you care to explain how /j/ and /w/ are “inaccurate”, please? The sounds /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ do not exist in (standard at least) Portuguese.

Phonemically (with / slashes /) j and w are as accurate as any other transcription, and if Portuguese linguists use them for diphthongs then it does indeed seem very appropriate to use them.  — [[User:Aeusoes1|Æµ§œš¹]] <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[[User talk:aeusoes1|<small><sub>[aɪm ˈfɻɛ̃ⁿdˡi]</sub></small>]]</span>

== semivowels vs approximants ==

Since this article is cross-linguistic, I thought it important to be precise phonetically. To that end I've converted the entries from phonemic to phonetic transcription, and attempted to rigorously distinguish semivowel from approximant. Yes, I know that not all phoneticians make that distinction, and that even if they do, it is not important for many of these languages, but it *is* relevant when comparing languages. And many of the examples were written as hiatus, which is confusing if you don't know the language. I'm sure I made a few (ha!) misteaks. Latvian needs serious review—there were 52 diphthongs, when the Latvian article says 6! Also, I don't what to do with some of the odder Germanic diphthongs. When there is a length mark at the end, is that for the final component, or for the diphthong as a whole? We need to add the semivowel diacritic and perhaps move the length diacritics. [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 22:04, 3 June 2008 (UTC)

: Or one could simply state at the introduction of the article that the diacritic for semivowel is omitted, and that all vowel-vowel combinations are to be read as diphthongs, not as constructs with hiatus. Of course this does not specify yet whether the forst of the second vowel is the unstressed/semivowel constituent, but that could be addressed on a per language basis.

Here it is [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134.8785&rep=rep1&type=pdf], this document in English from the University of California, Berkeley, says that they are palatal approximants and labiovelar approximants, in the section "Diphthongs (and triphthongs)" page 7.
<blockquote>

Utilizing the palatal approximant [j] and the labio-velar approximant [w], any stressed vowel

may form a rising or falling diphthong [7] with the exception of [ij ji] or [uw wu]. It is thus

possible to produce twenty-four distinct diphthongs, and a few triphthongs. The diphthongs

are illustrated in Table 1. (Many of these examples are from [7].)

== Italian "potrei" ==

In the Italian diphthongs table the value [ei] is given for the second entry "potrei". That's wrong, "potrei" actually sounds [potrɛi] and the diphthong found in it is just like the one of following "sei". Source: I'm a native speaker.
It would surprise me to learn that this kind of error was copied from that Italian textbook cited as reference for the table, apparently published by two Italians. Anyway, if you want an example of [ei] - which is gonna be very rare as a diphthong in Italian, being [ɛi] the form one finds almost everywhere - I think you could use "teina" [teina] (the substance found in tea). It carries the accent on "i", but "-ei-" sounds like a diphthong to me and not a hiatus.
Also, maybe "sei" should be disambuigated. "Sei" is the number 6, but also the very frequent verb form for "you are".  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/79.53.130.251|79.53.130.251]] ([[User talk:79.53.130.251|talk]]) 11:52, 6 March 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Standard English diphthongs table ==

According to the table in the article entitled "Standard English diphthongs", the General American pronunciation of a word like "lean" is the same as the Australian pronunciation of said word.  I strongly disagree with this assertion.  To me, the pronunciation of "lean" and other words with that vowel is one of the most noticeable differences between the two accents.  I see that there are some sources cited at the bottom of the article, but I can't figure out which one of them that claim comes from.  

From a systemic perspective, I can see how the vowel in "lean" could be {{IPA|[ɪi̯]}} in Australian English, as the vowel in "lane" in that accent is {{IPA|[æɪ̯]}}.  But it doesn't seem possible in Gen Am, where the the onset of {{IPA|/eɪ/}} is still close-mid.  Such a distinction would surely be too difficult to maintain.  I also disagree that the vowel of "loon" is {{IPA|[ʊu]}} in Gen Am.  This would surely be too close to the {{IPA|[ou]}} of "loan".

Well, the Broad vowel ''clearly'' has way more movement than the GA vowel.  I don't think anyone would disagree with that.  That's why I figured you meant Cultivated there.

== Latin dipthongs ==

I'm sorry, but why aren't [http://wheelockslatin.com/chapters/introduction/introduction_diphthongs.html Latin diphthongs] ae, au, ei, eu, oe, ui listed?

== Phonemic and phonetic ==

The article needs more information on what distinguishes a phonetic from a phonemic diphthong. In some cases diphthongs are phonemic because they develop from monophthongs by [[vowel shift]], like English ''house'' and German ''Haus'' from earlier ''hūs''. Some diphthongs are clearly not phonemic based on this criterion, like Italian ''piu'' from Latin ''plus'' and Spanish ''muy'' from Latin ''multum'', but some cases of phonemic diphthongs also don't fulfill the criterion, like German ''Frau'' from [[Middle High German]] ''vrouwe''. I suppose this is because the last example is merged with the diphthongs-from-monophthongs as in the first example, and thus takes their phonemic nature onto itself. But a source on this subject should be found and its reasoning added to the article.

The Spanish section says that Spanish has 15 total ''phonemic'' diphthongs; I believe this is incorrect and will change it to ''phonetic'', but I don't have access to the sources to verify that I'm right. — [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]·[[User_talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 21:29, 18 January 2015 (UTC)

: How do you understand ‘phonemic’?  The status of a phoneme does not depend on history.  The fifteen diphthongs listed are phonemic because they are regularly distinctive from each other and from the same vowels in hiatus.  The passage contrasts these with the ''oe'' of ''poeta'' in rapid speech, a phonetic phenomenon that, apparently, has not achieved phonemic status. —[[User:Tamfang|Tamfang]] ([[User talk:Tamfang|talk]]) 05:44, 8 May 2016 (UTC)

== Merge with monophthong, split into list article ==

The article [[monophthong]] is currently stub-size, since I moved the discussion of Monophthongization to another article. It could therefore be merged with this article. If so, this article would have to be moved to [[Diphthong and monophthong]], similar to [[Endocentric and exocentric]], and other article names that I can't recall. This would require a lot of link-fixing, but that can easily be done with AutoWikiBrowser.

Also, the list of languages is too long. Most languages should be moved to a separate article, which could be titled [[List of diphthongs]], while more notable languages, like English, German, French, Spanish, and Mandarin could be kept here.

What do others think? — [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]·[[User_talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 22:13, 19 February 2015 (UTC)

On second thought, we could replace the lists of diphthongs with a brief discussion of which languages in which families have diphthongs, how many, and what type. For instance, Romance languages have a lot, and Mainland Southeast Asian languages frequently have rising diphthongs, hence the syllable analyis of initial, medial, nucleus, and final. Romanian has unusual diphthongs, and so do Finnish and Estonian. Typological highlights, basically. — [[User:Erutuon|Eru]]·[[User_talk:Erutuon|tuon]] 22:18, 19 February 2015 (UTC)

:I tend to agree with all of this. Whenever we have two opposed concepts like these, it generally seems to work best to combine them into one article. (Of course there are also triphthongs and tetraphthongs, but those can be mentioned in passing.) I wouldn't even bother with a comprehensive list of diphthongs - it's unlikely ever to be truly comprehensive, and the main place to go for information about individual languages' phonologies should be those languages' own articles.

<small>(I'm not used to using [ ], I'm used to / /. I'm getting off that habit)</small>

I believe it is a close-front vowel as opposed to near-close-front vowel.
Let's take two diphthongs as an example: [aɪ] and [eɪ].

In [aɪ], you get a much more similar sound pronouncing it [a.i]

And it isn't a near-close, you can feel that one.
