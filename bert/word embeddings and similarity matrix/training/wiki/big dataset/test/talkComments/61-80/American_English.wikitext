:I am a different idiot, not the person who contributed the word "pavement". I have not had so much direct contact with the British, but this is a usage difference I have often noted in comparing American English with Hong Kong English. In America, the word may refer to any hard paved surface, but usually indicates a paved street for motor vehicles. In Hong Kong, I have seen the word applied only in reference to a sidewalk. The Hong Kong primary school books have all kinds of advice that would not play well in America. E.g., "We should always walk on the pavement." That one is a distant second to my favorite, "We can wash our hands in the public toilet." [[User:Geometricks|Geometricks]] ([[User talk:Geometricks|talk]]) 06:03, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

To start name calling i.e. Idiot, lowers the standard of Wikipedia and is not necessary to make a point. However the word “Pavement” is used 99% of the time to describe a walkway at the side of the road in the UK.
--[[User:Raytelford|Raytelford]] ([[User talk:Raytelford|talk]]) 13:14, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

Not actually accurate.  'Pavement' is used in both American English (AE) and British English (BE).  The confusion probably arises because they mean different things.  As noted: in BE, the 'pavement' is what in AE is called the 'sidewalk'.  In AE, the 'pavement' is what in BE is called the 'road'.

==/ɹɪzum/ ?==

I'm a native speaker of American English, and I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone pronounce "resume" with the final "e" silent, as indicated in the "dropping of /j/" portion of the Phonology section.  Unless some very substantial citations to the contrary can be produced, I think this should be changed.

:The pronunciation indicated in the article (re-ZOOM) is that of the verb "to resume" – you seem to be thinking of the noun "resumé" (sometimes spelled without the accent) as in "job application/curriculum vitae", which is RE-zoo-may and does indeed not have a silent e.

==Different from and plural after collective nouns==
I have removed the reference to 'different from', as it was incorrect in suggesting that this is not used in British English. It is in fact the standard form there. I have also weakened the reference to 'the team are...', etc., as this usage is not universal in British English. (In fact the singular is used when the group is seen as one unit, e.g. 'The government is unpopular', but plural when seen as a group of individuals, e.g. 'The government are discussing a reform'). [[User:Pawebster|APW]] ([[User talk:Pawebster|talk]]) 08:14, 31 October 2010 (UTC)

:There clearly is a difference between UK and US uses, in regards to "the team are...", since as an American I would consider "the government" to be one unit no matter what the context (although of course in a sentence like "the government is discussing a reform," it's understood that the government is comprised of individuals). Interestingly, without even thinking about it, we shift from the singular to the plural at times, for example: "Nirvana IS my favorite band. They ARE one of the best bands of the '90s" (we wouldn't say "It IS one of the best bands of the '90s").[[User:Commonparlance|Commonparlance]] ([[User talk:Commonparlance|talk]]) 17:47, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

== numerous European languages ==

The introduction of the article has a paragraph with the sentence

:"The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America in the 17th century. During [the 17th century], there were also speakers of numerous Native American languages, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Norwegian, Swedish, Scots, Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Finnish, Russian (in Alaska), and numerous African languages (mostly from the western coast of Africa)."

I'm trying to concoct a justification wherein this enumeration of languages isn't horribly Eurocentric. I mean, if we picked out just Spanish, French, Dutch, and German for special mention, I could agree that those languages have special roles in the linguistic developments of at least some regions of North America. But we went out of our way to exhaustively list all the European languages spoken in North America in the 17th century, no matter how small the immigrant community nor how little its impact on North American linguistic history. I mean Finnish? Russian? Scots? How are those more noteworthy or relevant than, say, Wolof? Or Navajo?

Obviously we can't list every language spoken in North America in the 17th century. They probably number in the thousands. So what's our plan? List every single European language, no matter how minor, and not a single Native American or African language? 

I propose the sentence be changed to one of these alternatives:
:"there were also speakers of numerous Native American languages, numerous European languages, and numerous western African languages, among other."

or else

:"there were also speakers of numerous Native American languages, including Navajo, Algonquian, Cherokee, Nahuatl, Sioux; numerous European languages, including Spanish, French, Dutch, and German; and numerous western African languages, including Wolof, Mandinka, and Yoruba."

I am open to alternative proposals for determining criteria for listing other languages. But I would ask that these criteria be applied equally to non-European languages.

Alternatively, we could lose the paragraph altogether. I'm not sure how much value it adds to the article.

== Gotten ==

The article claims that:

Gotten (past participle of get) is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and North-eastern England, that still continue to use it.

I am certain that is wrong. I don't know about North-eastern England, but I was born, educated and have worked, lived and travelled in Lancashire for almost 50 years without seeing or hearing "gotten" used by any of its residents - including a wide variety of dialect speakers and writers.

:: I was born just outside of Manchester and have heard both gotten and putten before. It's not something I'd expect to hear from someone talking in a formal context... or dare I say it, "educated".

I live in Manchester too. I have relatives just up the road in Westhoughton Lancashire. They don't exactly say "gotten" but they do say "gitten" or "getten" which is pretty near. The accent is very un-American of course. (Is un-American a word? If not, apologies.) [[User:Fletcherbrian|Fletcherbrian]] ([[User talk:Fletcherbrian|talk]]) 12:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

== 'soccer' is alive in Britain ==

The article claims 'The term "soccer," the term normally used for association football in the United States, originated in Britain, but died out there.'

No, 'soccer' is still current in Britain; for instance if both rugby and association football are played at a school, they may be distinguished as 'rugby' (or 'rugger') and 'soccer' respectively. In Britain 'football' means soccer unless the context implies otherwise (in the minutes of a Rugby Union committee meeting, say); so normally it's not necessary to use 'soccer'. In the US, 'football' means grid-iron, so 'soccer' has to be used.

Since 
* a Google search for 'soccer site:.uk' shows examples of current usage, and
* the statement is itself not supported by a citation, and
* the main article [[Comparison of American and British English]] contains a more accurate discussion of 'soccer', and additionally
* the statement is irrelevant to the paragraph that it ends,
the statement should be removed.

== American Variety, American Accent or American Dialect?   ==

Is American English merely a variety of English, an accent, or a dialect?  Is the syntax, pronunciation, gammar and vocabulary of American English significantly different enough to warrent the term 'dialect'?  In comparison, I point to the dialects of other language groups, such as the dialects German (Upper Bavarian, Saxon, Low German Platt, etc.), Italian (Venetian, Sicilian, Calabrese, etc.).  The syntax, vocabulary and grammar differences within these dialects are quite high and often so complex that mutual intelligibility can be either difficult or impossible, whereas the minor differences between spoken or written American- and British English are rather small, and are more a matter of accent than dialect.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Markkaempfer|Markkaempfer]] ([[User talk:Markkaempfer|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markkaempfer|contribs]]) 23:32, 2 February 2013 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:I'd say American English is a dialect of English, while Upper Bavarian, Saxon, Low German Platt, Venetian, Sicilian, Calabrese, etc., are separate languages, not dialects of German and Italian. [[User:Angr|Angr]] ([[User talk:Angr|talk]]) 09:16, 3 April 2013 (UTC)

I disagree.  Saxon is not a language, but a variety of Middle German. I speak Saxon (the version spoken between Leipzig/Altenburg), and it is a version of Middle German.  When Saxony was an independent duchy, its version of German - the version spoken in Dresden - held a specific status in the court and government of Saxony.  Once Saxony was incorporated into the German Empire, Saxon was reduced to the status of regional dialect.  Standard High German became the official German across the empire and Saxony.

I would agree that Low German Platt is a language family with its own dialects. Upper Bavarian is a member of the High German language family, and is a dialect within that family.   
[Special:Contributions/Markkaempfer|contribs]])

== Language or dialect? ==

Surely American English is a dialect of English, not a separate language.  Therefore rather than saying "American English is a language used mostly in the United States", shouldn't the introduction say "American English is the dialect of English spoken by the majority of English speakers in the United States".[[Special:Contributions/203.184.41.226|203.184.41.226]] ([[User talk:203.184.41.226|talk]]) 05:50, 1 April 2013 (UTC)
:I've undone the edit that changed the article to say American English is a language.  — [[User:Aeusoes1|Æµ§œš¹]] <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[[User talk:aeusoes1|<small><sub>[ãːɱ ˈfɹ̠ˤʷɪ̃ə̃nlɪ]</sub></small>]]</span> 15:59, 3 April 2013 (UTC)

Dialects and languages usually have profound differences, such as syntax, grammar, etc.  There is never one dialect within a language family that is 'correct'.  Rather, a particular dialect - often the version spoken near the capital city - becomes the standard dialect of a language group, and thus becomes a 'language', while all the other versions of that language are called 'dialects.  Therefore, the difference between dialect and language is often a matter of politics, and there isn't really any criteria to determine when you have a dialect or language.  For example, is Limburgs a dialect of Dutch?  If Limburg gained independence from Holland with a government in support of the local vernacular, would you then have a language or a dialect?  It would probably be called a language because it would have the support of a national government.  

However, the differences between American English and British English are so minor, that you would have a difficult time arguing that American English is a dialect.  There are hardly any differences in syntax or grammar between the two.  The minor spelling differences and the very limited differences in vocabulary are often found within many other world languages without those languages being called dialects.  So why do that with American English and British English??  The biggest difference between American English and British English, or Brooklyn English and Chicago English, is a matter of pronunciation and accent.  I would not call 'accents' and different 'pronunciation styles' dialects.

==Merge proposal==
{{archive top|I was asked to close this discussion as a neutral editor.  It appears to me that there is rough consensus to merge this to [[North American English regional phonology]], with redirect.

*I '''support''' the merger suggestion. At a glance, [[American Accent]] seems problematic. It terms of content, it overlaps [[English language]] (word order, for example, does not vary among major dialect areas), [[North American English regional phonology‎]], [[North American English]], [[Canadian English]], and [[American English]].

* I '''Oppose'''. Hello, thank you for your proposal for merging the article [[American Accent]] with [[American English]]. American Accent is a part of American English but it is a totally different thing. As we all know that it is the way of talking and pronouncing, I think a different Article is necessary as a result of letting people know more elaborately about American Accent. So that people can talk and speak more fluently using American English. Because of the fact that people of other countries, who are not Native Speaker of American English try to follow American English in their day to day life for its simplicity. And American Accent is essential for the purpose of speaking and communicating with others. It is easier for the people to directly search for American Accent and have more knowledge about the Accent part only. More information will be added into this Article with the passage of time and if there is any mistake, then it will be edited. After your merging proposal was made, I have talked with few specialists of American Accent and they have also agreed that a different article is quite helpful and they have agreed to provide information and correction for making the article more appropriate and accurate. The rest is up to you. I hope you are understanding the point of view. You can help me in correcting things if you think are inappropriate in the Article. Will look forward to working together.

== artikle two hard to grok rite now ==

I assert this article is overly technical, and is written for linguists in academia, when in fact there are plenty of everyday adults (not to mention some poor fourth-grader trying to do their homework) that find the current article unbelievably stuffy and jargon-filled.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_English&diff=next&oldid=579286657]  

There is *already* a separate [[Phonology of English]] article, which covers *all* the morphology and phonology stuff in excruciating detail.  I prefer that article, for my own use-case, but why is all that stuff duplicated here, in this article?  The MOST important thing, the very first subsection, in phonology?  What about calling the first section "general similarities among dialects" and calling the section section "regional differences".  There can also be a section which gives historical context, and modern linguistic contrasts (uk vs us / us vs india / etc) as well as modern demographic contrasts (number of speakers of this flavor of english compared to number of speaker of the main flavor of chinese and french and spanish and so on).  

Anything that is overly technical, should be summarized in layman's terms here, then moved to the phonology/morphology/etc articles designed for specialists in those fields.  We can *link* to the tech stuff, but *this* article should be aimed squarely at a general readership.  Right now it is too dern high-falutin'!  :-)  &nbsp;&nbsp; Which is ha-ha, only serious.

It's easy enough to find counter-examples: [http://grammar.about.com/od/ab/g/American-English.htm] (Norquist notes that the narrow definition is more common, but then, there are more native English speakers in the US than in any other country, so that just reflects the current bias), [http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Think_in_English/Canada.html] ("learn American English" with a Canadian flag), [http://www.hello-world.com/translation/songs.php/?activity=oh-canada&language=English&translate=Russian] ("Oh Canada" in "American English"), etc.

*'''Oppose''' per COMMONNAME. I'm faintly sympathetic to the argument, but [[WP:BIAS]]-hunting can easily wander into [[WP:GREATWRONGS]] territory. US English really is called American English in the preponderance of sources. That this coincidentally aligns with an inherent bias, in that most material written about AmEng is written in AmEng, and comes from an American publisher is irrelevant. There are a very large number of articles that should be moved, if "what's most accurate or proper" could trump COMMONNAME, but so it goes.  Note that we already have a [[North American English]] article. All that's needed is a disambiguating hatnote.  You're free to refer to American English as [[US English]] if you prefer (or, to turn the logic on its head, call it [[U.S. English]], using an punctuational Americanism the rest of the world ignores, and that WP should ignore much more often, especially in all articles not written in AmEng, for starters).  Anyway, the proposed name isn't grammatically accurate. "English in the United States" is English spoken by anyone who happens to be in the US.  We actually could write an article about that, e.g. on the demographics of speakers of British, Barbadian, etc., English in the US.

== "two-thirds of the world's native speakers of English" ==

There are around 400 million native speakers of English and only (according to this article) 225 million native speakers in the US. [[User:Rob984|Rob984]] ([[User talk:Rob984|talk]]) 17:35, 21 August 2015 (UTC)

== /æ/-tensing before /r/ ? ==

The /æ/-tensing table is pretty good, but I think there's something that's not completely accurate.  

There is really no tense-lax opposition before /r/, because North American dialects typically do not allow /æ/ to be followed by /r/ in the first place. In accents with the marry-merry-mary merger, the /æ/ in the historical sequence /æ.r/ is not tensed, but rather the sequence as a whole is replaced by /er/ (which is probably best regarded as a single phoneme), so that ''marry'' /mæ.ri/ becomes /mer.i/ (same as ''Mary''). 

The table in its current form may suggest that e.g. in the Northern Cities accents the stressed vowels of ''marry'' and ''harrowing'' sound the way they sound due to the wholesale tensing and raising of /æ/, which would be incorrect, since /æ/-tensing and the phonetic value of /æ/ before /r/ are unrelated no matter the accent.

Accents that have not undergone the Mery-marry-merry merger do allow /æ/ to be followed by /r/, in which case /æ/ retains its default value [æ]. [[User:Stick Daze|Stick Daze]] ([[User talk:Stick Daze|talk]]) 22:18, 14 September 2015 (UTC)

:{{replyto|Stick Daze}} Alright.  [[User:AJD|AJD]] and I have concluded that prerhotic vowels <em>do</em> function as a separate super–class <em>per se</em>.  However, I think you may be slightly confused.  For one, the "ar" in <em>Mary</em> is typically pronounced closer to [eər] than [er].  (Vowel-breaking of prerhotic front vowels is common.  Examples include [iər] in <em>deer</em>, and [aɪər] in <em>fire</em>.)

:Also, you seem to have an old idea that I have had for years, that /æ/ is allowed to come before /r/.  Therefore, I can assume that you, like me, at least have the <em>Mary</em>–<em>marry</em> merger.  However, it is probably safest not to make that assumption.  For one, the merger is relatively young.  But more importantly, as the two were initially distinct, it is <em>safer</em> to say that, while /æ/ <em>is</em> permitted before /r/, most dialects shift /ær/ to /eər/.  Although I thought differently at first, I think I now can see where you're coming from.[[User:LakeKayak|LakeKayak]] ([[User talk:LakeKayak|talk]]) 01:28, 2 January 2017 (UTC)
::The actual phonetic values of the r-colored vowels and diphthongs are a matter of some debate.  Personally, the transcriptions I prefer use the rhotacized schwa {{IPA|<ɚ>}} ({{IPA|[eɚ]}} for SQUARE, {{IPA|[iɚ]}} for NEAR and so on), as I believe that the articulations of the schwa and the following r are simultaneous rather than sequential. However, such transcriptions are not entirely satisfactory when a rhotacized schwa is followed by a vowel. Compare ''prayer'' and ''prairie'', ''leer'' and ''leery'', ''were'' and ''worry''. The {{IPA|[ɚ]}} seems to function as a semivowel, not unlike the second elements of the PRICE, MOUTH, and FACE diphthongs (compare ''buy'' and ''buyer'', ''play'' and ''playing'', and so on) and is probably better transcribed as {{IPA|[r]}}. Still, this kind of {{IPA|[r]}} is not quite the same as an {{IPA|/r/}} preceding a stressed vowel; for instance, the first ''r'' in ''rare'' is different from both the second ''r'' in ''rare'' and the second ''r'' in ''rarity''.  I have the impression that this issue is often overlooked, although it's discussed at length in Kenyon's ''American Pronunciation: A Textbook of Phonetics for Students of English''--a dated source, but a captivating read nevertheless. Also, the jury is still out on the actual phonetic values of the first elements of SQUARE and NEAR. For speakers merging marry-merry-Mary and mirror-nearer, they are probably somewhere between {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, and {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, respectively, although closer to the higher sound in both cases.  (But those diphthongs sound decidedly more open in the speech of older people.)  It's a can of worms, but one that is worth opening in my opinion. [[User:Stick Daze|Stick Daze]] ([[User talk:Stick Daze|talk]]) 20:03, 2 April 2017 (UTC)

:{{replyto|Stick Daze}} It has been about three months.  And after thinking about this for some time, I think that I myself may pronounce marry–Mary, merry, and mirror–nearer with pure vowels after all.  I do agree that the first "r" in "rare" is different from the second "r" even though the two are allophonic.  As for what the difference is, the initial "r" is typically rounded, potentially realized as {{IPA|[ɹʷ]}}.[[User:LakeKayak|LakeKayak]] ([[User talk:LakeKayak|talk]]) 00:35, 3 April 2017 (UTC)

:"From-rum merger" is not a real term, and definitely not a merger, but it seems to be someone trying to point out that function words such as ''of'' and ''from'' have /ʌ/ in American English (whereas in British English they have /ɒ/). This is true, as far as I know, but I'm not sure that whole entry isn't OR. [[User:Ajd|AJD]] ([[User talk:Ajd|talk]]) 04:32, 17 January 2017 (UTC)

:Why not go into the brief details of the dialect than a sort of history of it that it used to be some standard 60+ years ago? I'll agree that this detail belongs on the main inland north page (which is where it is stated.) I don't see my changes as changing much.

{{replyto|Zero077}} Well, first, I am open to the section "describing the details of the dialect history", but I don't know enough about the Inland North to make the claim myself.  But also, on either this page or [[North American regional phonology]], I believe it is also mentioned that Philadelphia has steered away from its initial Midland pattern.
The former content of this page did not say Inland North was a standard 60+ years ago.  It said that Northern American English was used as the foundation for General American when it was being developed 60+ years ago, but the Inland North has steered away from this pattern.[[User:LakeKayak|LakeKayak]] ([[User talk:LakeKayak|talk]]) 00:07, 30 April 2017 (UTC)

:"General American" meets every criterion of [[WP:GNG]]: it "has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject", so it certainly is well-known and widely discussed. Moreover, it's helpful as a baseline or reference point (and comparative linguists like [[John C. Wells]] seem to think so). General American is the ''real'' set of accents that most Americans perceive of as sounding [[markedness|unmarked]]. Just because it's based on perception doesn't mean there aren't very definite sounds that are GenAm or not. A majority of Americans say ''bird'' as [bəɹd] and also do not bat an eye at the sound of [bəɹd]. Therefore, the phoneme {{IPAc-en|ɝ}} in that word is typically [əɹ] in both production and perception throughout the U.S., and so is certainly a GenAm sound.

:{{ping|MrBadger42}} I don't quite understand your argument. You repeatedly frame it as: General American should not be presented as a "regional dialect". But no one is claiming that or presenting it that way. No one is saying GenAm is ''regional''. We're simply using a general, typical, average American accent as a point of basic reference -- no matter what you want to call it. For example, [ə] is indisputably a completely typical American pronunciation of the first vowel in ''about'': a pronunciation heard regardless of where you are in the U.S. The same thing with [äɪ] for the vowel in ''mind''. 
:Your Atlas Obscura article talks about how General American is more a matter of perception that strict patterns. In fact, the article claims, "''All accents'' are semi-consistent groups of sounds" (my italics). I think we all agree with both statements. That doesn't mean there is no General American "umbrella" or "spectrum". What Labov is saying in that YouTube clip is there is no one single regional accent that could be identified as General American. That's his point, and probably the point of other linguists, who so often encounter laypersons who mistakenly believe GenAm is a regional dialect that is uniform and singular. We're not claiming that. All we're doing is giving some average or typical sounds of American English: what for decades has been called "General American" (again, for convenience, not for exactness).
:As a side note, Jim Lehrer does not even have what Labov considers the defining feature of the Southern accent: {{sc|price}} glide deletion. However, he certainly has other Southern accent traces. The sources also raise the question about prominent people in the media trying to "lose" their accents. We intelligent people of course realize that ''everyone'' has an accent, so you can't actually "lose" one, unless you simultaneous "gain" another. (They don't just refuse to pronounce certain vowels, for instance; they pronounce them differently than before.) Therefore, without meaning to, these sources raise the question: What accent do Lehrer, Colbert, and others ''gain'' or ''strive for'' when they "lose" their original accents? I think the answer is obvious: an accent fitting more closely along a General American spectrum. Instead of saying ''mind'' with a Southern [aː], for example, Lehrer pronounces it with the more average-American [äɪ]. See our point now?

== Mobile version of the article problematic ==

There is a problem in the mobile version of this article where the other sections are hidden after hiding the "Varieties" section (Only the "Varieties" section appear. The "See also", "References", and "External Links" are all hidden under the Varieties section, though they are considered sections, per the existing wiki code). I tried to fix those, but, the "Varieties" section still appear as the only section in the article when on mobile. Is this a bug on the mobile version, or a problem with the wiki coding, that the other main sections have become subsections of the "Varieties" section?

== Western New England ==

A user just added a new subsection "Western New England" under the section "Varieties". Obviously, like any area of the country, Western New England has (several) varieties of English, but the features aren't really remarkable enough for this overview, so I just merged it and Eastern New England into a new subsection named "New England". The originating editor didn't like my compromise approach and reverted. What are people's thoughts? Does Western New England really merit its own separate subsection on this page? [[User:Wolfdog|Wolfdog]] ([[User talk:Wolfdog|talk]]) 00:38, 15 November 2017 (UTC)
:Hello, Wofldog. I added a source to the content I added, which is what I should of done before. ANAE list WNE under a different umbrella than ENE. So yes, I think it should be separated. [[User:Blastprocessor|Blastprocessor]] ([[User talk:Blastprocessor|talk]]) 01:53, 15 November 2017 (UTC)
::Hi, {{u|Blastprocessor}}. I appreciate your good-faith intentions, but my understanding is this Varieties section lists a few of the most salient varieties only, otherwise the list could go on forever (every metropolitan area could theoretically have its own variety listed). The Labov source that you added breaks varieties down in many ways (including defining Providence, Baltimore, and St. Louis varieties, for example), and yet no one is pushing to have a separate Providence or Baltimore variety listed here in this quick outline. We could also create a Southwest category based on the research in Labov's 300-page book. But this isn't justified by the scope here either. If anything, Western New England should fall under a simple "New England" category or be deleted. Can you name any ways that Western New England is unique enough to fit this broad list? R-fulness is rampant throughout the U.S. and the vowel shift that defines another area is sporadic at best in WNE. [[User:Wolfdog|Wolfdog]] ([[User talk:Wolfdog|talk]]) 20:58, 16 November 2017 (UTC)
:::Hi. ANAE does state in the source that WNE is defined by a moderate advanced form of the shift, so I don't see why we shouldn't include that.

:::::Hello {{replyto|Wolfdog}} ANAE separates them. I don't see why they can't be separated on this page. It makes no sense to merge them since they are categorized as separate in ANAE. I'll give an different example. New York has different dialects. New York City English falls under a separate category than that of Rochester, New York.

::::::{{replyto|Blastprocessor}} I'm not sure how long we can keep talking in circles. 
::::::*My original argument is that Western New England is unremarkable and so doesn't earn a place in this broad list of varieties. 
::::::*Then you argue that the ANAE discusses it. 
::::::*Next I say that, yes, the ANAE talks about all kinds of "separate" varieties we aren't adding to the list, because it's a broad or general list with only the most remarkable varieties. 
::::::*Then you argue that the ANAE discusses it. 
::::::*I then say why don't we compromise and just put it under New England (the more I think about it, though, "Inland North" might be a more appropriate category). 
::::::*Then you argue that the ANAE discusses it. 
::::::This is frustrating. I'm tempted to return to my original arguments again, but I'd also like to end this cycle of getting nowhere. I feel like I'm not being heard. Here's my last try: The ANAE is a gigantic nationwide study that also considers these as separate varieties: Boston, Providence, St. Louis Corridor, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Charleston, Southeast, New Orleans, Atlanta, Savannah, and potentially countless others. But no one wants all these to be separately listed here on a page whose scope is too broad for such details. Furthermore, you can't argue that Western New England is remarkable beyond details anyway. There's a "moderate" (in fact, "sporadic") form of a vowel shift in ''some speakers'' and there's rhoticity, which is also a steady feature of the South, the Midland, the Inland North and North Central, the West, and General American: i.e., the vast majority of American English speakers. The bottom line is you don't present convincing arguments. [[User:Wolfdog|Wolfdog]] ([[User talk:Wolfdog|talk]]) 02:42, 28 November 2017 (UTC)

== Collapsing down the "Varieties" sections ==

I had an idea to collapse the Eastern New England, New York City, South, North, Midland, West sections all down into one "Regional varieties" section. There's not a lot to say about some of these, particularly the North, Midland, and West (especially not for lay readers to really get -- I can keep the links to each dialect's own page of course), and there seems to currently be a decent amount of fluff. Are there any objections to this that I'm missing? [[User:Wolfdog|Wolfdog]] ([[User talk:Wolfdog|talk]]) 14:45, 19 January 2019 (UTC)

== Named for & named after ==

It's usually said that in American English, if a person, place or thing has been named in honour of another human being, they have been ''named for'' that person; and in British English, ''named after''.
 
Although, in fact, the two usages were originally distinct: if a person or thing takes its name in imitation of another person or thing, it is so named ''subsequently'' and in homage thereto (named after). 

But if a child is christened with the name of an elder relative, especially if that relative is now deceased, the child has been ''named for'' that relative (as a memorial to them).

==Spelling reform==

Having personally lost a city wide spelling bee over plough/plow (my elementary school used an Australian grammar series, American grammar books having already gone to hell) I still hold a grudge against Noah Webster.  And its not anecdotal.  Is there a page yet for spelling reform?  There are certainly lots of 'em.  This entry is going to shift to more substantive issues (17th century English as the base for American dialects, etc.) when a dialectician gets ahold of it, but I'm not up to that. --MichaelTinkler

::The way ''OK'' was included was a little odd, I agree, but ''OK'' originated in the United States, and furthermore, its origin is well known and has been since approximately 1965.  But I don't like working on articles with tables in them and usually avoid them, so it is up to someone else to fix this.  (If I worked on the article, the tables would go.) The story on ''OK'' is, briefly, that there was a [[word game]] popular in the United States in the early [[19th century]] of misspelling phrases and using only the initials -- not unlike the transformations of [[Cockney rhyming slang]] -- in which "O.K." stood for "oll korrect".  This origin was obscured by the subsequent combination of the phrase with the nickname of [[Martin Van Buren]] in the campaign slogan "Old Kinderhook is O.K." and the proliferation of many, many a [[folk etymology]] in later years.  The research by A. W. Read tracing the origin as stated here is accepted by both the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and ''Webster's III''.  ''OK'' is, perhaps, the best known of all Americanisms and certainly belongs in the article on [[American English]] as well as in an article of its own, which I have just half written.  (Why the "Ask Oxford" article is less positive on this is a mystery since their own, more authoritative ''OED'' presents it, but "Ask Oxford" is a good source for all the folk etymologies.)

I think it should be noted that not all of the loanwords are common in all parts of the United States. In my section of the Midwest at least many of these borrowings, especially the Yiddish ones and Spanish ones not dealing with food, have not yet become standard vocabulary.
----
A couple of the loanwords currently listed are, in my opinion, placed under the wrong headings. "Gumbo" is ultimately of African origin, but it entered English via Louisiana French. The same goes for "bayou" -- it comes from Louisiana French, which took it from Choctaw. In short, if English gets a word from French, it should be irrelevant where the French got it from. After all, we're not listing "adobe" as an Arabic loanword. [[User:BrianSmithson|BrianSmithson]] 19:54 20 May 2003 (UTC)

I think all of these may have been used in American English first---especially words taken from Spanish and Native American languages for obvious reasons.  Britons havent had the exposure to Spanish that Americans have had for a substantially longer period of time.

==Webster POV==

This page seems a bit disparaging of Webster, perhaps written from the perspective of someone who doesn't like his spelling reforms.  The article should be more neutral about Webster, perhaps mentioning that Webster did simplify the spelling of many words in American English and a good number of those reforms have stuck.

==American English an oxymoron?==
Why is "American English" supposed to be an [[oxymoron]] --- or at least more so than, say, ''Australian English'', ''Latin American Spanish'' or ''Quebecois French?''  Perhaps a better word for '''American English''' would be ''majority English''.  After all, most English speakers worldwide speak and write a variety from North America.  This comment strikes me as non-NPOV, and an attempt to portray some social-class-bound ''insular'' dialect as normative, an attitude which ever has been and remains a jaw-dropping pretension.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] 11:47 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)

: Most? Since when?

::Population of the USA: around 280 millions.  Canada adds 85% of 31 millions.  Population of the UK is 58 millions, add 19 millions for Australia, 8m for New Zealand and maybe 4m for the native English speaking population of South Africa.  No matter how you slice the pie, the center of gravity for the English language is in North America and not in any of the outlying islands.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] 13:40 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)

In [[India]] English is the language in which most university courses are taught. It is also the language used in most areas of administration, and they have many English language newspapers. Out of a total population of 1 billion potential speakers, some 40 million plus Indians speak British English there. The situation is similar in countries like Pakistan, Ghana, Nigeria and Singapore etc. etc. When English is taught as a foreign language in Europe and elsewhere it is very often taught as British English through organizations like the [[British Council]].

:When I was in Sweden in the mid-1970s, the saying there was that people over 35 had learned British English in school, and that people under 30 learned American English.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] 15:10 25 Jul 2003 (UTC)

[[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] is correct, at least regarding number of speakers.  There are 341 million first language speakers of English, 210 million of those are in the United States (228 million in North America). There are 508 million including second language speakers, and 240 million of those are in the United States (260 million in North America).  I'm not even accounting for some English usage being American rather than British (or another Commonwealth country) in origin outside of North America.  It is also worrisome that some Wikipedia editors feel obliged to move pages and alter spelling on the basis that Commonwealth English is not only more correct, but is also more common than either American English or North American English. (My United States figures are actually a bit low since they date from 1984 and most of the other figures are from the late 1990s.)  I believe the US probably has the most influence on the English language today, although only partially due to the influence of numbers.  More of the influence is through movies, television, books, the internet, and other media.  More immediately, I think Wikipedia would benefit from a clearer definition and analysis of the various types of English, including different orthographies.   My figures are primarily from http://www.ethnologue.com/  [[User:Daniel Quinlan|Daniel Quinlan]] 08:21, Aug 3, 2003 (UTC)

:The main thing that concerns me is when British English is taken as a familiar norm in descriptions of other languages.  I've seen pronunciation guides that say to pronounce ''Goethe'' as "Gertie," for example.  Reference to the variety of broad A and O sounds in British English are other frequent sources of confusion; most North Americans don't even hear the sounds as separate phonemes.  Since the introduction of the IPA this sort of thing is seen less often, but there's still a lot of it in older reference books; and older reference books have a way of being perpetuated here. 

:Some writers on British English treat American English with profound condescension.  This annoys especially when you realize that the prestige dialect of British English is strongly bound to social class --- you had to have gone to a handful of the "right" boarding schools to get it exactly right --- and a dialect spoken by a much smaller percentage of the population of the British Isles than Standard American is in North America.  There's a passage in Fowler's ''The King's English'' that mocks American place names like ''Indianapolis'' and ''Memphis'', as if ''Bognor Regis'' or ''Stow-on-the-Wold'' were superior in euphony or dignity.  This tradition is not wholly dead among the prescriptive usage writers, and I think that some North Americans are still cowed by it.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|IHCOYC]] 13:58, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::"Proper" British English is not simply the preserve of the public school elite - whilst it may be true that those from the public schools may be more likely to use RP in their everyday speech, most across the nation know how to use the correct form and do so for official documents etc., even if they revert to their local dialect for normal usage. Even though I was comprehensive-schooled (in Scotland nonetheless) I still know how to correctly use the English Language and so do those around me.

Oh the superiority of everything American! Hah! Considering the linguistic inabilities of your president, the hilarity of watching winners of Oscars trying to construct sentences and the sheer inability of an astonishing number of American students to communicate in any even moderately articulate manner (which is why a number of European universities in the last five years have been forced to start summer courses for visiting American students with special 'basic english' grinds explaining such things as use of verbs, definite and indefinite articles, how to use the past tense!!!) America can hardly brag about its skill or knowledge of english. The lame excuse about comparing population numbers is a nonsense. American english (well at least the lliterate variety) is found on the American continent. The result of the world uses British english or a nativised version of British english, in which some aspects of American english may make an appearance. In no sense can American english claim the right to be ''the'' international brand of english and it is a particularly ludicrous form of arrogance to think it can, based on the fact that there are more people in America that in Britain, Ireland, Australia. But the worst form of 'so called' english has got to be MTV english, which consists of nothing more than a string of empty-headed, poorly constructed cliches with all the substance of a quarter pounder and fries. :-) [[User:Jtdirl|FearÉIREANN]] 14:41, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)

I'm not sure of the point of this discussion. Whoever added "oxymoron" to this article was obviously aiming tickle a few ribs with some humo'''u'''r. I am given to understand from the couple of business trips I've made to Sweden that they very sensibly take courses in Business English (which leans towards British English as much of Sweden's business is cent'''r'''ed on the EU) and Technical English (which leans towards American English for spellings like 'program' and 'color' extensively used in software). Whatever the figures say (and I dispute the validity of your source Daniel which quotes only 11 million speakers of English in India from a 1960s survey) there's no denying that a significant number of people prefer to read and write in British English. It's just the same with American English of course; only the vast majority of British English speakers don't live in the state of technical bliss that is the USA. On Wikipedia we quite rightly have a policy at http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Americo-centric_point_of_view decrying Americo-centrism in view of the fact that this is an international encyclop'''a'''edia. It's a shame that attempts to roll-back Americo-centrism as sometimes paranoiacally(sic) seen [[anti-Americanism]] by certain individuals. Let the status quo survive.

:The two points I actually sought to make was that calling American English an "oxymoron" struck me as a violation of NPOV; and that assuming easy familiarity with the phonemic structure of British English is not a good idea in explaining the pronunciation of non-English words.  I do admit to being somewhat ornery about the Brits presuming to judge "Americanisms," and the supposed pre-eminence and universality of the [[Boarding school|British boarding-school]] dialect.   I went to grade school in Canada, and learned a subset of the British spellings myself.  I'm not on a tear to remove them.

You are a bit behind the times as regards english dialects. The days when Oxbridge english was viewed as the correct version have long long since gone. Right now, a BBC programme is on using scouse (a dialect I hate, BTW. It sounds to me like a cat chewing a wasp.) But BBC Four seems to require it. 'Proper english', ie, Oxbridge, has been out of fashion for decades, with Estuary English, Scouse etc far more popular. BTW 2 (sounds like a TV station that!:-)  I came across a US student's history essay that has down in my university's history as one of the worst attempt at communication ever witnessed. (You'll enjoy this!) Writing about the Irish [[Easter Rising]], an American woman (allegedly a history major, though I find it hard to believe!) wrote:

:''It is like the Irish don't like the english and their rules. So they like rebel in Easter. Patrik (sic) Pierce (sic) leads the rebells (sic) and they take a big post office in Oconnel (sic) street, and they gang up on the British. And they tell them like 'no queen here'. But the english don't like it and send in their soldiers from the first world war in France or somewhere to stop them. And the english like arrest Pierce and devillera (sic) and lock them in a big prisom (sic) but the Irish keep rebelling and rebelling and get their new republic with devillera as president and Michael Collin's (sic) becomes his right hand man. And then they fight a war of independents. And the Irish throws the english out and then have a civil war, where Collin's is killed at Bale na Bla (sic) and Northern Ireland joins england and the queen.''

AAAAAGH! And that is only ''one'' paragraph. The strange thing was that the woman could not understand when she got a fail mark for the paper! She said she had never failed anything before in her life. The question on all our lips was, how could she have possibly ''passed'' a single exam in her life, let alone make it to college? But she was the worst. Nobody else has ever quite hit that level of awfulness, though every year some try and come close! :-) [[User:Jtdirl|FearÉIREANN]] 20:03, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:[[Anti-intellectualism]] (zeech!  that page needs a real article) is a major feature of the culture of the USA.  One of the many ways this trait manifests is in a certain impatience with usage norms.  Reading is a solitary vice to most Americans, and it gives you no fresh air and exercise.  There are indeed many US high schools who would look at that paper and see that the student had learned where the event took place, who the combatants were, and kept in mind enough proper nouns to make small talk about the Uprising.  And that would in the minds of many teachers be enough.  Spelling and grammar is another department.  

:Now if you want to hear ugly English, let me send you to [[Tennessee]].  The speech of that state, especially in the female mouth, sounds like a cat being tortured.  

::You haven't heard an [[Ozark]] dialect then.  Then again there are both Western and Eastern accents within the Dialects.  I'm always shocked by a lot of these studies on phonology and dialects within the US...  When they get to MO, Southern Il, and Arkansas they don't tend to do enough studies, especially as the demographic centor of the US is in MO.  I can't find the article, or perhaps it was this one, but there was one a few days ago which listed the differences in the Saint Louis Metro Area from Midwestern English.  The blurb wasn't quite right but it was right in the fact that the Peoples inside Saint Louis City and in parts of the county talk different than  lets say 30 miles away in Franklin and Jeffereson counties and that the dialect is unique to St. Louis.  It was wrong becuase it grouped accents in the saint louis area which are actually in deep Franklin Counties and Jeff Counties.  The accent in Tennessee is actually pleasent compared to that of your typical Ozarkian.

==Loan words from British English==

I've removed the table of loan-words from English. American English ''is'' a form of English, so there can't be loan-words from itself. If it was meant to represent loan-words from ''British'' English, then that's wrong too; such words as ''draperies, rooster, skillet'' just don't exist in current British English. To say they come from an earlier from of British English is hardly an argument, since the great majority of American English does derive from an earlier form of British English!

What the table was listing was '''differences''' between American and British usage - not loan-words - so I've moved the relevant entries from that table to [[List_of_American_English_words_not_used_in_British_English]].  [[User:Spellbinder|Spellbinder]] 14:25, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:''The northern cities ... extending west through [[Cleveland, Ohio]] ... have undergone a shift ... where the vowels in the words ''stuck'', ''stalk'', ''stock'', and ''stack'' have shifted from [&#652;], [&#596;], [&#593;], [&#230;] (SAMPA [V], [O], [A], [}]) to [&#596;], [&#593;], [a], [e&#230;] (SAMPA [O], [A], [a], [e}]). ''

Does this truly happen? I live in Cleveland, and I pronounce ''stuck'', ''stalk'', ''stock'', and ''stack'' as /stVk/, /stOk/, /stAck/ and /st{k/, and as far as I know, everyone I know that lives here pronounces them the same. [[User:GusGus|Gus]] 03:51, 2004 Apr 2 (UTC)

== American English#Loanwords not common in British English ==

I am confused why the definition of hacienda 'a type of ranch house' replaced 'principal house on a ranch'.<br/>
[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hacienda Dictionary.com/hacienda] has:
#A large estate or plantation in Spanish-speaking countries.
#The house of the owner of such an estate.
[http://m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=hacienda&x=23&y=16 Merriam-Webster Online] has:
# : a large estate especially in a Spanish-speaking country : PLANTATION

Are these American dictionaries incorrect? [[User:Paedia|P]]<u>'''[[user talk:Paedia|æ]]'''</u>[[user:Paedia|dia]] 15:17, 2004 May 24 (UTC)

I'm confused by this too.  The first definition of 'hacienda' isn't distinct from 'estate' as used by Americans, so I figured not to include it.  A house is a hacienda because of its function as the main house, not because of any sort of architectural features implied by 'a type of ranch house'.  The dictionaries jibe with how I've heard and seen the word used. --[[User:Atemperman|Atemperman]] 22:59, 29 May 2004 (UTC)

==Cape==
I wish to question the inclusion of '''cape''' with the meaning ''headland'' as being American English. Even if derived from a native american language, it seems to have entered both American and Brtish English quickly and equally.
Witness: Cape Town, Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope, Cape Province (all 17th-18th century, some possibly earlier). And 18th century English explorers named many capes in Australia and New Zealand - the majority of headlands in NZ being named cape.

==Removed claim==
I took out this content:

:A key area where American English has grown (on both sides of the Atlantic), is in the world of business and commerce, where use of the [[rhetorical euphemism]] is common. One example would be the phrase "are you comfortable with that". This phrase will typically be used by a business manager introducing a change which may, or may not, be welcome. A negative answer is neither expected nor, indeed, invited. However, the question is, at least on the face of it, conciliatory.

:However, it was the British composers Gilbert and Sullivan who felt it necessary to point out that their ideal officer in [[HMS Pinafore]] "almost always said 'If you please.'".

because there didn't seem to be any evidence and it seems like an awfully vague assertion. Also, it only really applies to the "corporate-ese" variety of American English.

==IPA vs SAMPA==

Can we (meaning "I") get rid of the SAMPA annotations? The beginning of the article has a box telling the reader that IPA is going to be used, and links to an article providing assistance if eir browser is having trouble with it. IPA is really the only standard we need for phonetic notation &mdash; it appears in every dictionary I've seen, it's all we use in the linguistics community, and it's very well-defined. The SAMPA annotations are cumbersome, not as well-understood or commonly used, and pointless in the dawning age of Unicode. The doubling of pronunciations in IPA and SAMPA makes for very unattractive clutter in my opinion. Maybe there's something I'm overlooking here, but I really don't think we need SAMPA in this article (or in many others). Comments? [[User:Jeeves|Jeeves]] 05:25, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Scope of American English ==

It needs to be made clear whether American English is being used to refer to US, North American or true American English.  If the article is only supposed to refer to US English, it also needs to mention the existence of other English dialects in America like Canadian, Carribean, &c English with links to their articles.  Or else, there needs to be a seperate article, [[English of the Americas]], prominently linked to from here (or this needs moving to [[US English]] to make room for such an article here).

::The objection to the use of the adjective "American" to describe things of the United States of America is well-understood and widely recognized.

::People who wish that the word were not used this way are not ''confused'' by its use. They ''object'' to it, much as many Trotskyists object to the use of the term "socialism" to describe the economics of the Stalinist Soviet Union.

::However, we also have to write Wikipedia articles in some language or another.

:::To a linguist, "American English" means only English as spoken in the United States, unambiguously and precisely. English spoken in North America is "North American English". English spoken in both North and South America (which isn't really a meaningful grouping from a linguistic perspective) is "Pan-American English" or "English as spoken in the Americas". There is nothing ambiguous about "American English". The fact that some people may be confused by that doesn't make it ambiguous, it just means they're not familiar with how the terminology is used. That's why it says '''in the first sentence''' that American English means English spoken in the United States&mdash;to clarify for those people who might be confused. The proposed alternative, "U.S. English" has the disadvantage of not being the normal term used by experts in the field in addition to being the name of a controversial organization. The ambiguity cased by the name "American English", which only affects those people who think that American primarily refers to the continents, is much less significant than the ambiguity caused by "U.S. English".

== Phonology ==

In the Phonology section, this sentence bothers me:
''Its rhotic pronunciation was derived from Hiberno-English and Scottish English, as large numbers of Irish and Scottish settlers resided.''

The pronoun should be clarified as it's not entirely clear whether it refers to the rhotic change, or to one of the varieties of English which did or did not participate. Additionally, it makes little sense... the Irish and Scottish settlers resided ''where?'' I'm guessing that the original intent of the sentence was: "The rhotic trill's pronunciation was derived from Hiberno-English and Scottish English, as large numbers of Irish and Scottish settlers resided in England."

If that's not the intent of the sentence, then I don't really know what it is. If that ''is'' the intent, I'm not sure why it's even included in the article, as it has little to do with the pronunciation in North America, and more to do with the pronunciation in the UK.

Any thoughts? I'm in favor of dropping the sentence altogether.

== Phonology ==

It does not make sense to say that a dialect of a language is "conservative in its phonology" ([[American English#Phonology]]). Every dialect changes in a different way, but it changes anyway.
*It is true that some varieties change more rapidly than others, though. For example, speakers of Modern Icelandic can understand the sagas written a millennium ago, while no Modern English speaker could understand an Old English text without training. It makes sense that if one language can change more rapidly than another that the same would be true for dialects, that divergent dialects do not change at exactly the same rate and one variety resembles the proto-dialect more. &mdash; [[User:Livajo|&#1051;&#1080;&#1074;&#1072;&#1081;]] | [[User talk:Livajo|&#x263a;]] 07:28, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Mergers, mergers, and more mergers ==

All these mergers in the Phonology section are getting out of hand. For one thing, there's no differentiation between mergers that are found in both British and American English and those that are unique to American English:

*pour-poor (highly stigmatized in the U.S. but thoroughly normal in England)
*whine-wine (increasingly popular in the U.S. and virtually complete in England)
*horse-hoarse (virtually complete in both countries)

==American English an oxymoron?==
North Americans are always going to win this argument as it's a North American website.
:''This isn't an argument between North Americans and Brits. It's an argument between you and the rest of the world.''

:Thats an odd perspective. I know dozens of speakers of Spanish. They call it Spanish, my Spanish Class calls it Spanish. However, it is Mexican Spanish. Almost no one, except George Bush Jr., calls it Mexican. - Cemendur

:I can see two real complaints with calling "American" the English of the United States. The United States has several competing standards - pop cultural standards of conforming to Californian English, academic standards of conforming to Standard Western American English (as spoken on the campus of Berkeley), and academic standards of conforming to Standard Eastern American English (as spoken at Yale). We also have regional dialects. The other is the general use of the word American by United States citizens. Our neighbors no the North and South generally take offense to the notion that they are not "American". - Cemendur


'''Nice comment - helps build bridges and friends here'''
:It wasn't intended as a personal attack. It's just you seem to be the only person making an issue of this.

The point is, English was the language spoke by the peoples of England. Further languages based on this have evolved. This is the key, they are no longer English. You can't have 'American English' (Somthing of or belonging to England, belonging to America), aside from the fact they fought the British Empire for independance, they invented a new language.
THIS IS NOT A DIALECT. It is a new language, originally derived from English. English itself is derived of other languages, but we don't refer to it as "English Greek", or such. It is therefore incorrect to refer to this as 'American English' language.

:''Is the same true of Scottish English, Welsh English, Irish English, Canadian English, Australian English, New Zealand English, South African English, and Indian English? Are those "new languages" according to your way of thinking too? Incidentally, English is not derived from Greek.''
'''Ok, so using Greek was a very poor example. English Roman Saxon? Still - you didn't disprove my point!'''
'''As to your further point Scottish English is also unacceptable, Scots may speak with regional differences, a very small amount write with these differences. The difference here is that American's have changed the grammar, spelling and meaning of words, thereby creating a new language - not a dialect of an existing one. I am willing to conceed Scottish English may be a dialect of English, but American is not, its a new Language'''
:The differences in grammar, semantics, and even pronunciation between British and American English are infinitesimally small compared to their similarities. Spelling has nothing to do with language anyway (if anything's an oxymoron it's "written language"). The point is, since there's no hard-and-fast definition of "language" as opposed to "dialect", the decision whether various related speech forms are to be considered separate languages or dialects of the same language ultimately has to be made on nonlinguistic grounds (common culture, history, etc.). Generally, if speakers of various related speech forms consider themselves to be speaking dialects of the same language, then that's the terminology people use. And I have no doubt that the vast majority of English speakers throughout the world agree that Engilsh English, Scottish English, Welsh English, Irish English, Canadian English, American, Australian English, New Zealand English, South African English, and Indian English are all dialects of one English language, and not separate languages. [[Scots language|Scots]], on the other hand, is generally considered a separate language. --[[User:Angr|Angr]]/[[User_talk:Angr|<sub>{{IPA|tɔk tə mi}}</sub>]] 29 June 2005 16:53 (UTC)

Any opinions on whether the British/Canadian spelling will become common in the United States several years from now?? Please feel free to give several external links talking about this. [[User:Georgia guy|Georgia guy]] 18:42, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<div style="border: 0.1em dashed gray; padding: 1em;">''From [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]]:''

* '''Object.''' ''Grey'' is not an exclusively Canadian spelling, and while largely a British usage, it was the original spelling, and ''Gray'' is just an American variant.  While UK-influenced English predominantly uses ''Grey'', American usage is roughly split between both ''Gray'' and ''Grey.'' As an aside, the ''Dictionary Society of North America'' recently released reports on the growing usage and increased popularity of British English spellings in the United States...blaming the phenomenon in part for the large number of UK-expatriate editors who take publishing jobs in the United States and influence the language in the editing and production.  Etymologically, it comes from the Middle English ''grei'' and further back from the Old English ''graeg''.  The disambiguation at [[Gray]] is fine as it is, and given the variety of topics covered (people, physics, color) all the more necessary.  LASTLY, we have a policy around here about not bickering between American English and British English usage, please read [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]], which establishes the policy stating ''American spellings need not be respelled to British standards nor vice-versa'' and states that alternate spellings may require redirects...which is done appropriately here. &mdash;[[User:ExplorerCDT|ExplorerCDT]] 06:30, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:This isn't even true. Both spellings ''grey'' and ''gray'' are equally old, both first attested in the 14th century; even in Old English there was variation between ''gr&#x1e3;&#x121;'' and ''gr&#x113;&#x121;''. --[[User:Angr|Angr]] 18:49, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Youse for You in northern midwest ==

The use of "youse" rather than "you", if it has ever been a hallmark of northern midwestern speech, is long since gone.  It is regarded by speakers in at least Wisconsin and Minnesota, as a hallmark of New Jersey (esp.) speech.  The use of "You all", sometimes (although not commonly enough to qualify as a "hallmark pronuncition") as a plural form (ONLY, unlike the common use for singular and plural in "the south") is actually fairly common, but "youse" is used only sarcastically.

When I made my statement about "the south", it was meant to refer, not to "you all", but rather to "y'all", or '''''ez zei sei ne saut''''', "yaowl", which I have heard often used to refer to people in the 2nd person, regardless of number.

== Are these traits for southern Illinois speech very well known? ==

None of the page described anything like the speech around here:
*The mentioned ''roof''/''root''/''book'' merger does not usually occur (they are {{IPA|/&#633;u&#720;f/}}, {{IPA|/&#633;u&#720;t/}}, and {{IPA|/b&#650;k/}}, respectively).
*The use of ''out'' to mean "off" when referring to a light is common, as in "Turn the light out," otherwise the standard ''off'' is used, as in "The plate fell off the table" or "Turn the computer off."
*The ''pin''/''pen'' merger occurs.
*Some people sound somewhat like people in the southern part of the United States (although almost everyone has rhotic speech), though most people have accents more like that of "standard" American English.
*[[æ-tensing|[æ]-tensing]] occurs.
*{{IPA|[z]}} sounds in contractions often become {{IPA|[d]}}; for example, ''doesn't'' sounds like "dudn't."
*''Something'' often sounds like "sunt'm" {{IPA|/s&#652;n&#660;m&#809;/}} instead of the standard {{IPA|/s&#652;m&#952;i&#331;/}}.

:Most of these sound like characteristics of [[Southern American English]], which I have often heard extends into southern Illinois and southern Indiana.

== use of "skosh" ==

I've heard this term used more than once (in Wisconsin and Minnesota), although I don't know if it's from japanese.

:I'm extremely suspicious of a phrasal degree adjective like this being borrowed into English from Japanese (or borrowed into any language for that matter). Those types of words tend to be a closed class, changing very little over the generations. What you're hearing perhaps has a different meaning or etymology. Also, I don't think the Japanese population in the USA would be sufficient to instigate generic borrowings. If you could give some authentic examples though, it could be really interesting...

I won't pretend to speak Japanese, so I'm unsure what "sukoshi" means, precisely, in Japanese, but I can tell you that it's used here to mean "a smidgin" or "a li'l bit".  As for what you mean by "authentic examples", I'm unsure...it sounds like you're possibly calling me a liar for saying "I've heard this term more than once".  I have made no claims regarding the etymology nor widespread use of this term.  As for the likelihood that a term could have gained acceptance and widespread usage in light of a small immigrant Japanese population, that's possibly the most bogus argument I've ever heard.  The Filipino population in the US is not that big, but everyone knows what the "boondocks" are.  The Malay population is not impressively large, but everyone knows what an orangutan is.  I could continue with such words as "amok", "pariah", "curry", "batik", "atoll" (ooh, the Maldive immigrant community is just HUGE!), etc.  What makes this argument even less impressive is that the Japanese form a significant, if not majority, of the population of Hawaii, the native language of which has, for all the insignificance of its mainland immigrant population, given AmE the words "hula", "luau", "Pele" (not the soccer player), "poi", and "aloha", among others.

:::I'm not sure how you got the impression that I was "calling you a liar", but I wasn't at all. I was just thirsty for more information as I'm a linguistics student, I've never heard of this phenomenon before, and I would be interested in analyzing it. I'm sorry you find my "argument" to be "less than impressive", but you should consider statistical realities: heavy lateral borrowing, to such an extent that a language gains words in a closed class, has generally occurred when an immigrant population was quite large, or when a country was invaded (British Aisles by Normans, China by Mongols, etc). I'm not saying that this is the only way a language could pick up a new closed-class word, but that it's unlikely. French is a major donor to the English language, yet no one uses ''tr&grave;s'' to mean "very" or ''beaucoup'' to mean "much", except to show deliberate affectation. Not to be nitpicking or anything, but ''orangutan'' and ''boondocks'' are not really the same kind of borrowing as ''sukoshi'' would be. Obviously ''ape'' and ''a little bit'' belong to very different lexical classes.  I feel like I'm lecturing here, but most borrowings from Japanese into English are nouns, and interestingly, all the words you mention are also nouns, many of which are related to local phenomena (hula, atoll, etc). We see the same thing with ''sushi'' , ''tsunami'', ''karate'',  ''honcho'' (emphasizing role of hierarchy in Japanese business). My point is that I'm highly skeptical that any dialect of English has actually absorbed ''sukoshi'' as a completely assimilated equivalent for ''a little bit''. Do children use it? Are English syntactic rules applied to it? Do we see this borrowing spreading out from a geographic area where it occurred? Can we find it in recent literature, even newspapers and magazines? Until I saw proof tha all those were true, I would consider it to be a local affectation at most. But please do prove me wrong if you can, as such a borrowing from Japanese (in the true sense of being assimilated into English) would be fascinating. I might also check with a former professor of mine who specializes in Japanese sociolinguistics. [[User:Jeeves|Jeeves]] 05:11, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

Both "très" and "beaucoup" are used as adjectives in everyday American idiolects, albethey pronounced like the English word "tray" for très, and "búku" (as opposed to bokú) for beaucoup.  At no point have I ever seen their usage cause any confusion as to their meaning.  That said, you'll note I never claimed that the word "skosh" was borrowed from Japanese.  I merely mentioned that I have heard it numerous times, and ''apparently'' with the same meaning as "sukoshi" has in Japanese.  How significant might it be from a paradigm perspective?  I don't know, and I don't particularly care.  I was simply reporting in response to the comment, as I've already said, made by the person who deleted the mention of '''''skosh''''' from the article.

:::::Flamewar? I'm sorry you feel that way. I think our disagreement here hinges on what should be considered a loanword, and having actually studied linguistics, I seem to be thinking of stricter criteria. English closed classes have incorporated borrowed words before (the example that comes to my mind most readily is ''via'' from French/Romance, which became a preposition), so it's certainly not impossible. It's just unlikely. I would be interested to see a formal study done on the area or dialect you claim has incorporated ''sukoshi''. You're not the only one who thinks so, as someone else added it in the first place. As for the other things you mention, again there's the question of loanwords versus local or subcultural affectations. If ''sukoshi'' is really a loanword, it should be broadly used, picked up by children and foreigners of non-Japanese extraction learning English in America, and exhibit the same behavior as any other adjectival in American English. Sorry for insisting on what you probably consider formalities, but at the same time I wish non-linguists would be a little more reserved about making such claims. I wouldn't make claims about quantum physics, having little background in the subject. Sorry about the "aisles" mistake, it was late. I reiterate that if there is real evidence of ''sukoshi'' being borrowed into English, I'd be interested to see the evidence, outside of an entry in someone's dictionary or other non-linguistic anecdotes.

Curious about whether or not I might have picked up "skosh" from my brother, who studied Japanese for 7 years in HS and university, or perhaps from a former president of the local synagogue, who has spent several years in Japan, or perhaps from my grandfather, z"l, who was in Japan during WW2, I went and asked a few people who didn't have such influences today.

Sorry to try to reply in a way such as this, but I'm extremely daunted by the various tags in place, so I hope that I don't cause more headdaches than necessary in this. In the entire article referring to the influences on Japanese on American English, most of the words in place strike me as mostly Hawaiian English Creole rather than a variety of American English. Sashimi as raw fish, for example, is commonplace in Hawaii, but is popularly called sushi everywhere else. Skosh, similarly, is popularly known in that language.
In general, it seems that there are two categories in this section and it'd cause less confusion if they were treated as such. Da kine, especially would probably require a whole article to explain as it has no meaning whatsoever to "the best," but rather, acts as a placeholder for any other word, similarly to how a pronoun replaces a given noun. In da kine's case, though, it commonly replaces adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Its unique feature in the language also holds a prominent place in the local culture. [[User:Kamitra|Kamitra]] 19 Jul 2005
:Concerning the difference between sushi and sashimi, in the speech of most Americans, sushi is cut raw fish, and sashimi is a word they've never heard of, which is why I went back and changed the definition of "sushi" to reflect that.  It may be a good idea to tag the ones that are yoused primarily only in Hawai`i with "primarily in Hawaii" or something.  On the other hand, "skosh" I don't believe entered American English through Hawaii or even the pre-WWII Japanese population (predominantly) in the western US; instead it seems likely that it was brought back to the US by members of the military serving in Japan, not ''during'' the war, but ''after''.

Just an added note.  My Mom comes from Scotland and her and her whole family use the word "Skosh" to mean "A little bit".  My dad grew up in Washington DC and his family also uses the word Skosh in the same way.  In my experience it is a word used around the country more often than not by the "Baby Boom" generation and unknown by the generations following them.

==Central and South Florida==

I've lived in Florida(both central AND south florida) and this whole section seems wrong. i'm going to think about this section over the next couple days, and then perhaps make a few changes or even rewrite the entire section. Anyone who has lived or spent substantial time in florida, please give input. (and i don't mean those who spent 2 weeks as a tourist- if you spent your whole time at the disney resort or in touristy areas of miami, you might as well say you haven't been to [[Florida]]. My critique of the section as a life long Floridian:

* First of all, I'm not sure including a section on "Central and South Florida" is valid when discussing Regional American dialects. Unlike the rest of the dialects mentioned in "Regional Differences", Florida English is a lot more dynamic. Sure, people move in and move out of other areas of the country, but not as much as occurs in Florida. Is there a single  '''unique''' Central and/or South Florida dialect someone can point to  and say, "that's it !" ??? I doubt it.
* The intro to the section states "The speech of Central and South Florida (everything South of and including Orlando) is noticeable for not being a typical southern accent." Go to a bar in [[Fort Meade, Florida|Ft. Meade]], [[Saint Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]], or [[Clewiston, Florida|Clewiston]] or even "The Chuck Wagon" in south Miami-Dade County and tell everyone, "Gosh everyone here sounds like a Yankee, " and see their reaction. And even north of the line drawn by the author(s) of this section, there are areas where the accent is predominantly "northern"- [[Daytona Beach]] for one. Perhaps it is a matter of urban/rural- transplants to Florida tend to move to cities/suburbs as opposed to rural areas. And perhaps many other southern cities, notably [[Atlanta]] are becoming less "Southern" in their speech.
* the article continues: " because a large proportion of the inhabitants of the area are either natives of the Northeast (and therefore speakers of accents like New York-New Jersey English)" while this is true to some extent in South Florida and in pockets of Central Florida, there are also a large number of people from new england and the  midwest in Florida. As more generations have been born in Florida with roots elsewhere, it seems there's become what one could call a "generic" northern accent in much of southern florida. Perhaps Florida is ahead of the trend where wider [[media]] tends to blur dialects.
* "There are even stories of going through a drive-through at a fast food restaurant... " I like [[urban legends]]. Seriously, I went through 30 states on a roadtrip last October, and was greeted in Spanish in drive thrus in at least 10 of them. Typically, they don't greet you in Spanish in Miami in drives thru anymore, because fast-food restaurant managers get sick of the customer complaints sent to their national headquarters. Believe me, I know hundreds of Anglos in Miami who love the free food coupons they get sent when they complain about being addressed in Espanol. The part about [[Spanglish]] is a valid point, although this isn't unique in South Florida.
* My own personal life (from a linguistic perspective): I was born in [[Riverside, New Jersey]], my father was from [[Clifton, New Jersey]], my mother from [[Cadillac, Michigan]]. We moved to [[Miami-Dade County]] before I was a month old. Growing up in the [[70's]] in Miami, I don't recall a huge number of native Spanish speakers in school until the late 70's (and I went to an Elementary School on 8th Street). We left Miami in the early [[80's]] as part of the "Last American out of Miami, please take the flag" movement. We moved to [[Bartow]], [[Polk County, Florida]] in Central Florida. My classmates there tended to make fun of my "Yankee" accent through much of my middle/high school years(listening to tapes of my voice then, i did seem to have somewhat of a "New York" accent , albeit not a distinct one. When I moved back to South Florida after high school, my old friends laughed at my "southern accent". Today, the average person would say I was from the midwest ( a college professor, an "expert" on American dialect once insisted I must be from Ohio, probably in the [[Ohio River]] valley. ) So there's the tale of one Floridian and his dialect. Am I a typical Southern/Central Floridian ? Is there a typical Central/Southern Floridian? [[User:Jcam|Jcam]] 05:27, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I can't speak to the question of central and south Florida specifically, because I've never been there and I've never read anything about the local accent there. But more generally I can say:
:*It is extremely likely that there ''is'' a local accent of the region, but that not everyone who lives there uses it. That seems to be the case everywhere else in the country.
:*The best people to interview to discover the local accent are those who still live in the town where they were born, and whose parents also grew up in the same town. Children's accents are influenced both by their parents and by other children, and adults who live in the same town where they grew up are unlikely to have changed the accent they had as a child.
:*Remember that Wikipedia is not the place for original research. Don't post anything about the local accent based on your own observations; rather, go to the library and find out what's been published about the local accent, and summarize that here, citing your sources.
:*<s>If something already written here strikes you as unlikely, and no source is cited for it, attach the <nowiki>{{unsourcedsect}}</nowiki> tag to it to alert people to the problem, and if no one adds a source for it within a week or so, feel free to remove it.</s>
:*I see the tag is already there. So go ahead and remove anything unsourced that you have a problem with, but bring it here for possible discussion with people who think it's right. (added 08:15, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))
:*"I actually have to disagree. I was born and raised in the town of Windermere, which is a few miles west of Orlando. I have been obversving the accents where I live and go to school (I go to school in Orlando), and the accents here are predominately Southern, with the exceptions of those of Hispanic heritage who speak with a Spanish accent. 'Y'all' is said quite a lot instead of the more Northern version, 'You guys.' Central Floridian and North Floridian dialects sound the same to me - they are Southern-influenced. Although, the dialects in Miami-Dade County, are sounding Northern-influenced, mainly because of immigrants. Rural areas of South Florida are extremely Southern, especially around the Everglades and on the south-west side of Florida. All in all, the only Northern-sounding accents in Florida, are those currently residing in the Miami area." - Jennifer, from Florida.

== St. Louis ==

One quick thing thats been bugging me: the St. Louis sub-section refers to "measure" as /ˈmeɪʒ.ɚ/ and "wash" as /wɔɹʃ/ . These two forms are very distinct to the southern Indiana dialect mentioned earlier in the Midwest section. If these forms are present in St. Louis it is most likely from Hoosier influence.

Also, is the mispronounciation of mostaccioli really necessary?

== Southern Indiana ==

I would go ahead and write a southern Indiana sub-section myself, but i do not know IPA and phonology well enough. I would be happy to describe some aspects of the dialect (for example, "fish" is pronounced "feesh") if someone would be willing to disect the phonology. I feel at least some aspects should be mentioned in the article, as it is a very unique and distinct way of speaking.

:Okay, but remember that Wikipedia has a [[WP:NOR|policy against original research]].

::::The problem is that the adjective ''American'' has two meanings: (1) of or relating to the United States of America; (2) of or relating to the continents of North and South America. The first meaning is far more ''useful'' because it is much more often that one speaks about something that is related to the United States than something related to the two continents. Because it's more useful, it's also much more common, and because it's more common, it's the meaning that people assume is meant by ''American''. So, even though there are some people who would like to assert that ''American'' only means sense (2), those people are tilting at windmills. The overwhelming mass of usage is for sense (1).

Sorry I don't know how to fix this myself, but I noticed that there is an article for Trinidadian English (well, a stub), but it is not listed in the table on the side of this article.  Someone who knows out how to edit that table should add it in.

== Sources needed for these derivations ==

I've moved these words to the discussion page because it's not obvious why they're in the section for words derived from French.

; [[jambalaya]] : rice cooked with herbs, spices, and ham, chicken, or seafood
; [[zydeco]] : a native Louisiana style of music

(In the case of zydeco, there's a suggestion that it comes from a song beginning, "Les haricots...", but the Wikpedia article says this is contested and it certainly seems a long way from ''les haricots'' to ''zydeco''.)

If someone can provide good sources for the derivation of these words, perhaps they could put them back in an appropriate section with the source. [[User:Adrian Robson|Adrian Robson]] 08:33, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

== Questionable loanwords ==

The loanwords list is goofy.  Many of the loanwords, I'd guess 30%, are generally not considered English.  They are considered foreign words, but everyone knows what they mean; there is a profound difference.  ''Cojones'', ''frijoles'', ''jefe'', ''hombre'', ''lagniappe'', ''pirogue'', ''Barangay'', ''klahanie'', ''skookum'', ''da kine'', and ''sayonara'' are no more considered English than the equally commonly used ''agua'' or ''adiós''.  [[User:Tempshill|Tempshill]] 21:52, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

Totally agree, for a loanword to be relevant it needs to express something not available in the host language.  "Machismo" would seem correct, but "hombre" is just a figure of speach. [[User:Stamford spiney|Stamford spiney]] 19:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

I'm not convinced that a list of actual loanwords is even relevant, is it? [[User:NickelShoe|NickelShoe]] 23:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

For the record, I have every intention of editing the article to get rid of the list in a few days if no one says anything.  I think that the concept of loanwords in American English is relevant, but a list of them should only be used (in this article) to illustrate that concept, and, as such, only about five good examples would be reasonable.

::It certainly needs to be clarified. What does it mean to say that this is a list of words common in American English but not common in British English? Take ''raccoon'' for example. I don't suppose there are any raccoons in Britain, so the need for the word is relatively limited. But that doesn't mean that the word is unknown. I would guess that 99.9% of the population has seen them on American films and has no trouble coming up with the word when needed. Americans see raccoons more often so they use the word more often. But so what? 

::By contrast, turkey and potatoes, both exports from America to Britain, have their names used all the time in Britain because people see them both every time they visit a supermarket. So all three words are known in both countries but the subject of one of them (raccoon) is seen more often in one country than the other. This may tell us something about the wildlife of the two countries but does it tell us anything useful about the language?  

::In the rest of the list I would guess that most British know the words in the following list. But I doubt whether it's particularly relevant in an article about American English whether these words are commonly used by the British (or the Australians, or Canadians, or South Africans or anyone else, for that matter.)

::Cookie (used all the time), stoop (standard word in South Africa), caboose (cowboy films), café au lait, bonsai (has British enthusiasts, too), Ginseng (any health store), hunky-dory (standard in British speech), origami (books tell you how to do it), sushi (an alternative to sandwiches for lunch), sayonara, karaoke (the average pub would be surprised that this is an American import), bayou (Roy Orbison), hickory, that neck of the woods (sounds British), powwow  (cowboy films again), raccoon (see above), skunk (same as for raccoon), squash (buy them at the local supermarket), woodchuck (used in a tongue twister), moccasin, (look at the British shoe style labels), adobe (a kind of software - okay, maybe not), burrito, (get them in the supermarket), desperado (cowboy films again), enchilada (supermarket again), gringo (cowboy films), hacienda (actually that might not be widely understood), hombre (no problemo), jalopy (standard British), peccadillo (standard English since 1591 - OED), savvy (cowboy films) vamoose (cowboy films), boondocks.

[[Public school]] [[Public school (UK)]]

There is a hot debate taking place over at [[Talk:Public school (UK)]] and [[Talk:Public school]] regarding the differences between language and culture in Scotland and England, with the Scottish definition being in line with the US, Canadian, Australian and the rest-of-the-world. But a small number of English patriots seem to want to keep the various colonies in their place and have the English definition dominate the two articles.

Personally, I'm not even sure that there should be a separate article on English public schools, as they are simply a sub-topic of [[private schools]], but if there must be an article it should be called Public school (England) and not Public school (UK) (sic).

I agree that this figure appears to be unsubstantiated.  For example, if my quoted method of how this figure is arrived at is correct, then this would be to ignore the substantial number of the population in the US for which English is not their first language, and also to ignore the large number of people in other countries, for example, Sweden, Jordan and India, who speak English perfectly albeit as a second language (and which, by and large, tend to favour a non-American English flavour of English).

==Assorted Comments==

I'm really enjoying this article - nicely done! I would like to put a vote for doing a pass throughout the article to ensure that easily understood examples of the often arcane characteristics discussed are present. These really help make the article readable by anyone (with a bit of skimming over the scary looking technical bits of it by us mere mortals) when given, and I would love to encourage more! An example of this might be in the:

'''English words obsolete outside the U.S.'''
:''The subjunctive mood is livelier in North American English than it is in British English; it appears in some areas as a spoken usage, and is considered obligatory in more formal contexts in American English. British English has a strong tendency to replace subjunctives with auxiliary verb constructions.''

Here, I was a little unclear (after reading the subjunctive mood link) on just what this was in the end - an example would be great for who are unfamiliar with this. 

Again, those portions of the article that provide simple examples of the issue being discussed are just golden, and make the article enjoyable for anyone to read. [[User:Dxco|Dxco]] 23:25, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== Nasalization patterns in American English ==
Can anyone provide any insights into the nasalization patterns in American English? I think they're pretty distinctive of Am.E. <small>&mdash;''The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by'' [[User:171.64.133.51|171.64.133.51]] ([[User talk:171.64.133.51|talk]]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/171.64.133.51|contribs]]) 23:52, 17 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned2-->
:Unsourced?  Sure!  Vowels preceding [n] are nasalized most of the time, especicially if they are followed thereafter by another consonant phoneme.  As I've said elsewhere previously, "can" (the modal verb (not the object, which is [kʰæn]), is [kʰən] and "can't" is [kʰæⁿʔ].  Interestingly enough, "cant" is actually usually [kʰæntʰ], my guess is because of the infrequency with which it's used in common speech.  A particular favorite of mine, pursuing this example, is that a sentence in vernacular upper Midwestern such as "You can't help me?" is pronounced as {{IPA|[ju kʰæⁿ nɛlp̚ mi]}} or emphatically (emphasis on any of the words) {{IPA|[ju kʰæⁿʔ hɛɫp̚ mi]}} or a positive question "you can help me?" {{IPA|[ju gn̩ ɛɫp̚ mi]}} or emphatically (on the "can") {{IPA|[ju kʰæⁿn hɛɫp̚ mi]}} or emphatically with emphasis on any of the other words, {{IPA|[ju kʰn̩ ɛɫp̚ mi]}}.  Delving further into this (which I find fascinating) will require bringing intonation markers into the IPA symbology as well.  Whereas languages like Spanish and even German bring the emphasized word forward in a sentence, English instead changes the stress pattern of the sentence or phrase in a schema parallelling that of Yiddish and Hebrew.

:: (A couple of irrelevant points. You should be using square brackets, like this: {{IPA|[skw̥ eː'bɹækʰəts]}}, because you're giving a very detailed account of the sounds, not slashes, which are only used when you're showing phonemes. Also, in the IPA, {{IPA|[y]}} is a front rounded vowel, French ''u'' or German ''ü''; the glide spelt in English with a ''y'' is spelt in the IPA as {{IPA|[j]}}. The American habit of pronounced "can't" so that it sound like "can" as you mention is very annoying.

Now I live in England, and 'quit' doesn't just mean leaving a location.  We certainly use 'quit' as in an action, for example 'to quit smoking.'  Also, 'to quit a job.'  Certainly not ''obsolete'' out side the USA. ''Shirelord,'' 2040 GMT 31/01/2006.
:: I just saw that and thought "huh?" as well. "Quit" is definitely used in the context of "ceasing an activity" over here (England). ([[User:195.92.168.170|195.92.168.170]] 01:41, 2 April 2006 (UTC))

== Accentless Dialect ==

I have done a lot of observations as to determine what exactly the "typical" accentless General American dialect is. Far from being closed-minded or arrogant, I believe I speak with such a dialect. I have grown up in Eastern Pennsylvania between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, which means I am pretty much far enough away from "Pittsburghese" and the "wooder" of Philadelphia. I retain the rhotic "r" sound and only merge a few vowels. "Marry" is different from "Merry" and "Mary", which sound the same to me. "Pin" and "Pen" have very different vowel sounds. For me, "Cot" and "Caught" sound exactly the same to me, unlike the New York accent, where they drink cooahfee and wook the doo-og. I do not execute Canadian Raising as well (fire/fuire and about/aboat). I think these are the main characteristics of such a theoretical accentless American dialect. There may be others. Oftentimes dialects vary even in well-defined dialect regions. For example, the Rochester, NY accent pronounces the city as "Rachester" and they eat "sneeacks". This very much resembles some of the mountain dialects of the south. People from rural areas on the eastern seaboard seem to have very similar pronounciations whether they live north or south of the Mason and Dixon line. These are just some of my cursery observations.

== cot caught ==

"The merger of {{IPA|[ɒ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}. This is the so-called cot-caught merger, where cot and caught are homophones. This change has occurred ...from the Great Plains westward. "  I doubt that!  I don't ever recall hearing this merge in California.  Can some-one check the literature? [[User:Kdammers|Kdammers]] 06:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

:The literature doesn't need to be checked. You just weren't listening. Almost all native Californians (including myself) have this merger. [[User:Nohat|Nohat]] 06:28, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

::Wow, way to be a dick, Nohat.  
::Some speakers, especially those in San Francisco, retain the distinction.  According to ''A Course in Phonology'' by Rocca and Johnson, the vowel of ''caught'' can be lowered "to {{IPA|[&#594;]}} in North America, from where it can unround into {{IPA|[&#593;]}}" and the vowel of ''cot'' can also be "unrounded to {{IPA|[&#593;]}}, and then often advanced to {{IPA|[&#593;̟]}} or even {{IPA|[a̠]}} in most words in GA and in most of the US south." [[User:Aeusoes1|AEuSoes1]] 07:29, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

:I've looked at some of the lit. now.  The natives I heard who didn't merge were in fact from in and around SF (The others, who didn't merge, were not necessarily Cal. natives.)  But looking at the maps, it seems that most of the merging takes place among inland  and southern Californians. [[User:Kdammers|Kdammers]] 04:14, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

::Those maps are not entirely accurate. The area of non-mergers in San Francisco is pretty much restricted to the city of San Francisco. Everywhere else in the Bay Area, the merger is regular among natives from the area. I have lived in the San Jose area my entire life (except when I went away to college and learned about the existence of the /ɔ/ phoneme), and have asked many people about their accents, and have never found anyone who grew up here but did not have the merger. I also work with several linguists who grew up in the Bay Area, and they agree that the cot-caught merger is a completely standard part of the local accent. I think the Phonological Atlas maps that claim San Francisco as an exceptional area is based on an extremely small set of data for the area. Not to mention the fact that San Francisco isn't even the largest population center in the Bay Area. [[User:Nohat|Nohat]] 19:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

: Okeh, I'll accept that my experience in and north of SF and near and in HMB and in LA is not typical, since I only lived there a year.  But the artile should be changed to explain the merger.  As it stands, there is no explanation what the merged phoneme is! [[User:Kdammers|Kdammers]] 04:27, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
:: The explanation is at [[Phonological history of the low back vowels]]. It would be going off on too much of tangent here at the article [[American English]] to explain the merger. It's not even really possible to say what the merged phoneme is, because it's different in different areas. In most places, the merged phoneme is {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, but in Eastern New England it's {{IPA|/ɒ/}}. [[User:Angr|Angr]]/<small>''[[User talk:Angr|talk]]''</small> 06:59, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

''The conservatism of American English is largely the result of the fact that it represents a mixture of various dialects from the British Isles.''

:Not only is it a non sequitur, but it's wrong as well. Non-central dialects of a language (dialects away from the main cultural hub of a language or from its point of origin) tend to be more conservative, and this goes for most languages; the idea that English has its own special reason for following this very typical pattern needs some strong support.

== American English and German roots ==

Hi Angr- I also thought there were some problems with the new paragraph in the intro history section, but calling them "speculative" is not quite right. It's not sourced, to be sure, but the idea that American English is closer to the non-Norman roots of English is not speculative. I would certainly want a source for the idea that the British wanted to "beautify" English, but a slight variation on that notion wouldn't be very controversial either: that many in England, especially Samuel Johnson, held the view that Norman spellings were more "fine." I think rewriting that new paragraph would be better than expunging it (if only to encourage contributions by people who seem to be serious). I've no time at the moment, but I might take a stab at it in a couple days, unless you or others would object. --[[User:Cultural Freedom|Cultural Freedom]] [[User talk:Cultural Freedom|''talk'']] 08:31, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

:For the sake of discussion, here's the paragraph in question again:
::''American English is considered closer to its Germanic roots in spelling and phonology than British English, which attempted to "beautify" the language by taking on many aspects of the Romance languages, especially French. The "a" in "bath," for example, is open and round in British English, whereas American English uses the ae-sound, as in the Germanic "ä". Many speakers of American English argue, then, that if someone says "can" with a flat a, then the word "can't" should be no different. Multiple examples of British English deviation from its Germanic roots exist. Also, words used in American English are reminiscent of those of the Middle English spoken and written by Chaucer, such as "fall" for "autumn" and "sick" for "ill," or "I guess" for "I suppose." American English intonation is more monotone and flat in comparison to the highly aspirated and up-and-down British.''
:I find little or nothing salvageable here. "Closer to its Germanic roots in spelling and phonology" is just nonsense. The vast majority of words spelled differently in Britain and America are words of Latinate origin (French, Latin, or Greek) anyway. The issue of when American English is phonologically and lexically more conservative and when it's phonologically and lexically more innovative than British English is already discussed on this page, in a much more coherent manner. The [[broad A]] of ''bath'' is a regular phonological change that, like all phonological changes, happened subconsciously in the speech of users of some dialects; to imply it was a conscious effort to make the language sound somehow "more like French" is absurd. As for American English being monotone, it might be possible using published sources to show that American English has less variation in intonation than British English, but even if it is, that doesn't support the poster's contention that American English is somehow less Romance-influenced than British English. And I don't have any idea what "highly aspirated" is supposed to mean; intonation has nothing to do with [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], nor have I ever heard that British English in general has more heavily aspirated stops than American English in general. (Cockney is said to have heavy aspiration, but not all British English is Cockney.) [[User:Angr]] 09:12, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

I agree completely that the bit about the [[broad A]] and "aspiration" is highly questionable. As for the rest, I was trying to "interpret sympathetically." That the matter of American linguistic conservativism is discussed later on in the article, and doesn't need to be mentioned here, I can agree with. But the matter of the Normanophilia of British English (what the person meant, I think, by "beautify" -- again, I'm trying to interpret kindly) is an important aspect of the history of the divergence of American and British English, one that I think is worth salvaging. This matter has been studied somewhat extensively, in part by Shakespeare scholars. (Take a look at his first folios -- which can be found via a Google search within around 40 seconds: the question of why the first folios contained mostly -or spellings of words like ''color'', along with, mostly, "center" instead of "centre," was one of the empirical data points examined by people looking into this Normanophilia.) Then there's Samuel Johnson's dictionary. --[[User: Cultural Freedom|Cultural Freedom]] [[User talk:Cultural Freedom|''talk'']] 2006-06-26 09:27 (UTC)
*I can't point to anything specific right now, but I've learned that the tendency toward the broad A in British English was an attempt to emulate the ''a'' of the Latinate languages in general, not necessarily just French.  Remember that during Shakespeare's time and after many writers were pretty enamored with Italian.  And although we might have a hard time finding a citation for this, I think the "fall" for "autumn" and "sick" for "ill," or "I guess" for "I suppose" idea has some merit.--[[User:209.242.228.152|209.242.228.152]] 18:26, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

I always thought that the main reason Americans pronounced the 'a' in bath the way they do is because most English speakers who went to America were from either Northern England or Ireland. The long A, (is it called a Broad A) is only used in Southern England, and I think I've read in Melvyn Bragg's History of English that it originated in the cockney (working class London) dialect. Does anyone know any more about this? 

The most obvious attempts in Britain to "beautify" English are 19th Century attempts to introduce French words for culinary instruments, cuisine etc. hence words like cuisine (which Americans use too, don't they?) courgette instead  of zuchinni, aubergine instead of eggplant.

Doesn't the debate (fist pounding argument) in England about the beautification of English go back to the 16thC., when the construction of new words from classical roots was considered by some to be a source of romanisation? Perhaps there was a conscious effort in the new world colonies to eschew these developments. Also, English people often remark that the Irish accent is much closer than their own to the American. Then they launch into a twangy trans-Atlantic verse of ''House of the Rising Sun'' (recorded by an English band) and spill beer over their shoes.--[[User:Shtove|Shtove]] 21:08, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

It can be just a regional thing---*all* sources and *all* dictionaries say these words are Americanisms.

I'm going to change the sentence to "parts of the Midwest and West" instead.  Is there any reason for the original language?

== Dialect development on the Eastern Seaboard ==

:''Remarks by [[User:Cwalenta]]'':

OK - I have been attempting to edit the article on American English. Essentially the article argues that the greater range of accents in the eastern US vis-a-vis the western US is due to imitation of prestidgous forms of British English. While I acknowledge that there are MANY facotrs influencing the development of regional accents, the single greatest cause of language divergence is isolation. I specifically discount the imitation of British prestidgous British pronounciation because as little as 50 years after Jamestown, people begin to remark about colonial accents and the like and by 1776 there is clearly an 'American' accent.

If you take 20 people who speak English, split them into two groups and continue to isolate those two groups for 1000 years, odds are their progeny will speak two different languages. Essentially only two developments and the general increase in literacy have changed the pace of language divergence. The first was the printing press which standardized lexicon and syntax. The second was modern media, which was essentially the radio but of course the television cannot be ignored. This invention permits people to actually listen to a 'standard' form of the language over distances that in pre-industrial eras used to be isolated from each other. The longer any given area is in isolation the more language divergence you will see. In medieval times, isolation was much more common and we see this effect in the modern forms of English as spoken on the British isles. Considering the size of the UK its difficult to imagine how such language divergence could occur until you consider the length of time these areas were isolated from each other (really, people didn't travel like they do today, there is no interstate!) before the advent of the printing press and before the advent of modern media. In the case of Germany, the issue becomes even clearer: cross the Alps from Baden Wurtemburg into Switzerland and you travel from one German dialect to another that can't understand the others dialect.

Furthermore, while the word dialect is technically correct, the term accent is more descriptive in this case. The distinction between British English and American English and the various varieties really don't rise to the level of a different dialect in my view because the various forms are mutually intelligible, the spelling, syntax and grammar differences are relatively insignificant.

Nevertheless I have attempted to edit this article on several occasions and it continues to be edited back. I finally logged on and created a username. I went to the edit page and it acknowledges my theory but says that it should go up for discussion first. I am not particularly familiar with this system. But really this change should be made.

:Basically, neither theory should appear without citing [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. I personally feel the explanation that Eastern Seaboard accents are distinct because of British influence to be more compelling, because frankly they ''weren't'' isolated from the rest of America; but my personal beliefs are neither here nor there. We need to find what the published sources say about it, and cite them. As for the difference between dialect and accent, it's true that "dialect" has several different meanings. The meaning you're thinking of -- largely mutually unintelligble spoken varieties that use the same standard written language -- is called "traditional dialect" by some people (J.C. Wells for example) and is more commonly used in reference to languages in Europe (not only Germany but also Britain: Yorkshire dialect, for example, means the traditional dialect that's virtually incomprehensible to everyone else; some Scottish people also refer to speaking Scots as "speaking dialect"). But the meaning of dialect that's usually intended by theoretical linguists -- especially when referring to American English -- is more like "set of idiolects sharing a large number of common features". Your accent is part of your dialect, but only the part pertaining to pronunciation/phonology. So we have to see what specific aspects of Eastern Seaboard English is being discussed. If it's only matters of phonology (non-rhoticity, "broad A", retention of the Mary/marry/merry contrast, etc.), then we can go ahead and refer to accents. But if the sources also claim that aspects of Eastern Seaboard ''vocabulary'', ''morphology'', or ''syntax'' are attributable to either British influence or isolation, then we have to say "dialect" rather than "accent". [[User:Angr]] 04:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

::Source for my theory is the "Story of English" - and actually the notion that the 13 original colonies weren't completely isolated is true, but there is still a high degree of relative isolation. When Thomas Jefferson went to Philadelphia he described the experience akin to travelling to a foreign country. In the other examples that I cite, ie. the major differences in dialect between Baden Wurtemburg and Switzerland, its difficult to say that the German speaking Swiss cantons were COMPLETELY isolated from the rest of Germany. Many people did not leave the counties that they resided in. And frankly the root cause of 'greater' language divergence being imitation of prestidgous forms of the English language as spoken in the UK doesn't really make sense because the English ships were sailing to ALL ports at ALL times and in particular as English in England was in a 'state of flux' (English has been in a state of flux since the Saxon invasion). Relative isolation of linguistic groups has caused language divergence in virtually EVERY language, including Spanish (where a variant takes on the form of a completely different language in Portuguese), French (look at the development of Provencal), difference in Italian between North and South. Long before the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin had slowly begun its drift into the various Romance languages despite the Roman roads and significant trade. So, really I have to lobbby for this change in the article to be made.

:::Well, actually the sentence "...these areas were in contact with England, and imitated prestigious varieties of British English..." is in the section on *Phonology*. But the "Regional differences" section, which is broader in scope, clearly states that "...After the Civil War, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the Eastern seaboard."  When it comes to vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, the extent of British influence on Eastern seaboard dialects is mostly negligible. But such phenomena as r-lessness and, in New England, the broad A clearly show imitation of British speech. 100 years ago many people thought that r-lessness was "correct," now most people think it's "wrong"; Franklin D. Roosevelt, for instance, was non-rhotic to his bones; r-lessness used to be the norm in, say, New York.  Yet some East Coast areas have been fully rhotic from the very beginning.  And anyway physical and social mobility in the U.S. have doubtless favored dialect leveling, much, much more than in England---we don't have "U" and "non-U" words, for example. The bottom line is that the disputed sentence can be actually misleading and should be probably downplayed a little. Just my two cents' worth (or pennyworth? ;-)...

==American Lexicon:  Red Light ==

I made a very small change to this section in the seventh paragraph, sixth sentence.  I changed the terminology from "Jump" a red light to "run" a red light.  The reason I changed this is that in all of my life I have never heard anyone refer to driving through a red light as jumping a red light.  Rather, the normal colloquial use is running a red light.  Maybe the original author lives in an area where this is said...but I have lived in the South, Midwest, Rocky Mountain West, Southwest, and West Coast of the United States and have never heard this before.  It could be an East Coast thing, but I know a ton of Easterners from DC, NYC, Boston, and Philly that have never used it either.  Just my two cents...if someone needs to change it back to jump all I ask is that someone notes what part of the country it's typically used in.  Thanks.  --[[User:Tbkflav|Tbkflav]] 03:41, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

:No doubt that ''run'' has replaced ''jump'' _in current U.S. usage_, but that's pretty irrelevant to the sentence you modified, which illustrates some American-born traffic/transportation-related words that are now used *outside of the U.S.*  ''Run'' (a red light) is not such a word (yet)---and indeed it's featured on the [[List of words having different meanings in British and American English]] (I put it there myself a couple months ago); ''jump'' is, and it's American-born too (source: [[OED]]).

== The American English vs. British English section is lacking.  ==

See '''Murphy, R., ''English Grammar In Use, 2nd Ed.,'' from Cambridge University Press, Appendix 7, "American English," pages 282, 283''', for a concise list of grammatical differences. I'd add them myself if I had the time, but I don't. Some examples:
British: The past participle of "get" is "got." (Your English has got much better.)
American: The pp is "gotten." (Your English has gotten much better.)

Americans use simple past tense in places where Brits do not, ie. "I just ate." This is not done in the U.K.. "I've just eaten," would be said. Americans might use the present perfect as well, interchangeably. 

Brits live ''in'' a street, Americans live ''on'' a street.

The source lists fourteen such differences.

I haven't seen any reference to two differences I've observed between American and British/Australian English:

1. In British/Australian English, the words "fertile" and "myrtle" do not rhyme. In American English, they do. Similarly for "missile" & possibly others.

2. Many words seem to be pronounced in American English with the accent on the first syllable, whereas in British/Australian English, the accent is on a later syllable. For exmaple, REsearch, INsurance, DISpatch

- Coming from northern England (Manchester/Lancashire area), I'd like to say that I see some similarities between "my version" of English and what's used in the US compared to standard/Oxford English I hear from people from the south of England. The use of "gotten" and "putten" are familiar ("'ave putten it back") and living "on a street" as apposed to "in a street" ("he lives on Grafton Street)... however now living abroad where they don't speak English I tend not to use such "dialect" words and try and keep to the "norms" (whatever that is). --[[User:Rdiggle|Rdiggle]] ([[User talk:Rdiggle|talk]]) 13:51, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

It's reminiscent of (but different from) the accent of Native Americans (which was parodied in the ''South Park'' episode "[[Red Man's Greed]]"). My sister lived for a while in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] and picked up the local accent--which is nothing like the Southern-influenced Texas accent of Anglos--, and when I went to visit her, I picked it up too very quickly.

== Is this really true?  ==
''Some words with simplified spellings in American English include center, color, and maneuver, which are spelled centre, colour, and manoeuvre in other forms of English.''
As far as I know theese are also clear francophone changes in the Brittish English language and not simplifications in American English. They sound very French too, colour is even a French word (correct French spelling and all). My teacher told me that the words that end with re (ex. centre) and our (ex. colour) in Brittish english are a result of the francophilia.
:Francophilia is what's responsible for the British fondness for ''-ise'' and ''-isation'' rather than the original ''-ize'' and ''-ization'' that predominates in American English. While some ''-ize'' words were borrowed from French, most were either borrowed directly from Greek or were formed new within English. ''Center'', ''color'', and ''maneuver'', on the other hand, were all borrowed directly from French, so at least ''centre'' and ''manoeuvre'' have to be viewed as the original spellings and ''center'' and ''maneuver'' as simplifications. Since the French word for "color" is ''couleur'', though, it looks like both British and American have simplified the spelling. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 17:58, 27 May 2007 (UTC)
::While both the -ise and -ize spellings have always been acceptable in Britain, when Webster pushed for the -ize ending to be the standard it was more common in both the US and Britain. Since then a shift has taken place outside the US towards the -ise ending, perhaps as a result of Francophilia. The word colour entered English from Middle French with that spelling. The spelling 'color' is another change from Webster which caught on in the US. I understand he pushed for it largely because it was the original Latin spelling. But whether you think the word should be spelt more like the original Latin or reflect its passage through Middle French is a matter of personal choice.---[[User:Potahto|Potahto]] ([[User talk:Potahto|talk]]) 15:11, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

==Dialect vs. Variety==
Is American English really a dialect of English? I might be wrong but it seems to me that British/American/Canadian/Australian/NZ etc speakers can all understand each other perfectly well (with the exception of a few words), so it is not really accurate to say that these countries speak different dialects. "Variety" might be a more appropriate term in this case.
:''Dialect'' is a funny word that means different things in different contexts. ''Variety'' is a more neutral term that's mostly used when you don't want to take a stand about whether you're talking about a separate language, a dialect, a sociolinguistic register, an idiolect, or what-have-you. That said, I do think "dialect" is not inappropriate; one common definition of dialect is a linguistic variety that has phonological, morphological, syntactic, and/or lexical properties that distinguish it from other varieties of the same language. The definition does not entail that it is difficult for a speaker of one dialect to understand a speaker of another dialect (though it doesn't rule that out either). Since American English can be distinguished from other varieties of English in its phonology and lexicon at least (and perhaps in morphology and syntax as well although no examples are springing to mind at the moment), it's fair to call it a dialect. —[[User talk:Angr|Angr]] 19:49, 22 June 2007 (UTC)
:I feel that the differences are far from just a few words. American English, or American for short, is very different from the 'ideal' form of English, yet they are still hard to define. The reason for this is the language skills taught in schools still revolve around a refined form of classical Americanized English. I have found under intense thought of the subject that this tends to mask the fact that American is an entirely different language now with different pronoun declarations and having many words and grammatical aspects inherited from other languages. Due to scholars deadly grip onto classic Americanized English anyone studying the subject may overlook what the majority of the American public speaks and/or writes. This can be seen in classrooms all over North America whose teachers commonly understand what is written but are taught themselves that such common 'mistakes' are wrong, when in fact these common mistakes are just the evolution of the language to another form. Sadly it is these scholars who are holding onto the ideal form of classical Americanized English that define what is or isn't a separate language. -Unregistered

== Lot/strut ==

"The replacement of the lot vowel with the strut vowel in most utterances of the words was, of, from, what, everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody, because, and in some dialects want"

You must not talk to many Americans. Very rarely have I heard it pronounced "buddy". Usually just in small children who would pronounce dog as "dug", fall as "fuhl", etc. Once again, I'm not disputing that it happens in some dialects, but certainly not the majority or in all cases as you're suggesting.

The most noticeable difference I see between then and now is that back then, it was apparently quite common for Americans to distinguish between ''horse'' and ''hoarse'', between ''morning'' and ''mourning'', or between ''war'' and ''wore'', whereas nowadays it's quite rare for people to distinguish them. Also, there's no mention of [[æ-tensing]], not even before nasals (where it's most widespread today), and when discussing flapping, he claims that although the [t] is voiced in words like ''latter'' and ''putting'', they do not become homophones with ''ladder'' and ''pudding'', which they certainly are nowadays. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 08:09, 22 September 2007 (UTC)

== Standard Accent ==

Under 'Regional differences' is says General American 'is not a standard accent in the way that [[Received Pronunciation]] is in England'. Although defining the term 'standard accent' is probably a minefield, the article on [[General American]] seems to contradict this. I wanted to delete that sentence unless someone thinks otherwise... To me, General American serves exactly the same role as Received Pronunciation. [[User:Potahto|Potahto]] ([[User talk:Potahto|talk]]) 11:28, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

:The problem is that General American doesn't actually exist. The sum total of the features it's described as having make up a dialect nobody speaks, or if they do it's basically a coincidence. Received Pronunciation is a standard accent that people learn to speak ''in order to'' speak the standard dialect. That doesn't happen in the U.S.; people sometimes learn to tone down some of the most distinctive features of their own accents, but their isn't any real specific "general" standard that they end up with. [[User:Ajd|AJD]] ([[User talk:Ajd|talk]]) 15:34, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
::I disagree. General American ''does'' actually exist, but it's nowhere near as monolithic as RP (which itself is not monolithic, but that's a topic for a different talk page). For example, General American includes both varieties that merge ''cot'' and ''caught'' and varieties that keep them separate; it includes both varieties that merge ''which'' and ''witch'' and varieties that keep them separate. GenAm is an accent (not a full-fledged dialect as it concerns nothing but pronunciation), or cluster of accents, that a great many people speak, even though not all of them speak it exactly the same way. While some people do learn to tone down some of their most obvious regionalisms, a great many Americans grow up without ever having picked up any regionalisms in their pronunciation in the first place. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] <sup>[[User:Angr/If|If you've written a quality article...]]</sup> 22:14, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
:::I think I agree and disagree with both of you :). Both General American and Received Pronunciation exist in that there are people who speak in a manner that can be put under those banners, but at the same time no-one speaks any defined accent exactly (so really we all have individual accents which are just very similar to some group or other). RP includes variations as much as General American does, for example 'resource' can have a /z/ or /s/ sound in the middle. When I said they served the same role, I meant they are the accents which non-native speakers tend to try to emulate and the accents to which native speakers modulate their voice when speaking to someone from a different region. They are also the accents widely used in the media. In this sense both are standard accents. [[User:Potahto|Potahto]] ([[User talk:Potahto|talk]]) 14:02, 15 March 2008 (UTC)
::::I think at the point at which you can say "General American includes both varieties that merge ''cot'' and ''caught'' and varieties that keep them separate", that's basically tantamount to saying that there is no General American accent. The presence or absence of the ''cot''-''caught'' merger is the principal criterion on which American accents are organized, and it has structural implications for the rest of the vowel system. Really I think it's that there are a lot of dialectological criteria which American English speakers are sociologically sensitive to, but there are a lot that they're not. And as long as you don't have any of the stigmatized features, you sound "standard" enough for people to describe you as "General American", regardless of all the other features of your accent.

As we've said above, General American ''isn't'' an accent; at best, it's a collection of different accents all of which share some features and lack others. Is the same true of RP? If not, then that's a principled difference between the role of RP and so-called General American. [[User:Ajd|AJD]] ([[User talk:Ajd|talk]]) 14:34, 16 March 2008 (UTC)
::::::::::Yes, the same can be said of RP. For example, there are at least two pronunciations of 'poor' that are considered RP, and they represent major phonological differences within RP. I would argue the same can be said of any accent. Given a group of people who might be labelled as speaking with a given accent, one can find many variations within that group. Someone can be recognised as a General American speaker verses Southern or Bostonian almost instantly, but recognising a sub-group of these may take some time (depending on what vocabulary is used). If the differences within General American were ''significantly'' greater than other accents we would almost certain have found labels for them. [[User:Potahto|Potahto]] ([[User talk:Potahto|talk]]) 12:28, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::How do the two pronunciations of ''poor'' represent major phonological differences within RP, rather than just variability in a single word? Honest question.
:::::::::::Also: of course there are differences between speakers of a single accent, but the accent is defined in terms of overall phonological structure and the sound changes which are in progress in the community. Also, from the way [[User:Angr|Angr]] describes General American, it seems to me that a person can be a General American speaker ''at the same time as'' also being a Southern or Bostonian speaker, provided the characteristic features of the Southern or Boston accent aren't very extreme. For instance, you'd probably describe me as sounding like a General American speaker, but there's no question that I have a Boston phonology, even though I'm [[rhotic]]: I merge ''cot'' and ''caught'' as a rounded vowel, distinguish ''marry'', ''merry'', and ''Mary'', distinguish ''father'' and ''bother'', have a nasal short-''a'' system, and so on. Someone from Cleveland whose [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] isn't very advanced might also be describable as "General American" despite differing from me on all those criteria I mentioned. These aren't minor differences; they're the principal criteria on which dialects of American English are categorized. So it seems the description "General American" has almost no phonological content, and it can overlap with many different regional dialects.

::::::::::::With the 'poor' example (ho ho) I meant the difference between /ʊə/ and /ɔː/ in words that commonly end in '-oor' or '-our' for example, like 'tour'. As for who might be considered a General American speaker, the [[General American]] page says
:::::::::::::''Within American English, General American and accents approximating it are contrasted with Southern American English, several Northeastern accents, and other distinct regional accents and social group accents like African American Vernacular English.''
::::::::::::I have something similar in mind, so your accent could lie inside or outside that camp depending on which it is closer to --- we both agree the definitions involved are not rock solid. Although (my opinion is that) it's more widespread in the US than RP is in the UK, it's not a general term for any accent in American English. It's sometimes viewed as preferable to other American accents, is that which is taught in American accent reduction classes and the most common accent in the media. The phonological variation within it is of the same order of that in RP. So, they are essential of the same nature. [[User:Potahto|Potahto]] ([[User talk:Potahto|talk]]) 17:13, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
Another phonological difference within RP is the presence or absence of "happY tensing."  RP and GenAm have a lot of things in common--they are the accents usually taught to learners of "British" and "American" English, and neither of them is a "regional accent" (anymore).  However, GenAm is not really a social accent in the U.S. the way RP is in England--this is a major difference.  AJD--if you don't have the father-bother merger, and if you maintain the Mary-merry-marry distinction, then you can't be considered a GenAm speaker by any stretch of the imagination ;)  '''<font color="SteelBlue"><big><span style="font-family:eras demi itc">Jack</span></big></font>'''<sup>([[User:JackLumber|Lumber]])</sup> 19:47, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

:::Well, I'm no expert, but I do have my ears :-)  I am a native Englishman.  English as spoken by most Americans sounds to me like a bit of a 'blend' of two of our native accents.  The rhotic pronunciation and the general 'position' in which an American holds his mouth whilst speaking is very similar to a mild English 'West Country' accent.  This is milder than the accent spoken in Cornwall and Devon, and mainly found within an area enclosed by, say, Bristol, Swindon, Salisbury, Weymouth and Taunton.  The 'Phraseing' and 'rythym' of American speech does owe a lot to Southern Irish accents.  I would say from an area centred roughly on County Waterford.  Also...Is it just me, or is the American accent changing?  If I watch old American war movies and Westerns, and compare them with more modern stuff (i.e. CSI / ER / Friends / House (''yes, I know he is :-'') / Hill Street Blues etc) the accent definitely seems to have become less intense and 'melodramatic', and more 'laid back' over the years.[[Special:Contributions/160.84.254.241|160.84.254.241]] ([[User talk:160.84.254.241|talk]]) 07:47, 15 October 2008 (UTC)

:::::Before WWII, many actors and actresses (like Katherine Hepburn) would use non-rhotic pronunciation, which made them sound more English.

After a while, though, non-rhotic accents became stigmatized in America, while rhotic accents became stigmatized in England (I'm not sure when exactly that started).  So if anything, Americans (including actors, of course) now sound more distinct from you guys, and more ourselves.  Maybe you associate rhoticity with being "laid back".

::Thanks for that.  I'm not sure that I know what you mean by rhotic accents being 'stigmatised' in the UK.  I think that (to the English ear) a rhotic accent suggests a more 'rural' rather than 'urban' ancestry, but it doesn't suggest stupidity, or (Norfolk aside) that the person should really be sat on a verandah playing a banjo.  It also doesn't apply to Americans, as we are attuned to expecting a rhotic sound from most of you as standard.  As to the 'laid back' aspect: Well, I think it has to do with the slower phrasing and longer vowels.  I speak with a non-rhotic accent; In fact I am from near Manchester, so I omit most of the rest of the alphabet as well.  (If you google an interview with one of the brothers from the band 'Oasis' you will see what I mean).  If I try to fake a rhotic accent I have to speak much more slowly, and change the shape of my mouth so that the sound begins somewhere lower and further back than my normal lazy 'between the teeth' speech.  If I try to fake an American accent, it is much easier if I pick Noo Yoik or something similar, otherwise the muscles in my jaw ache after a while:-) Anyway; Best Wishes from jolly old Blighty [[Special:Contributions/160.84.254.241|160.84.254.241]] ([[User talk:160.84.254.241|talk]]) 07:36, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

:::::I thought "stigmatized" might be too harsh a word.  I'm sure you guys see rhotic speech as much more "normal" and English.  I'm American and I actually like to hear the few non-rhotic accents we have left here, like the Boston accent and the NYC accent.  But a lot of people think they sound stupid, which of course, they don't.  There is nothing inherently stupid about the vowels that people from those places use.  A vowel can't be stupid.  What's really funny is that many of us love to hear you guys speak with non-rhoticity, but hate it when New Yorkers and/or Bostonites do the same thing.  I'm sure you would have a much easier time doing a New York accent or a Boston accent than other American accents.  But I can't do a very good West Country accent, though, even though I am a rhotic speaker, so I guess that theory doesn't work both ways:).  I'm much better at doing a South-East English accent or a London accent, which are both non-rhotic!  It might be because those are the accents that Americans most commonly hear.  Even [[Gordon Ramsay]] has that type of accent, and he's from Scotland!  We rarely ever hear Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish, northern English, or anything besides South-East English accents.  I think those are the accents we most associate with England, which would also explain why we always imitate those accents when told to do an English accent (as opposed to a Manchester accent or something).  However, I do like hearing those northern English accents (I know there's more than one) when I get a chance.  Sometimes I'll hear them on ''[[You Are What You Eat]]'' and ''[[How Clean is Your House?]]'' on [[BBC America]].  Most of the time I can't pinpoint exactly where the northern accents come from, but I usually can tell that they're northern, or at least not from the South-East.  What gives them away is usually the vowel they use in words like ''strut'', which is the same as the vowel they use in ''foot'', the vowel they use in ''bath'', which often sounds the same as the one in ''trap'', except it might be a bit longer, and sometimes the vowels they use in ''goat'' and ''face'', which can be [[monophthong|monophthongal]] ([[Peter Kay]] has this feature).  I think the northern ones sound really wierd, but that's probably because Americans rarely get a chance to hear those accents, like I said before.  In reality, we don't speak any slower than you guys.  I think that's just something that varies from person to person in both countries.  I'm not offended at all; I'm just letting you know.  I could teach you how to do my Midland American accent; it's really easy :). [[User:Thegryseone|Thegryseone]] ([[User talk:Thegryseone|talk]]) 20:49, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

== Broad A in American Speech ==

The article says,

<blockquote>
The shift of /æ/ to /ɑ/ (the so-called "broad A") before /f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/ alone or preceded by a homorganic nasal. This is the difference between the British Received Pronunciation and American pronunciation of bath and dance. In the United States, only eastern New England speakers took up this modification, although even there it is becoming increasingly rare.
</blockquote>

I wonder whether the shift was from /æ/ to /ɑ/ or in the other direction, or whether it was a shift at all. My impression has been that /ɑ/ came in with non-rhotic R in the late 17th Century with the arrival of a wave of rich royalists from Southern England, who became the social elite in the colonies that became our Eastern States.  That would make it an overlay, not a shift, wouldn't it?

In any event, the statement about its catching on only in eastern New England is quite incorrect.  The broad A was formerly widespread in Virginia, and still hangs on among the elderly, particularly among the upper classes, especially around Richmond.  Many Virginians of all classes  (though I've never encountered it among black Virginians) still say /tə'mɑto/.  

Broad A was formerly a feature of the speech of the Eastern elite, as exemplified by, for instance, Franklin D. Roosevelt and George Plimpton.  I suspect it's still to be found in the Hudson Valley and in Philadelphia among the old, rich families.

In Charleston, S.C., and environs, one used to find (and may still find) a variant of the broad A, flattened to /æ/ but not according to the standard American pattern.  Thus, "tomato" is /tə'mætə/, instead of General American /tə'mejdə/; "mama" is /'mæmə/ instead of GA /'mɑmə/; "palm" is /pæ:m/  instead of GA /pɑ:m/.

:Well, the shift has gone back and forth. First, it was a phonologically conditioned shift from /æ/ to {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, which maybe happened only in southern England. Then it was a sociolinguistically conditioned shift in the eastern states from /æ/ to the more prestigious {{IPA|/ɑ/}}. And now there's a sociolinguistically conditioned shift from {{IPA|/ɑ/}} back to /æ/, as the prestigiousness has shifted. And of course the sociolinguistic shifts don't necessarily apply to all words. Looking through the ''PEAS'' data for "half", "glass", and "aunt", it appears that "glass" is least likely to have broad A and "aunt" is most likely. Indeed, some people who otherwise have consistently flat A will use broad A in "aunt", probably to prevent it from being homophonous with "ant". (Garrison Keillor, for example, consistently says {{IPA|/ɑnt/}} even though Minnesota is not a broad-A accent at all. But that's probably him being speech-conscious rather than being a characteristic of his regional accent in general. I've noticed [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] using broad A in "rather" – again, probably an effect of being speech-conscious.) You're right that broad A can be found in Virginia (South Carolina too), but even when the data for ''PEAS'' was being collected it was a minority pronunciation there. The map for "half" shows 2 people out of 13 in NYC having broad A and the rest having flat A, and no one at all in the Hudson Valley or Philadelphia. In the city-by-city vowel charts of ''PEAS'', one of three people from NYC had broad A in "glass", and all three people had flat A in "half" and "aunt". The informant from Philadelphia and all three informant from the Hudson Valley had flat A in all three words. The informants from Alexandria and Winchester VA had broad A in all three words. The informants from Wicomico Church and Norfolk and both informants from Richmond had broad A in "aunt" only. The informant from Roanoke had broad A in "glass" and "aunt" but not "half". Both informants from Charleston SC had flat A in all three words, but the informant from Columbia had broad A in "half" only. The city-by-city vowel charts are based on "cultivated" speakers, most of whom went to college or at least prep school and most of whom were born in or before the 1890s. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 16:13, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

Thanks, Angr, for the info.  Are the PEAS data available on the web?

==Pier-Pure Merger in American Speech==
I've noticed that many speakers in the U.S. don't make a distinction between the words ''pier'' and ''pure''.  I just want to know if anyone else has anything to say about this. [[User:Thegryseone|Thegryseone]] ([[User talk:Thegryseone|talk]]) 04:45, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

:How have you noticed it? I mean, have people told you that they think ''pier'' and ''pure'' are pronounced the same? Or have you just heard people saying ''pure'' in a way that sounds like ''pier'' to you (or vice versa)? Phonetic/phonological differences can be subtle enough that people who don't make the distinction in the same way don't hear the difference, while people to whom the contrast is native can. I'll grant that the distinction may be subtle—for me the difference between ''pier'' and ''pure'' is basically just a difference of syllabicity: /pir/ vs. /pjɚ/. [[User:Ajd|AJD]] ([[User talk:Ajd|talk]]) 04:18, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

::I think it's also a matter of how quickly someone is speaking. If you ask me how to pronounce ''pier'' and ''pure'', it would be obvious that I pronounce them differently. However, if I'm speaking fast, it might not be as easy to distinguish in speech.  The same thing happens with ''pin'' and ''pen''.  In my mind, these words are clearly pronounced differently, but when someone is speaking quickly, the distinction may not be detectable or they may merge.  I have not read about a pier-pure merger, though. [[User:Kman543210|Kman543210]] ([[User talk:Kman543210|talk]]) 04:23, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

What I meant is that ''I'' often have a difficult time pronouncing the sound in words like ''pure'', and that sometimes it comes out sounding just like ''pier''. [[User:Thegryseone|Thegryseone]] ([[User talk:Thegryseone|talk]]) 16:58, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

==Val and vowel, bull and bowl==
I also notice that there is often no distinction between ''Val'' and ''vowel'' in American English, but this is much more understandable, because vowels before a word-final /l/ nearly always get screwed up, and because /aʊ/ often gets fronted to /æʊ/.  Many speakers don't distinguish between ''bull'' and ''bowl'' either, but I think people have commented on that before.  [[User:Thegryseone|Thegryseone]] ([[User talk:Thegryseone|talk]]) 19:53, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

:I know that the val/vowel merger is in progress in Philadelphia at least; I wouldn't be surprised if it's found to some degree in other [[Midland American English|Midland]] communities. I've heard of the bull/bowl merger, but I don't know what region it's associated with. But in communities with heavy [[l-vocalization]], vowel mergers before /l/ are extremely likely in the long run. [[User:Ajd|AJD]] ([[User talk:Ajd|talk]]) 20:04, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

Well I'm a young person from the Midland, and I have both of those mergers, but I don't think I have any l-vocalization.  I don't know how someone could possibly distinguish between ''bull'' and ''bowl''.  
I just find it extremely interesting how many mergers are going on right now. [[User:Thegryseone|Thegryseone]] ([[User talk:Thegryseone|talk]]) 20:15, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
:Huh. My ''bull'' and ''bowl'' are nowhere near each other, and I have trouble imagining them sounding the same. I should say, though, that my pronunciation of ''bull'' hardly has any vowel in it at all; it's practically {{IPA|[bl̩]}} with a syllabic L. (Similarly for ''full'' and ''pull''.) —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 20:36, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

Well, it's possible that I have a near-merger, and they just sound the same to my ears, or maybe I just have bad hearing.  My "syllabic L" (at the end of words like ''bottle'', etc.) seems to be pretty much a shortened, unstressed version of my merged ''bull'' and ''bowl'' vowel.

:Re: val/vowel.  From [[Webster's Third]] (1961), Guide to Pronunciation (page 38a, IPA notation is mine):
<blockquote>
:Although we do not show the possibility in vocabulary pronunciations, with some speakers who have [æ] as the first element of their diphthong in ''loud'', the sequence of sounds that we transcribe /æl/ in some words and /aʊl/ in others, depending on the spelling, is probably actually /aʊl/ in both classes. Such pairs as ''Al : owl'', ''Cal : cowl'', ''Hal : howel'', ''Halley : Howley'', ''Alice Ide : owl aside'' are sometimes identical (the second member of the /l/-final pairs is subject to the intrusion of a parasitic [ə] sound after the /ʊ/, the first is not). The variety of /l/ used by most Americans outside the South in words such as those cited is known as the dark variety, in which the back of the tongue is in a position for [ʊ] or a neighboring vowel. Since the back of the tongue must reach this position before the tip makes the contact for the articulation of an /l/, the intrusion of a [ʊ] or of a closely related vowel sound seems highly probable.
</blockquote>
