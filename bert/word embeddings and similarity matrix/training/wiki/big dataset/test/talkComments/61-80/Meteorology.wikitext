== [[Weather forecasting]] vs. [[Meteorology]]? ==
I'm having a hard time understanding what the difference is between this article and [[Weather forecasting]], which appears to be about the same subject.  Is there some reason these are two separate articles with a fair amount of duplicated content?  If so, what is it?  If not, should these articles be merged? -- [[User:Foogod|Foogod]] 21:24, 30 December 2005 (UTC)


:''Meteorology'' is the study...''Weather forecasting'' is the application.
::[[User:Hard Raspy Sci|Hard Raspy Sci]] 08:56, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
:::P.S. No merge pleeze, my forecast is...this article is nowhere near completion, and is likely to expand...

Ok, it seems there's some consensus that they should be separate articles, so I won't propose a merge, but the distinction as things are written still seems a bit fuzzy to me (I certainly understand the difference between a science and its application, but I was noting that both articles seemed to talk about both aspects, which is why it was confusing that there's two articles.  Hopefully this can be improved).  -- [[User:Foogod|Foogod]] 23:40, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

:I concur that they should remain separate articles --though improvements to the articles should be made. 
:It raises an issue with the sharp, distinct division of atmospheric sciences to physics and chemistry; both are subdivisions of meteorology (and climatology) and are not fundamentally separate. There is overlap, the division to physics or chemistry refers to the respective principles in isolation. So they are distinguishable but the complexity and subtleties are poorly reflected on Wikipedia. The classic division of meteorology refers not to the field of science, rather: research and forecasting (operational). 
:So, weather forecasting is meteorology (yes, the application of, but not a separate entity), as are atmospheric physics and chemistry, they're simply arbitrary subdivisions. Even climatology isn't quite reflected well on here, as it is just meteorological principles over a set time period (usually but not necessarily longer term), tending more towards statistical methods. As presented now the articles seem to mistake weather and climate for meteorology and climatology, they aren't quite equivalent. [[User:Evolauxia|Evolauxia]] 08:26, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
::I tend to agree both articles need work, even though this one was rated as a "B" class article after peer review.  Each subject in their own right contains loads of information, as such each should be separate.  Of course overlapping will occur, hopefully not too much... --[[User:Hard Raspy Sci|Hard Raspy Sci]] 01:26, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

==New page, plus troughs and ridges==
I've recently created the page [[Block (meteorology)]]. I'm not sure where the best place to put it in this article is, so feel free to find a spot for it, and also to edit it with more information, etc. Also, we could probably use more information for [[Ridge (meteorology)]] and [[Trough (meteorology)]] if anyone can think of some good stuff to put on there.

==Why no mention of atmospheric pollution dispersion modeling?==

Many of the worldwide leading scientists in the fields of atmospheric air pollution dispersion modeling and air quality modeling are meteorologists and they are also members of the [[American Meteorological Society]].  In their applied meteorology programs, many universities worldwide teach undergraduate and postgraduate courses in air pollution dispersion modeling.  Why is this subject not even mentioned in this article? - [[User:Mbeychok|mbeychok]] 23:25, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

:Well there is a page on this: [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]] which is in the meterology category. I don't think it is appropriate to include all meteorology related topics in this article. I suppose there could be a See also section including this though. --[[User:NHSavage|NHSavage]] 23:46, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

::NHSavage, thank you for your response.  I know about [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling]] because I wrote it about a week ago and I linked it to the meteorology category. However, that does'nt really answer my question.  Since meteorologists play a leading role in the important field of air pollution dispersion modeling, don't you think its worth discussing that fact in this article on meteorology?  I mean more than just a "See also" link or just an "External" link to some website. - [[User:Mbeychok|mbeychok]] 01:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

:::I've glanced at the ''ADM'' article and it looks ok so far, however the first thing I see is Gaussian mathematics as part of the article.  Don't worry, thats not a problem,  its just says--Physics.  Not that I mind one way or another, but the article might steer more in the direction of [[atmospheric physics]] or [[atmospheric science]].  '''And''' those articles do need help (one may still be a stub).  Go ahead, and incorporate a section or into an appropriate section in [[meteorology]] or all three... --[[User:Hard Raspy Sci|Hard Raspy Sci]] 04:27, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

== Institutions of meteorology/atmospheric science ==

::On second thoughts - perhaps a link to [[:Category:Meteorological institutions and stations]] would be better? It is far more comprehensive.

It looks like there are alot of sections already, there really isn't that much writing beyond the first three parts.  I created the '''Links to other keywords in meteorology''' box (years ago) with the intention that it would ultimately disappear by acting as a reference of sorts, and it was hoped that those keywords would get spread out into the entire article (if possible).

Can someone write a section on meteo-sensitivity in people?

This section is substantial.  But there is also a separate article bearing that same title which is relatively small.

</blockquote>
A critique of people showing weather forecasts ("weatherpersons") and the hiring practices of the media is inappropriate for this article for several reasons. First, there is the blog issue; it is the opinion of one or two people, not necessarily an authoritative source or a person knowledgeable in the field, and definitely not peer-reviewed. Second, it gives the "Meteorologists" section a decidedly negative POV towards weather persons. Third and lastly, this is an article about meteorology and meteorologists, not about television reporters ''who may or not even be'' meteorologists. 

We probably need an article [[weatherperson]] or [[weather reporter]]; this sort of critical passage would be much more appropriate there.-<b>[[User:Runningonbrains|<span style="color:#000">Running</span><font color="blue">On</font><font color="green">Brains</font>]]<sup>([[User talk:Runningonbrains|talk]])</sup></b> 20:37, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

== Not just the atmosphere ==

<blockquote>
'''Meteorology''' is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics, with a major focus on weather forecasting.
</blockquote>

I was reading for a while before the lead first mentions the ocean, and then only in the context of a coupled system, as opposed to the ocean having an active role in weather phenomena. 

Previously, it ''had'' mentioned [[meteorological phenomena]], which, if you dig into it, ''does'' includes the topic [[storm surge]].

It might be helpful to establish that weather is mostly ''but not exclusively'' atmospheric in the early going. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 23:40, 16 March 2019 (UTC)

:Perhaps the way in is to mention marine safety as an important aspect of weather forecasting, which besides the spring planting season, was maybe ''the'' original driving force behind meteorology in the first place. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 23:42, 16 March 2019 (UTC)

:Well, I went ahead and added the following sentence: "An important domain of weather forecasting is [[marine weather forecasting]] as it relates to maritime and coastal safety, in which weather effects also include atmospheric interactions with large bodies of water." Feel free to do better. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 23:50, 16 March 2019 (UTC)

::Okay, now I'm getting pedantic, but does a large shower of volcanic ash constitute a weather event? I was once in the corner of the [[Mount St Helens]] ash dump. I didn't regard that as weather at the time. Nor would I regard [[exploding whale]]s as weather, either. But to the degree that volcanic ash affects [[insolation]], I ''would'' regard it as a weather effect. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 23:58, 16 March 2019 (UTC)
{{od}}
This useful discussion highlights the additional work we must do across a range of articles to distinguish between [[climate]] and [[weather]] and explain how they interact.   All weather is a product of the [[climate system]], which is made of up of five interacting parts and has several [[biogeochemical]] process moving through them.  [[Climate change]] can happen in response to "internal variation" or "external forcing", where the internal/external refers to the parts of the climate system.  One of those parts is the [[Lithosphere]].  Climatologists consider the origins of [[Volcanism]] to be deeper than that, so Mt St Helens would be considered an "external forcing".  Certainly during a period of ash fall the US National Weather Service would include that hazard and air quality in general in their reporting, but that doesn't make those phenomena ''weather'' per se.  Volcanic ash (suspended) is mostly at [[Climate change#Volcanism]] (which is probably going to be part of a pending [[WP:CONSPLIT|content split]] when we create a new article on "climate forcings" or maybe "external climate forcings".  See also [[Earth's energy budget]] and [[Climate change feedback]].   And so several of the things you might be describing are certainly influencing the <ins>long term average</ins> weather, and so are discussed under ''climate''.  They are relevant to this article for explaining the climate ''context'' in which weather happens, but they aren't short term weather in themselves.

==Are Suggestions Encyclopedic?==

Should predictions and suggestions be in this article? --[[User:SEWilco|SEWilco]] 03:15, 10 Sep 2003 (UTC)

: With model output approaching oberservational data (e.g. from satellite soundings) in resolution, the sheer size of the datasets means that data mining and data management will become equally important considerations in meteorological computing. In light of the decrease in density of surface and rawinsonde observations, new algorithms have to be developed to extract similarly accurate information from satellite data, for example about cloud type and distribution. Data management will become more global in nature, with some central archives storing a large number of numerical experiments from various institutions. This data needs to have a sufficient amount of metadata attached and can then be conveniently retrieved by a WWW interface from anywhere. These new archives will alleviate the important task of comparing experiments conducted with different models, which is instrumental for their further improvement. Also, grid computing may be a interesting way to harness the power of meteorological supercomputers more effectively. Of course, international cooperation is nothing unusual in modelling, but grid computing might automate the process of running a model where the right amount of computing resources are currently available and leave scientists more time for analyzing the results.

: Meteorological instrumentation that is used at the surface or in airplanes also has room for improvement. Radar and Lidar show precipitation and clouds by their effects on emitted monospectral electromagnetic waves. If radar measurements can be used to accurately determine the amount of precipitation (which as of now is only possible with rain gauges), this would be beneficial for numerical weather prediction. Lidar can be used to study clouds that are so thin that they cannot be seen by the naked eye such as certain types of cirrus filaments. The high-altitude clouds that can form from contrails may well be the key to understanding the effect of the increasing amount of air travel on global warming. 

: Finally, meteorologists must educate the public more about weather and climate in general. Scientifically accurate and understandable information about topics like the ozone hole, global warming, the effects of rainforest deforestation, or sea level rise must be disseminated and misinformation by industry lobbyists be countered. Particularly in Europe, which may see an increase in extreme weather events as it already has in the 1990s, the population must be educated to pay closer attention to severe weather warnings or information about other detrimental health factors such as high tropospheric ozone concentration or high levels of UV radiation. Similarly, a better infrastructure to deal with natural desasters must be developed akin to similar services in the US. It is clear that political decisionmakers in Europe will rely on scientific assessment to validate the necessity for such spending.

== talking to myself ==

I think this paragraph is controversial:

<blockquote>In the 1960s, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first understood by Edward Lorenz, founding the field of chaos theory. The mathematical advances achieved here later filtered back to meteorology and made it possible to describe the limits of predictability inherent in atmospheric modelling. This is known as the butterfly effect, because the growth of disturbances over time means that even one as minute as the flapping of a butterfly's wings could much later cause a large disturbance to form somewhere else.</blockquote>

There are other articles on this wiki that state the belief of some that a complete model of the atmosphere can be described with diff eqs, but the complexity is beyond our means for the time being. Different than "inherent unpredictability".--[[User:Demonburrito|demonburrito]] 11:13, 11 August 2005 (UTC)


:Yes, differential equations are solved numerically in weather forecasting models. However, no matter how complete and accurate the model is, uncertainty in the representation of the initial state of the atmosphere will always grow and lead to forecast errors. This is true of all chaotic systems, of which the atmosphere has been proven to be a good example. Therefore I don't think that the fact that the "atmosphere can be described by diff eqs" and stating that it is  "inherent unpredictability" are contradicting each other.   (see [[Chaos theory]]) [[User:Peterlean|PeterLean]] 10:40, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:Demonburrito; I've reinserted the bit about the chaotic nature of the atmosphere because I believe that it is one of the most important aspects of atmospheric bahaviour for weather forecasting. If you feel that this theory is controversial then have a look at:

:http://wwwt.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/ens/info/ens_detbak.html
:-most of the major operational forecasting centers are beginning to use ensemble forecasts to take account of the uncertainty in the forecasts arising due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.

The popular books on chaos theory (like Gleick's "Chaos") in the late 80s had a big impact on my thinking, and I personally feel that time may demonstrate Lorenz to be correct as theoretical math progresses. However, having spent some time chatting on [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia/#mathematics], I was unable to find a consensus on this issue. I worry that the paragraph may not be encyclopedic. Perhaps we can split the difference and mention chaos theory's role in the advent of ensemble forecasting, and provide a link to [[chaos theory]]?

:::Chaos theory gives an unpredictable mathematical solution to a system, where the mathematical solution is unpredictable with respect to some exactness, but it does not mean that every solution is entirely unpredictable, just ''inherently'' so.

== Trimming ==

consider: 
<blockquote>Specific: Large scale wind mapping
The direction, strength, and variability of winds over various parts of the earth have been of great interest for a long time. The first large-scale wind mapping efforts were done to aid sailors who depended on winds to power their ships. In the last four decades a considerable amount of work has been done to map winds which might be used to generate power.
<br/>

It is difficult to map the wind because it is a chaotic system. Weather forecasting is extremely difficult to do accurately for more than a few days. However, statistical methods can be used to predict general expectations of wind. Resolution can be low, e.g. maps of an entire continent; or high, where a specific site is assesed. High resolution maps are used for example to asses the viability of a site for wind turbines.
<br/>

The inputs to the mapping process are: measured wind data and topography, and possibly other meteorological data which might relate to seasonal variation, pressure, and humidity. Humidity and temperature affect the density of the air, and thus the power produced from a given wind speed. Proximity of the sea has diurnal and seasonal effects on wind patterns. The 'WAsP' model uses a simple algorithm to predict wind over simple topography. It does not solve the Navier-Stokes equations which, in principle, give the correct answers to how the speed and direction of wind changes as it flows over 'complex' terrain.
<br/>

A typical process for a large-scale wind map would take the wind data, and separate it into groups based on direction and speed. For each group, the wind is simulated using computer-based models, and the result is recorded. The results for each group are then averaged according to the frequency of that speed and direction 'bucket', giving the average wind over an area. This is only indicative, and before a wind farm is constructed, detailed local measurements are essential.
<br/>

For small areas, the Navier-Stokes equations can be solved with some success, atechnique employed more often as computer power grows to match the task. With this method, the volume of air around the site of interest is cut into discrete chunks. Each is considered independently, like a pixel of a computer display. Each chunk interacts with its neighbours according to their pressure (although this can be neglected), and wind speeds. The smaller the chunk sizes, the closer the result is to reality, although large divergence is not uncommon. These models are extremely computationally expensive to run.
<br/>

'Simple' terrain can be modelled using simple mass balance: if there is a hill in the way, the wind is accelerated. This is the Bernoulli Effect, and the core of the WAsP model.
<br/>

Wind is powered by a temperature differential. It is slowed by obstructions and is generally stronger at high altitudes. Plains have high winds because they have few obstructions. Mountain passes have high winds mostly because they funnel high-altitude winds. Some passes have winds powered by a temperature differential between the sides of the ridges. Coastal areas have high winds because water has few obstructions and because of the temperature difference between the land and the sea. Off-shore also generally has high winds for the same reasons.
</blockquote>

I think this is all fine work, but I also think that this is too specific to be included in the general meteorology article. I'm quoting it in entirety to preserve it on the talk page. --[[User:Demonburrito|demonburrito]] 03:56, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

== Relevancy of chaos theory for weather science ==

::The term 'inherent unpredictability' doesn't appear on the [[chaos theory]] page and strikes me as an oversimplification which might leave readers with wrong impressions.--[[User:Demonburrito|demonburrito]] 03:36, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

I agree that the term 'inherent unpredictability' is inappropriate for any form of dynamics that is 'chaotic' in character. Somewhat closer would be: 'inherent decay of predictability'. In the case of a chaotic system (''chaotic'' in the specific technical sense of ''chaos theory''), the reliability of even the best attempt at forecast drops exponentially with the time span of the forecast. A weather forecast 3 days into the future is pretty likely to be right on the mark, these days. The likelyhood of a forecast 6 days into the future being right is much smaller than half the odds of the 3-day ahead forecast being correct. 

In the article it is stated: "the growth of disturbances over time means that even one as minute as the flapping of a butterfly's wings could much later cause a large disturbance to form somewhere else." That statement is simply wrong, the butterfly image is a metaphor, it is simply wrong to take it literally. --[[User:Cleon Teunissen|Cleon Teunissen]] | [[User talk:Cleon_Teunissen|Talk]] 21:06, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

: Errm, well, hold on. The butterflys wing stuff is probably widely misunderstood, but isn't wrong. Any disturbance, even one far smaller than a butterflys wing, would eventually grown to the extent that different realisations (were that possible: it certainly is in a model) would be completely different. The error is in assuming that butterflys wings cause tornadoes in some direct sense, which is wrong. [[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 14:21:57, 2005-08-20 (UTC).

:: In a sense one can say that the weather 14 days ahead being unpredictable is a consequence of a gazillion disturbances, sometimes reinforcing each other, sometimes annihilating each other. A truly ''exhaustive'' equation of motion would have to take each drop of a leaf into account, for a leaf still being attached to the tree or the leaf being torn off makes (theoretically) a difference, etc. etc. 

::I see a twofold wrongness in taking the metaphor of the 'butterfly flapping its wings' literally. The one you mention, and the following: that an exhaustive equation of motion would have to take a gazillion disturbances into account ''simultaneously'', each disturbance contributing on average one gazillionth to the decay of predictability. Each individual disturbance is rapidly diluted into oblivion in the process. The principle characteristic of systems that are categorized as 'chaotic systems' is that tracing cause-effect connections becomes exponentially harder to achieve with increasing time span. The path of any large development, such as a hurricane, is determined by innumerable tiny individual contributions. --[[User:Cleon Teunissen|Cleon Teunissen]] | [[User talk:Cleon_Teunissen|Talk]] 10:55, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I agree entirely with William Connolley's comments. It's true that a perfect forecast would require a perfect model along with perfect initial conditions which would need to include all of the many small disturbance occuring. However, even just one small disturbance not included in the initial conditions can (if the conditions are unstable and allow perturbations to grow) eventually lead to a total loss of predictability. It seems probable that often a single butterfly flapping its wings would make no difference to a forecast at all in the long run if the conditions are such that the disturbance simply decays, but in unstable conditions it can grow and lead to a total loss of predictability. --[[User:Peterlean|PeterLean]] 16:32, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
