==Constrained writing==

I've removed the following:

:''Writing that blends meaning and orthography is called [[constrained writing]].''

Surely writing that belnds meaning and orthography is, um, ''meaningful writing''. Constrained writing can be many things, but it tends to be a bit more constrained than "it must make sense". --[[User:Camembert|Camembert]]

==United ''Bible'' Society==

Surely that should be United ''Bible'' Society? Can someone who has the book please check? -- mpt, 2003-06-04

==Orthography vs. Writing system==

What is the principled distinction between this article and [[writing system]]? Most of this article could be transplanted into the latter. --[[User:Ryguasu|Ryguasu]] 00:16 27 Jun 2003 (UTC)

== History ==

A bit on the history of orthography wouldn't hurt if anybody has the required knowledge. -- [[User:82.82.146.239|82.82.146.239]] 22:37, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Observation ==

The rule "i before e except after c" is wrong. "Feign" clearly is an exception. How can it be an orthagraphic rule if orthography means "how to write correctly"? Surely this is not an orthographic rule. [[User:Rintrah|Rintrah]] 13:09, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

It's not ''wrong;'' that's just a truncated version. "''I'' before ''e'' except after ''c'' and when sounding like ''a'' as in ''neighbor'' or ''weigh...''" I'm pretty sure that's not the end of the rhyme, either. Besides, English is famous for nothing if not exceptions. [[User:Archer884|J.M. Archer]] ([[User talk:Archer884|talk]]) 19:40, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

Perhaps, but that doesn't explain words such as "protein". 23:44, 5 May 2010 (UTC)~

:As a rule of thumb, "i before e except after c" is quite good. An exception is ''weird''. English has many irregular spellings; only a tiny percentage of "i,e" words do not conform. I haven't worked out the precise [[coefficient of determination]], but its [[goodness of fit]] must be pretty high. Any one who fancies proposing a pithy generalisation with fewer inadequacies is welcome to have a go.

::: According to [[John C. Wells|Wells]]'s ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'' it is correct to pronounce ''protein'' with either two or three syllables in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]. And according to my copy of ''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary'' this is also the case in American English. <small>[[Wikipedia:WikiLove|Love]]</small>&nbsp;—[[:commons:User:LiliCharlie|LiliCharlie]]&nbsp;<small>([[User talk:LiliCharlie|talk]])</small> 19:58, 9 December 2017 (UTC)

== German "efficiency" ==

Quoting the spelling ''Tzschaetzsch'' as an example for German orthography is not very good. No German in their right mind would write the name in this way. Normally, it would be spelled ''Tschätsch''. In normal German orthography "tz" on the beginning on a word isn't valid, as well as "tz" before "sch". Moreover, "ae" is never written vor umlaut-a, instead the letter "ä" is used. Such crazy spellings only occur in names derived from Slavic languages and also then they're very seldom. Furthermore, "Tschätsch" is not a personal name in German, but a (seldom) surname. [[User:62.46.180.91|62.46.180.91]]

==Defectiveness==
I guess that English is defective because "th" doesn't differ between {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[θ]}}, but how is Italian and Arabian orthography defective? Maybe the article would need a short explanation? [[User:Wakuran|惑乱 分からん]] 10:39, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

:There are many many other reasons why English spelling is defective (why, after all, do we write defective and not defektiv?). Arabic is defective inasmuch as short vowels are not normally represented&mdash;some sounds can also be represented in more than one way (like the /n/ at the end of shukran, which is not written with the normal sign for /n/).  And that's just Modern Standard Arabic&mdash;the everyday colloquial forms are barely even represented in writing.  I'm less sure about Italian, though I'm sure an example will come to me.  Perfectly phonemic alphabets are very rare. [[User:Garik|garik]] 12:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
::Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought that a defective orthography had sounds it couldn't mark in writing... [[User:Wakuran|惑乱 分からん]] 13:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
:::I wouldn't have said so: to me a defective orthography is one where either there are distinctions that can't be represented in writing ''or'' where there are obsolete or redundant letters (basically where the one-letter-per-phoneme system breaks down)  I'm not an orthography experts, however, so I may be misusing a term that has a narrower scope among specialists. [[User:Garik|garik]] 13:21, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
::::Yes, Arabic is the text-book case of a defective orthography, because of the lack of vowels. Even long vowels - since they are written by consonants, it's not apparent that a vowel is intended without a knowledge of the language. That Arabic doesn't ''need'' to be written with vowels in order to be understood is irrelevent to the question, as is the fact that vowels ''can'' be written, since they generally aren't (the Koran, dictionaries, and children's primars notwithstanding). 
::::Italian is defective because the script doesn't distinguish /ts/ from /dz/, and only has five letters for seven vowels. I believe this info was originally in the article, but it looks like someone took it out as excess detail. [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] 21:00, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

== Hmm... ==

The statement "These are all considerations in the design of a writing system" is, for lack of a better word, misleading. It implies that writing systems were actually ''designed'', rather than simply evolving over time through cultural/social means. I'm going to remove the sentence for now. If someone can rewrite it so that it's meaningful, give it a shot. [[User:Fuzzform|Fuzzform]] ([[User talk:Fuzzform|talk]]) 01:34, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
:You have a point when it comes to orthographies of major languages, which are often in place for centuries, and they just keep growing, often wildly. There are, however, numerous smaller languages in the world which undergo [[language development]]. Usually, the first order of business in language development is orthography-'''design'''. Ideally, linguists will work together with the language community to come up with an orthography which serves the people best. This is a design process, and the abovementioned considerations are important for this. [[User:Landroving Linguist|Landroving Linguist]] ([[User talk:Landroving Linguist|talk]]) 16:48, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

::Some writing systems were most definitely designed, often developed from earlier established scripts like Pali. An example that sprung to mind was Thai, which was established under the then King Amkhamhaeng the Great. Another example is the faintly ridiculous [[Katakana]]; allegedly, the Japanese realised that Western languages could not be adequately transcribed in [[Hiragana]], so tasked some scholars with filling the gap. What they did was simply to copy Hiragana using different symbols, producing a system with exactly the same inadequacies. Very amusing, but a little stupid.  See [[List_of_inventors_of_writing_systems]].[[User:Memethuzla|Memethuzla]] ([[User talk:Memethuzla|talk]]) 14:41, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
:::Not true, katakana was not designed with Western languages in mind. Both katakana and hiragana were developed in the Heian period, the former for transcribing Buddhist sutras and the latter as a cursive shorthand for [[Man'yōgana]]. In fact before WWII katakana was preferred to hiragana in official documents. Only in 1946 were the usages of the two kana systems separated the way they are now. Not because katakana was somehow seen as better fitting to Western languages, just for better parsing: Japanese is written without spaces, so the three writing systems help delineate word boundaries (though not in all cases). Since Western loanwords usually cannot be written with kanji it was decided that they should be written in katakana to separate them from native and Chinese words.[[Special:Contributions/83.243.71.142|83.243.71.142]] ([[User talk:83.243.71.142|talk]]) 10:13, 15 May 2011 (UTC)

== Complex orthographies ==
The text currently says "Complex orthographies often combine different types of scripts and/or utilize many different complex punctuation rules."  AFAIK, punctuation has nothing to do with it.  There are several issues--combining different types of scripts is, I guess, one of them (someone who knows more about Japanese can perhaps confirm that).  Other issues include the use of context-sensitive forms of letters (like Arabic), and complex rules for positioning when combining characters (Bengali and many other languages written with Indic scripts).  But I am looking at this from the perspective of computer rendering of written forms, and maybe there are other considerations when it comes to hand-written texts (like the number of different characters in the writing system).

== Typology ==

Shouldn't [[Etymology|etymological]] spelling be one of the kinds of spelling systems together with phonemic and morpho-phonemic? --[[User:Antonielly|Antonielly]] ([[User talk:Antonielly|talk]]) 21:48, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
:Interesting, but why? What do you mean by "etymological spelling"? Supply some examples, please. Cheers [[User:Bjenks|Bjenks]] ([[User talk:Bjenks|talk]]) 00:31, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
::For instance, in Portuguese, the word ''hospital'' (stress on the last syllable). The "h" is not pronounced in Portuguese, it is there only due to etymological reasons. If the Portuguese ortography were phonemic (one of the categories listed in the article), that word would be written ''ospital''.
::In English, I could mention the words ''colonel'' and ''kernel''. If the ortography were phonemic rather than etymological in those cases, then those two words would be written the same. --[[User:Antonielly|Antonielly]] ([[User talk:Antonielly|talk]]) 11:00, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Good, but aren't these examples of the [[Orthography#Defectiveness|"defectiveness"]], ie, irregularity, accounted for in the article? I understand how etymology can cause irregularity in both pronunciation and semantics (cf shirt-skirt, brush-brake, and OE blac (black) vs blac (pale). But I also see that orthographic spelling and pronunciation are logically about morphemes, phonemes and an appreciation of "defective" examples. If we add an 'etymology' type, will we perhaps then have to include further types, eg, modern [[spelling reform]], [[dialect]] and [[sociolect]], etc? Or are all such 'types' best handled in the separate articles proper to them? [[User:Bjenks|Bjenks]] ([[User talk:Bjenks|talk]]) 12:39, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

This seems completely inadequate as a typology of orthographic systems. I know of no source (and the article cites none) that divides the world of orthographies into phonemic, morpho-phonemic, and defective, full-stop. These terms seem to be applicable only to alphabets, abjads, and syllabaries. Where are the logographic or mixed orthographies? Should transcription systems not commonly used by speakers (ASL comes to mind, as does IPA) be considered another type? I really don't know, but I would bet that scholars have considered such questions. If they have, cite them. If they have not, this section is original research and therefore inappropriate for Wikipedia.

This is not my area of expertise, but I'm fairly sure that the current typology misrepresents world orthographies, so I would be surprised if it ''does not'' misrepresent the state of accepted scholarship.

By the way, the typology section only mentions the terms "alphabet", "abjad", and "syllabary" in passing, and they are not defined anywhere on the page. These should be key terms in a typology, I think. At the very least they should be defined on a page about orthography. [[User:Cnilep|Cnilep]] ([[User talk:Cnilep|talk]]) 04:16, 24 December 2010 (UTC)
:Each subject matter you can cut up according to different typologies. Orthographies are no exception. Whether an orthography is based on phonemes, syllables, morphemes - that is a typology according to the dimension on ''what'' is represented. The typology in this article rather asks ''how'' things are represented in orthographies based on sounds (phonemes or syllables). Of course both typologies feature in the literature. I agree with you that ''phonemic'', ''morphophonemic'' or ''defective'' is not a very happy way to express things, and rather reflects the state of the discussion in the 1960s. A better idea you may get from Keith Snider's ''Linguistic factors in orthography design'' from 2001 (published in: Ngessimo M. Mutaka and Sammy B. Chumbow, Research mate in African linguistics: focus on Cameroon p. 323-332. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag). This article discusses the question of which level of linguistic representation should be used in orthography design, and argues for the [[lexical phonology|lexical]] level, as opposed to the post-lexical level. As I say, it is just another dimension according to which to classify orthographies.

::Thank you for that very useful pointer. I will see whether my university's library has the book.

::To the subject of this page as currently written, though, I take you comments to imply that independent sources do not advocate the particular typological system described here, is that right? Or were you suggesting that work in the 1960s did use such a system? As you say, it is possible to create any number of typologies. If that described here was created by WP editors for this page, though, it seems out of step with the policy [[WP:No original research]].

== Importance of Orthography ==

The importance of orthography is stressed in the studies of Linguistic. So the subject of it's important should be a main focus of the Wikipedia page for the overall topic of orthography. The information on orthography is already limited, new facts and connection to other topics can boost the overall length of the article.

== Contingent variation ==


<blockquote>
Sometimes there may be variation in a language's orthography, as between American and British spelling in the case of English orthography.
</blockquote>

In the formal Canadian register, our orthography is predominantly British. In the informal register, our orthography is rife with Americanisms, almost to the point where anything goes (from either camp): even if the document on its own terms is inconsistent from one place to another. 

At the semi-formal end—where the writer projects an educated persona, but might not be writing a formal piece as such—it's considered bad form to mix and match on an inconsistent basis (choose one or the other on each major decision point and stick with it), but only the most vigilant fussbudget reads carefully enough to notice this (Margaret Atwood?), so in practice this has little ultimate import (apart from, I suspect, some internal, rivalrous score-keeping). 

It's not that different in Canada with measurement, either. 

You can mix kg and °F in the same document (like a blog post), hardly anyone would bat an eyelash, though randomly switching between kg and lbs in the same document would attract some notice. You can also use °K for gas cylinders, °C for outdoor temperature, and then °F for your souffle recipe in the same post, and no Canadian would find this weird, either (living as a quasi-British culture as the cranial cumberbund of The Beast as we do, the "when in Rome" factor in Canada is unusually contextual). Canadian ovens are all in Fahrenheit, Canadian radio is all in Celsius, Canadian science is all in French (units), Canadian grocery pricing is half and half (until you get to the till, where receipts are recorded in kg only). 

I'm not going to source any of this, but it's a thing, and if someone has a source, it wouldn't hurt the article to put the contingent dimension forward. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 21:19, 14 June 2018 (UTC)
