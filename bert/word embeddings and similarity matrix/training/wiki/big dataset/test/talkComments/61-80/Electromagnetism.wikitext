==Animation of lightning at top of page==
Is having a distracting animation of lightning at the top of this page appropriate for electromagnetism? that animation would be better on the lighting article and certainly not at the top of any page.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/124.176.51.109|124.176.51.109]] ([[User talk:124.176.51.109|talk]]) 07:06, 13 December 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:Agreed. I've cut the two images entirely; I don't think the reader really benefits in their understanding of electromagnetism by being shown what a magnet and some lightning look like. --[[User:McGeddon|McGeddon]] ([[User talk:McGeddon|talk]]) 17:58, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

This article, being a gateway, should have some illustrations. I agree that the lightning bolt animation is very distracting, and a image of a bar magnet doing notiong is of no value whatever. I kind of liked the idea of a ''static'' lightning bolt, but I'm not sure what its point is relative to electromagnetism. Given that, are there illustrations that ''would'' be useful, e.g. a photo of "lines of force" around both a bar magnet and an electromagnet made with iron filings (the point being that electric current makes "magnetism", and this is the same "stuff" as a bar-magnet's "magnetism"), and an equivalent electrostatics photo-image? (Good luck creating that one!) An electromagnet hanging by thin wires in a gravitational field (like a pendulum) and being pulled sideways by another electromagnet? (Easy to do). Ditto for a tinfoil-covered styrofoam ball being repelled by a charged plate? (Not so easy; this one I found as a problem in a physics text in a chapter on the electric field -- to calculate the angle from vertical; cf Sears and Zemanski 1964:564 problem 25-11, also p. 538 problem 24-4). As a kid I learned about "magnetism" from iron-filing making lines of force, and the experience that two magnets either repel or attract.  Electrostatics I learned from charged balloons repelling or attracting, and scuffing my feet to make sparks (and to light up a neon light). That they are equivalent "stuff" in different forms is not a trivial factoid -- what you'd need to illustrate the idea is a triboelectrically-charged leaf-electroscope hooked to a Leyden jar that, when discharged through a coil of wire, moves a compass-needle.

== Chaotic and emergent phenomena ==

This section seems to be fringe or speculative science.  Should it be part of the article?

: Thanks @Constant314 :-) if you had to single out specific points about the section, what aspects in particular do you find to be too speculative or fringe?  Previous edits claimed that QED could explain all aspects of electromagnetic phenomena, which I would be concerned about. How do we show readers that there are many electromagnetic phenomena which cannot be explained by (even by the quantum) linear electromagnetic equations i.e. Aharonov–Bohm effect, Beltrami plasma vortices, phase changes associated with superconductivity etc.[[User:Sparkyscience|Sparkyscience]] ([[User talk:Sparkyscience|talk]]) 21:30, 4 November 2016 (UTC)

::I don’t know, so I am flagging the section for others to examine.  But my concerns are two.  In any article there is always the tension between not enough information and too much.  An article about electromagnetism, reasonably could go into the QED under-pinning.  A “something is wrong with QED” section is two steps removed from the subject of the article.  It rightly goes into an article on QED.  That’s my opinion.  Secondly, a “QED doesn’t work” statement is extraordinary.  I would want to see solid secondary references such as main line university physics text books.  Let’s examine the statement that Aharonov–Bohm effect cannot be explained by QED.  Scientific theories never explain anything; they make predictions. From my admittedly dated readings about the Aharonov–Bohm effect was that it was predicted by QED and that is what led to the experiment.  Are you suggesting that AB is not predictable from QED?  [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 22:06, 4 November 2016 (UTC)

:::Hi [[User talk:Constant314|Constant314]], thanks for going through your valid points and sorry its been a while to get back to you. I completely understand the concerns raised. I suppose the real point that I'm trying to get across is not that ''"QED is wrong"'' or a point which is two steps removed from electromagnetism. I agree such things would be too far down the rabbit hole for this article; if this is how the current revision appears to the reader then current version must be changed. What i'm trying to do (...rather badly?) is emphasise an aspect about electromagnetism that is orthogonal to '''both''' classical ''and'' quantum electrodynamics, the aspect of ''nonlinearity''.

:::The thing that is of note about the AB effect is not that it it is a quantum phenomena... but that it is non-local. i.e. the effects occur when there is a nontrivial field potential leading to forces which are not local in nature and therefore we sometimes require non-Abelian commutation relations, where potentials can be used to create local-to-global effects, to make accurate predictions. Beltrami plasma vortices can be understood on purely on classical terms (i.e not a two steps removed quantum phenomena), but again cannot be understood through your typical linear equations, same thing with superconductivity phase transitions and the Tesla circuit example... There's more to electromagnetism then Maxwell's equations (or quantized versions) would have you believe, and these  effects should be highlighted, because they make electromagnetism interesting! 

::: As an aside, I did not make a ''"QED is wrong"'' statement, but i can see why you might have interpreted the above remark as such, QED works great if you can apply perturbation theory, i.e. nonlinearity converges to a simplified linear problem, but this isn't always the case. In my edit on the page, I corrected the article from ''"All electromagnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of quantum mechanics, specifically by quantum electrodynamics"'' to ''"[QED gives] extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the Lamb shift and measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron...[and] is one of the most accurate theories known to physics in situations where perturbation theory can be applied.'' 

::: I would recommend skimming over Barret & Grimes (1995)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Terence William|last2=Grimes|first2=Dale M.|title=Advanced Electromagnetism: Foundations, Theory and Applications|date=1995|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789810220952|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lA8tgLMRu2kC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> to get a clearer picture of what I'm trying to get across with respect to nonlinearity. The forward by [[Roger Penrose]] seems prescient to our current conversation:

::::''"There can be little doubt that Maxwell's equations constitute one of the great landmarks in physical theory. Their basic accuracy has been confirmed innumerable times, in many different types of experiment. Their invariance properties led Einstein to his special theory of relativity. Moreover, their gauge-theoretic interpretations led to non-Abelian generalizations, fundamental to modern particle physics. Their elegant mathematical form has provided several important influences on the development of mathematics itself.

::::''These facts should not, however, deter theoretical or experimental physicists from seeking alternative descriptions, unconventional formulations, surprising electromagnetic effects, or radical generalizations. The various articles in this book provide the reader with a great variety of different kinds of approach to developments of this nature. We have historically motivated accounts, suggestions for new experiments, unconventional viewpoints and attempts at generalizations. We also see novel and ingenious formulations of electromagnetic theory of various different kinds.''

::::''I am sure that this book will make it clear that electromagnetism is a subject that is in no way closed to simulating new developments. It is very much alive as a source of fruitful new ideas."''

:::Perhaps some rewording to this effect would be useful in highlighting to the reader that what we know about electromagnetism has had a huge impact but that it is not a closed subject? I'm not sure I've done that by any means. As for what i've already written, I certainly don't mind re-edits if not complete revision. The electromagnetism article does need a lot of work. I would be wary of wholesale deletion of the section. So long as we make it clear in the article what is well established within electromagnetism (which of course should be the majority of the article) and what is not well established i feel this subject matter which you have termed ''"fringe"'' or ''"speculative"'' (...I can't see any overtly dodgy references?) is in fact the ''"cutting edge"'' and does have a place on the article. Science, after all, is not a set of facts in textbooks but a method and process of discovery.  [[User:Sparkyscience|Sparkyscience]] ([[User talk:Sparkyscience|talk]]) 11:42, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

::::I'm not suggesting that theoretical or experimental physicists should be deterred from seeking alternative descriptions, unconventional formulations but that rather that alternative descriptions don't belong in this article until they become main stream.

:::::Aharonov et al. (2016) ''"We have shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect has two distinct aspects, one continuous and one instantaneous. The latter is manifestly nonlocal; it underlines the necessity of describing quantum systems via gauge-dependent quantities rather than local forces, which cannot account for abrupt changes in modular velocity."''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aharonov|first1=Yakir|last2=Cohen|first2=Eliahu|last3=Rohrlich|first3=Daniel|title=Nonlocality of the Aharonov-Bohm|journal=Phys.

:::::You seem to be offering very little in the way of references to back up your (currently subjective) opinion that this is fringe, speculative or not mainstream. If it is a peer reviewed journal, or it is a published article by a univeristy professor in a textbook, I think most would agree that you can not just dismiss the scientific points raised in the edit with the hand-waving you have thus far done; it needs to debated with countering peer reviewed argument of equal merit. To my mind gauge theories, non-abelian groups, nonlinearity are very well developed scientific concepts and have a place in electromagnetic theory and have many interesting and surprising results that a reader may be interested in... If you have any references to back up your opinion that they have no place in electromagnetic theory... that's great... but so far you've said you ''"don't know"'' what parts in particular you want to flag...I fear you are merely operating on a hunch...or because you are not familiar with this aspect of the subject matter that must mean it is somehow wrong...

"The electromagnetic force is responsible for practically '''all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale''', with the '''exception of gravity'''. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of '''chemical''' phenomena".

If I sit in a phycics or chemistry class, and watch my teacher do some physics and chemistry demonstrations, are 100% of them explained by electomagnetic force & gravity? (At high school or university).

==Too practical==

I'm actually kind of aggravated.  I'm trying to understand the theoretical, even philosophical, nature of magnetism, polarization, etc. etc...  For instance, does not magnetism have a lot to do with the concept of an object's direction of "spin", as is tends to dictate the position of the poles in a perpendicular direction?  Shouldn't we have some more fundamental explanations going on here, especially in the beginning?  Beginning the article with "electro" this and "electron" that, is kind of like a case of 'using the term in the definition'.  I'd do it myself, obviously, if I didn't come here to understand it myself.  I would propose something along the lines of:

"Electromagnetism" is a physical phenomenon resulting from an object which is said to exhibit polarity.  Cases of polarity usually result from an object's spin, elementary orientation in single direction, and other such cases of binary opposition of the aspects of a single object.  Electromagnetism, then, is considered to be a "force" which tends to produce effects in other nearby objects as a result of the transactions between the poles... etc. etc...  I mean, what -is- electromagnetism?  Calling it electrons in movement is presumptuous.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/72.242.110.218|72.242.110.218]] ([[User talk:72.242.110.218|talk]]) 18:06, 15 September 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Misc.==

Next, there's how to transform the electric field under relativity, then there's defining and calculating B (an extremely long section since it turns out to be a combination of relativity and E), then how B and E transform under relativity, and finally a derivation of the wave equation for electromagnetic waves. So much to do, so little time. The vector potential is probably also worth mentioning...

Some points:
 The magnetic field due to a wire is stationary only if the wire is at rest in an inertial frame and carries a stationary current. The electric field between the plates of a capacitor is stationary only if the plates are at rest in an inertial frame and have a stationary charge distribution.

The form did not work (on my computer).

----

I think the derivation of the wave equation should go under [[:electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic wave]] or under [[:wave equation|wave equation]], maybe even under [[:electromagnetic wave equation|electromagnetic wave equation]]. Otherwise, this article is going to get too long.
I may take a crack at deriving the WE soon, since I want to refer to it for [[:nonlinear optics|nonlinear optics]]. As for the equations, I can't find a font with &amp;nabla; in it. Perhaps curl and div would be better, though this won't match the rest of the Wikipedia -- DrBob

----
Ok, right about the article's length. You may want to try Mozilla as a browser, and from what I've heard the special characters used in Wikipedia are an HTML standard. At any rate, the wave equation isn't that tough to derive (now that I have my notes to look at), just take the curl of the two Maxwell's equations that have the curl in them, and use the mathematical identity:

&nabla;&times;&nabla;&times;'''A''' = -&nabla;<sup>2</sup>'''A''' + &nabla;(&nabla;·'''A''')

for any vector field '''A''' (there may be some caveats, but I'm fairly sure that they don't apply to actual magnetic and electric fields). Then use the fact that you want speed of light in a vacuum to say that div('''E''') = 0 and curl('''j''') = 0. It gets considerably more sticky in matter since those last two are no longer true and they're tied to particles that have mass and their own electric fields. --BlackGriffen

----
I just wanted to ask about the use of the permittivity of free space.  I would think it is better to use the permittivity as a general variable (&epsilon) so the formulas would be valid if the charges were suspended in glass or any other medium besides free space.  I wasn't sure whether there was a reason to use the free space value, so I didn't change it.

There is unnecessary comment in one part of this article which says « Carlo is gay» which i think should be removed.  a little serious please

== Esoteric? ==

I have issues with the second paragraph if the article:

*''While the electric and magnetic forces may sound fairly esoteric'' &mdash; Esoteric? anyone who has combed their hair, used a magnet, or gotten a shock from a metallic door handle has first-hand experience of electric and magnetic forces. What is esoteric about it?
*''the attractive forces between atoms in a solid that give rise to the rigidity of solids are predominantly electromagnetic'' &mdash; the rigidity of solids is a result of the balance of attractive electromagnetic forces and a '''non-electromagnetic''' repulsive force coming from Pauli's [[exclusion principle]]. There are repulsive electromagnetic forces, but it is impossible to obtain mechanical equilibrium using only electromagnetic means. It is still true that all the phenomena described are electromagnetic.

Also, someone complained that [[Maxwell's equations]] is hard to understand. Maybe we can design a suggested itinerary through the electromagnetism hierarchy of articles, starting from the easiest, most physically intuitive articles and advancing to more specialized topics such as Maxwell's equations.

== First paragraph is just wrong ==

The first paragraph reads:
{{blockquote|Electromagnetism is the physics of the electromagnetic field; a field encompassing all of space which exerts a force on particles that possess the property of electric charge, and is in turn affected by the presence and motion of those particles.}}

There is no one field encompassing all of space; the second clause of the first sentence is just wrong. Fields only emanate from charged particles or the motion thereof (propagating waves originate from same), and are in fact only an abstraction of the effects of charged particles on each other. I think the fact that they are an abstraction should be emphasized. Somehow the description seems to say that there is one field: a substrate upon which charged particles act (also wrong).[[User:Cjpuffin|<font style="background: black" face="Lucinda Console" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;CjPuffin&nbsp;</font>]] 23:19, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:Cj, it's true that each electron (and other charged particle) creates its own EM field, but it's also fair to say that the sum of all such fields constitutes a single field that fills all of space.  (It follows from linearity of Maxwell's equations.)  In fact, the more general view is that the charged particles themselves are also excitations in fields that permeate all space.  The idea of field is distinct from suggesting there is some substrate containing it.  [[User:Gnixon|Gnixon]] 23:23, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

::Alright, I'll buy that you can consider there to be one field that is the sum of the effects of all particles, but it is sort of a stretch. When we talk about gravitational fields, do we talk about one huge field?

:::It's ''definitely'' common to think of one field, and thinking at the same time of the many fields that sum to it is common, too.  The same is true for gravity, although often the only important field comes from one object (indeed, you can consider it to come from one point mass if it's a spherical object).  In E&M, where more complicated charge distributions are common, idea of one overall field is even more useful.  [[User:Gnixon|Gnixon]] 23:52, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

== Gilbert's "De Magnete", probable error about ==

I have a copy of Gilbert's "De Magnete" (Dover edition).
I am 99% sure that Gilbert DID NOT discover electrostatic
repulsion, surprising as it sounds. Unfortunately I don't
have time immediately to check this. In any case I feel
the onus to do so should fall upon the author. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Eljeh Yendig|Eljeh Yendig]] ([[User talk:Eljeh Yendig|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eljeh Yendig|contribs]]) 01:21, 4 May 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->

==Copied from Comments page==
I am not a formally trained scientist but have always had a scientific curiosity.  Regarding electromagnetivity I recently enjoyed the public broadcastings' APB program's education about Maxwell's contributions and noticed the skimming over of the concept of time as an element of electromagnetism but not as a manipulable factor.  The constructive/destructive wave interference was discussed and summarily explored and tangentally discussed timing.   It seems to me that an antigravity device lies in manipulating the timing and power of the waves.  I wonder whether gravity has been considered as important in exploring the theories of electromagnetism.  If gravity is also a wave and light and magnetism are waves then the timing of a photoelectromagnetic wave could be tuned to cancel out gravity and also be used to effect a propulsion.

== [[Template:Electromagnetism]] vs [[Template:Electromagnetism2]] ==

I have thought for a while that the electromagnetism template is too long.  I feel it gives a better overview of the subject if all of the main topics can be seen together.  I created a [[Template:Electromagnetism2|new template]] and gave an explanation on the old (i.e. current) template [[Template_talk:Electromagnetism|talk page]], however I don't think many people are watching that page.

I have modified this article to demonstrate the new template and I would appreciate people's thoughts on it: constructive criticism, arguments for or against the change, suggestions for different layouts, etc.

To see an example of a similar template style, check out [[Template:Thermodynamic_equations]].  This example expands the sublist associated with the main topic article currently being viewed, then has a separate template for each main topic once you are viewing articles within that topic.  My personal preference (at least for electromagnetism) would be to remain with just one template and expand the main topic sublist for all articles associated with that topic.--[[User:DJIndica|DJIndica]] 16:54, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

== Forest of articles, a quick explanation of "why electromagnetism"? ==
There are so many articles in this series I couldn't figure out whether this explanation/derivation exists in one of them, or not. (I can contribute some drawings etc if anyone thinks its worth the while). The explanation is easy, and I've used it before with good results (I think I found it in one of my old college texts -- Resnick and Halliday probably). It shows ''why'', given relativity, moving electrons create magnetic fields. 

We start with a column of free electrons in a given length of copper wire, say a meter lenth of it. The electrons are free because they escape their atoms' outer orbitals (definition of a metal). The electrons just wander about thereby cancelling their minus-charge with respect to the copper ions' positive charge -- all is neutral. But if they are compelled to ''drift'' because of an applied electric field along the wire, their drift velocity causes the apparent 1-meter length of ions to contract, due to the Lorentz contraction. The result is an excess concentration of electrons in the now shortened "tube" of moving electrons. This excess charge is no longer neutral with respect to the stationary column of positive ions. Thus this electrostatic-derived force represents an external force, albeit tiny, that is (i) measureable and (ii) related to the electrons' velocity. This is the so-called "magnetic" force. The vector part of it (i.e. the apparent "direction" of the force" is much harder and probably not necessary to explain.  Bill [[User:Wvbailey|Wvbailey]] ([[User talk:Wvbailey|talk]]) 16:10, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

See [[Relativistic electromagnetism]]. The attribution of this to 1966 Purcell is a bit odd, since I used a text (not by Purcell -- Halliday and Resnick, I believe) in the mid 1960's that had this explanation in it.

== Merging [[Electromagnetic force]], article sections and cleanup. ==

Hi guys,

I've started tidying and simplifying the text of this article, and also merged the content of the [[Electromagnetic force]] in to this article using the following rationale:

* Although there are articles on [[electrostatic force]], [[electromotive force]], [[electric force]], [[magnetic force]], etc, those articles describe various ''subsets'' of Electomagnetism, whereas the Electromagnetic force ''is'' Electromagnetism.
* More than half of this content was duplicated in that article already.

There is still some duplicate information that I intend to weed out, and it might also be a good idea to reconsider the section headings too.

What do you guys think?

I prefer that this section has in-line citations. I think it is an important section. However, there are internal links to the main articles related to the paragraphs.

== Organization of electromagnetism. ==

There is no motion in straight line in the space of the material Universe and there is no linear flow of time. All change, whether temporal or spatial, is continuous and the change follows rings of converging spiral. Rotations of gravitons in a unit of space can be organized into a unit of electromagnetism such as photon. The packet of rotations travels with maximum possible velocity of 'c' along the largest ring of the spiral 'c'. With distanvce from the observer velocity of transformation slows down until, at the border of the space of th Universe, it approaches '0', but only as seen by the observer in the centre of the spiral. By beinbg motivated from the perfect centre velocity of the electromagnetic unit is accelerated. This being impossible, because velocity 'c' is maximum, the additional velocity changes direction and it travels along the ring of the converging spiral which is at right angles to the direction of 'c'. Only the direction at right angles does not add or subtract anything from the velocity of 'c'. Velocity in the new direction is less than 'c' and it can vary as 'n' in (0<n<c). The velocity of 'n' decides on the spatial magnitude, called 'amplitude' of the unit of electromagnetism. Velocity of transformation on the spiral 'n' is accelerated from minimum at the largest ring to maximum in the centre of the spiral 'n'. At the maximum magnitude of 'n' the electromagnetic unit is a 'wave'. In the centre the unit has the properties of a 'particle'. Because the spiral 'n' travels with velocity 'c', dynamism of the spiral 'n' traces sinusoidal volume called 'wavelength' The same laws apply to the direction 'c'. At maximum distance from the point of observation, at the border of space, electromagnetic unit travels in the direction approaching straight line  and velocity of rotation of gravitons approaches '0'. In the centre of the converging spiral 'c', velocity is maximum of 'c' but on the smallest ring 1/c of the spiral.

The above uses the archaic term "galvanic current," which presumably is what we would now simply call a current or possibly an electrical current.

Ive looked through almost every page linked herein, but I have failed to find anything that explains the electromagnetic phenomenon that stops things from merging with other things -- for instance, i can grab someones hand or the wall, and I wont become that object; id always remain distinct.

If I missed this, or if it was worded in a way I might not understand, I would love a link. And if its not there, why not? Surely this is an issue that would be of interest to people, since its what allows "people" instead of whatever the word for everything combined would be. Also if it is here, I think it should be made more prominent.

This is just the repulsion between matter at close distances. You are right to say this is an interesting and fundamental phenomenon, and is the reason for solid objects. You can basically explain it in terms of electrostatics:

An object is a large number of positive charges (protons in atomic nuclei) and practically the same number of negative charges (electrons in atoms and chemical bonds). The forces between individual charges are quite large, but when two such objects are far away the forces basically cancel each other out as for each atom the distances between the two regions of positive and two regions of negative are basically the same. When two objects are very close however, at the contact point, the adjacent electrons are closer to each other than they are to the adjacent protons, so there is a large repulsion force.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.111.248.243|131.111.248.243]] ([[User talk:131.111.248.243|talk]]) 03:44, 25 November 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Responsible for all phenomena ==

The first paragraph says "Electromagnetism is responsible for practically all the phenomena encountered in daily life". I don't think this statement is true; it's certainly very vague.

For instance, if the strong force didn't exist, we would not have the phenomenon of atoms, and 'daily life' would be extremely different. I suggest refining this section.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.111.248.243|131.111.248.243]] ([[User talk:131.111.248.243|talk]]) 03:35, 25 November 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: This point is valid; the claim is excessive. I would add that this is the case, even if extended to include all of the forces.  The statement must be rephrased so that "practically all the phenomena encountered in daily life" does not get so readily interpreted to mean just that – it is misleading (as seen in the point above, [[#Individuality?]]).  Just because electromagnetism plays a part in interatomic and intermolecular forces does not mean that it is "responsible for" these phenomena. Its explanatory power simply does not go so far.  Electromagnetism merely explains the attraction between electrons and atomic nuclei; it does not even remotely explain atomic radii. It does not explain the structure of atoms, and contrary to many textbook explanations (and this article), does not fully explain atomic bonding and intermolecular forces, which underlie a large number of everyday phenomena.
: It may be simplest to regard a force as an amount momentum exchanged per unit time, for example as two ice skaters throwing a heavy ball to each other repeatedly will experience a repulsive force (though a ball on a string may be more apt for atoms and molecules, with the attractive force on the exchanged ball being mediated by the string caught to swing the ball back). Crucial to the model of interatomic bonding is the exchange of the electron between two nuclei, with the slingshot effect of the exchanged electron being attracted on the far side providing all the repulsive force which balances the direct electrical attraction: it is movement of the electrons themselves (with the momentum this carries) that is a substantial part of the force; this part has nothing to do with electromagnetism and cannot be neglected. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (which I guess would be interpreted as the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] at the single-particle level) ensures that each electron's momentum has a lower limit (depending on how many are in the same volume); this provides stability to atomic radii, intermolecular distances etc.
:I think the statement is unnecessarily misleading to a large proportion of the target audience. To revise it suitably is a challenge though.
