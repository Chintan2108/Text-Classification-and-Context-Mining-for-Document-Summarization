:''Discussions on Swedish phonology have been moved to [[Talk:Swedish phonology]].''

== Official status ==
For some reason, Sweden was placed above Finland in the list of countries where Swedish is official. Such lists are alphabetical, (see [[German language]] or [[Spanish language]]) so I changed the order here.[[User:JdeJ|JdeJ]] ([[User talk:JdeJ|talk]]) 11:55, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

== Number of speakers ==

We need to establish a consensus for how to accurately present the number of speakers. The latest suggestion[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swedish_language&diff=269629049&oldid=268724679] is a step in the right direction, but it's very much a guesstimate. The number of native speakers of Swedish in Finland seems accurate since the figure comes from an official statistics bureau. The figure from Ethnologue is unreliable, however. Ethnologue does not conduct statistical studies and the cites no external sources in this case. The conclusion in the footnote mixes native and non-native; living in Sweden is not synonymous with being a native speaker of Swedish. I checked the article "svenska" in [[Nationalencyklopedin]], and noticed that they have added more detailed statistics. Their figures puts the number of native speakers at 8.5 million in 2007, breaking them down in the following way:

*Sweden: 7.7 million
*Finland: 295,000
*US: 101,000
*Norway: 43,000
*UK: 32,000
*Germany: 30,000
*Spain: 17,000
*France: 15,000
*Denmark: 11,000
*Canada: 9,000
*Australia: 6,000
*Switzerland: 6,000
*Belgium: 5,000
*Italy: 3,500

These figures are interesting and seem quite believable to me. The US figure seems very high, but it could be plausible since US culture has a firm basis in Sweden and there might still be a lot of emigration there. I have no idea what the source is for these figures, though. There's a bibliography at the end of the article, but none of the titles seem to have anything to do with statistics, and the most recently published source is from 1999.

I think the biggest problem is that we need a stricter division between native and non-native speakers, especially when it comes to Finland. If we include the large proportion of native Finnish speakers that can speak Swedish, we're probably talking about an additional million. And what about Denmark and Norway? At least half of all Norwegian speakers could be considered to be more or less fluent in Swedish.

Does anyone else have ideas on how to handle this or suggestions about reliable sources?

:Finland counts as Swedish-speakers those Finns who self-identify as ''[[Swedish-speaking Finns|finlandssvenskar]]''. That means they self-identify as native speakers of Swedish, although many are completely bilingual. On the other hand, Swedish has been an obligatory language at comprehensive school since 1970 and at high school since 18th century. Every Finn who is less than 40 years old has at least rudimentary Swedish skills. In addition, every Finn who has a higher education should be capable of speaking and writing Swedish at satisfactory level. However, this statistic is not followed by the authorities. --[[User:MPorciusCato|MPorciusCato]] ([[User talk:MPorciusCato|talk]]) 15:20, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

::Something in the back of my head tells me that has been an EU publication (circa 2007? possibly prepared for the Commission) on the number of native speakers of the various official EU languages within the union, as well as the number of people who speaks/understood the languages. Its publishing was probably related to EU's (over?)ambitious goal that all citizens should know (at least) two foreign languages to a level where they can engage in an everyday conversation. Although the data probably only would refer to the number of speakers inside EU, this would cover most Swedish-speakers, and also contain data that could be of use for other articles. I don't remember the exact title or have a link, but perhaps it could be unearthed by some Googling? I did browse it online at some time, as I recall. [[User:Tomas e|Tomas e]] ([[User talk:Tomas e|talk]]) 19:10, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

: Hi Peter. I appreciate the initiative! You are right that my guess is very rough, but it seemed to me that the old figure was way too high, so i whipped up a new estimate with the limit amount of data/time i had. If you have a better idea how to come up with a reliable number, go for it! -- [[User:Uluboz|Uluboz]] ([[User talk:Uluboz|talk]]) 20:00, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

Many other language articles contain an estimate of the number of the total number of speakers, including also those that are non-native but are able to participate in a conversation in the language. For example, the article on the Dutch language refers to the Special Eurobarometer 243 from the European Commission <ref>http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf</ref> to assert that in fact 5 million people in Europe speak Dutch as a foreign language. The same source assesses that 41 % of all Finnish people whose native tongue is not Swedish are able to converse in the language. The same applies to 11 % of the people in Denmark. The investigation was made in 2005, meaning that out of the 5,136,000 Finns that were not native Swedish speakers and out of the 5,419,000 Danes, 2,106,000 Finns and 596,000 Danes were able to converse in Swedish. 
Regarding the number of speakers of Swedish in Sweden itself, there is not really any statistics on the knowledge among the foreign-born, but we can assume that any foreign-born who is a Swedish citizen is able to converse in the language. According to the SCB, that number would be 841,179<ref>http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____26041.aspx</ref>. 
These groups add upp to approximately 3,543,000. Adding that to the number of native speakers currently displayed (8.7 million), gives us a total number of 12.2 million speakers. ([[User:Jonas Henriksson|Jonas Henriksson]] ([[User talk:Jonas Henriksson|talk]]) 22:57, 23 February 2013 (UTC))

:These conclusions are based on deduction and a great deal of speculation on your part. What you're claiming is not [[WP:V|verifiable]] per Wikipedia policy. You need to find a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] where someone with some sort of authority states these figures. Deducing them from various surveys, which are very general in nature, is considered [[WP:OR|original research]].
:[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 23:54, 24 February 2013 (UTC)

:Jonas, please don't add these kind of figures to the article despite the concerns about original research and whatnot. At the very least, having these figures in the lead is not appropriate, though it would be interesting to have a nuanced discussion about the number of non-native speakers in the body of the article.
:[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 06:55, 26 February 2013 (UTC)

::Peter, ok, I am very sorry, perhaps it was too bold to make this change. However, even if unintended on your part, I must say that you are applying a double standard here. As I wrote above, the article about the [[Dutch language]] uses the responses from the Special Eurobarometer 243 to calculate the number of secondary speakers, mainly in Germany. These figures are in the lead of that article. Why can we use this source to count Germans as Dutch speakers but not Danes and Finns as Swedish speakers? 
::I agree with you on that it is a speculation to assume that foreign-born that have Swedish citizenship can speak Swedish. Even if it is not a bold speculation, it is perhaps going too far. 
::To be consistent, either the Danes and Finns speaking Swedish need to be added or the Germans speaking Dutch must be removed from the Dutch language article. The source is the same and the position of the figure is the same in the respective articles. Do you agree with me in that Wikipedia should treat figures from the very same source, the Eurobarometer, in the same way? ([[User:Jonas Henriksson|Jonas Henriksson]] ([[User talk:Jonas Henriksson|talk]]) 14:45, 26 February 2013 (UTC))

:::This is not [[Dutch language]] and I don't agree that this particular source should be used in this way. In my view, it's far too imprecise about defining language proficiency to be cited in a lead (which is supposed to be a general summary limited to fairly certain facts). Like I said, it might be discussed in the body of an article, but I don't believe the figures are reliable enough to be in the lead.
:::As for "consistency" across all of Wikipedia, you can't argue that the use of a given reference in one article has to be applied to all articles. Especially when we're talking about an FA and a B-class article. You should argue the relevance of certain references on their own merits, not on whether they're used in other articles or not. Again, we have policies for these cases: [[WP:Reliable sources]] and [[WP:Verifiability]].
:::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 15:13, 26 February 2013 (UTC)

:::: I believe that any figure on the number of secondary speakers of a language would be somewhat imprecise regarding proficiency, unless there is a figure considering only those that have undergone a standardized assessment. I don't believe that any of the figures regarding secondary speakers of any language are based on such a high quality source on wikipedia. Yet mostly every language article dares to make this type of estimation, usually in the table on the right in the beginning. I am sorry to have intruded on your "baby" that won this award. I just found it bothering and unsufficient that many other language articles contained this figure whereas this particular article lacks it. I thought it was just something the authors had overlooked. However, I see that the article might risk its high status if it refers to less reliable sources. ([[User:Jonas Henriksson|Jonas Henriksson]] ([[User talk:Jonas Henriksson|talk]]) 16:49, 26 February 2013 (UTC))

:::::Once again, mentioning it in the article is not a problem. Establishing it as uncontroversial in the lead is different. Please feel free to incorporate this in "Geographic distribution". Just not in the lead. We have policies for that as well, so you might want to check out [[WP:LEAD]].

== Finnish and Swedish ==

I just saw a show where someone spoke a language that, as he explained, originated because people couldn't speak either Swedish or Finnish very well. Therefore they came up with that language which is apparently some sort of mix of the two. His flag was from top to bottom [[white]]-[[blue]]-[[yellow]]. Can anyone tell me where he was from? [[User:Mallerd|Mallerd]] ([[User talk:Mallerd|talk]]) 11:01, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

:He was referring to [[Meänkieli]] which is spoken on the Finnish-Swedish border in the [[Torne Valley]]. It's basically a dialect of Finnish with a lot of Swedish influences that has been defined as a separate language because of repressive Swedish policies towards Finnish-speakers during the 20th century.

I think [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swedish_language&action=historysubmit&diff=335937514&oldid=335189173 these edits] by {{userIP|83.255.33.190}} are problematic for several reasons:
*How is it relevant that some post-1950s Swedish loanwords from English are ultimately (arguably) of Scandinavian origin?
:Varför är det inte relevant, att orden har lånats åt bägge håll? Ett typiskt intressant faktum som platsar alldeles utmärkt i sammanhanget som jag ser det. Om du inte känner till att ett stort antal engelska ord härstammar från skandinavien så se t.ex [[viking age]] (eller gör som jag, läs en bok om engelskans bakgrund och utveckling, kan rekommendera t.ex ''Baker: The English language'').

::Because the section is about the vocabulary of Swedish, talking about loanwords from Swedish in other languages is out of place there. We could have a section on the influence of Swedish on other languages, but that would have to include ''[[ombudsman]]'' and ''[[smörgåsbord]]'' and so forth. This section mentions the influence of other languages on Swedish. Talking about the influence of Swedish on other languages is [[WP:OFFTOPIC]]. [[User:Gabbe|Gabbe]] ([[User talk:Gabbe|talk]]) 14:06, 5 January 2010 (UTC)

*"Electricity" is a somewhat misleading example of a French loan word in Swedish
: Varför det? Det är ett av tusentals franska låneord och lär ursprungligen ha kommit in i svenskan med Gustav III i formen ''elektrifiera''. Det är minst lika vardagligt som de övriga.

::The three examples already given are clear and listing them is concise and to the point. Adding more clutters the article, and risks making it [[WP:TLDR]]. And while the word ''elektricitet'' does come from French, it's arguably more of a [[New Latin]] loanword. As such, I'm not saying it's incorrect, it's just a bad example. [[User:Gabbe|Gabbe]] ([[User talk:Gabbe|talk]]) 14:06, 5 January 2010 (UTC)

::"Nagellackborttagningsmedel" is not a "made up" example, but a rather common word.

== Mistranslation ==

One of the words used as examples of Swedish [[grammar]] is mistranslated.  The word “kavaj” only refers to the jacket part of a [[suit (clothing)|suit]].  If you don't want to replace the word “suit” you may replace “kavaj” with “kostym”.  It is Swedish for “suit” in this sense of the word.  Yes, the two words are inflected the same way.

Don't know where in this talk to address this but 
mannens i grå kostym hatt; "the man's in a grey suit hat"
doesn't make any sense, it ought to be

:The phrase ''mannens grå kostym hatt'' ("the man's grey suit hat") is ungrammatical. You could say ''mannens grå kostymhatt'' ("the man's grey suit-hat"), but then it would mean "the grey suit-hat belonging to the man". The sentence ''mannens i grå kostym hatt'' ("the man's in grey suit hat") is the formal (albeit archaic) way of saying "the hat belonging to the man in a grey suit". For another example, the proper way of saying "the cap belong to [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]" would be ''Karl:s den tolfte mössa'' rather than ''Karl den tolfte:s mössa'' which most people say nowadays.

==Dubious terms==
A few dubious terms occur in the section '''Classification''':
:"Continental Scandinavian languages" vs. "Insular Scandinavian languages"
:"a common Scandinavian language"
These terms need to be attested by sources. The subdivision of East Scandinavian (mutually intelligible, including Bokmål, Swedish, Danish and Scanian) vs. West Scandinavian (generally not mutually intelligible, including Faroese, Icelandic and local Nynorsk block dialects - Nynorsk is an artificial language) is the generally accepted division scheme.

:[http://www.nordiska.uu.se/institutionen/omraden/faroiska Here] is a page from Uppsala University that mentions this classification (in Swedish). Norwegian is historically a West Scandinavian language, which is why there is a need for this second classification based more on intelligibility.

== Sole administrative language of Finland? ==

Certainly Swedish was not SOLE administrative language of Finland until 1902. Finnish (and sometimes even Russian) were used in administrative affairs in Finland already in the latter part of 19th century. [[Special:Contributions/62.78.196.51|62.78.196.51]] ([[User talk:62.78.196.51|talk]]) 18:37, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

== Pronouns ==

This section doesn't make sense to me:
:Swedish pronouns are basically the same as those of English but distinguish two genders and have an additional object form, derived from the old dative form, as well as a distinct genitive case. Hon ("she") has the following forms in nominative, genitive, and object form:
:hon - hennes - henne
# What's meant by "same as those of English"?
# Why does it say "'''but''' distinguish two genders"? Doesn't English too...?
# Why does it say "additional object form"? What is it added to? Doesn't English have object forms as well?
# Why is only the inflection for "hon" given?
# Isn't it a bit inaccurate to use the term "genitive" rather than "possessive" or something like that, considering the status of cases in Swedish?
I suggest that this entire section be removed from the article. ~ [[User:HannesP|HannesP]] ([[User talk:HannesP|talk]]) 18:27, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:Rather than remove the section altogether, I've tried to tweaked the paragraph for clarity. Switching from the description "basically the same as", to "similar to those of English" will make the section less disputable. I agree that long lists of examples should be removed, but it's therefore quite logical not to provide inflections for all the pronouns. ''Hon'' is merely an example. Full tables can be covered in [[Swedish grammar]].

==Scanian flag==
What relevance does the Scanian flag have in the article? It is grouped together with the Swedish flag to the left and the Ålandic flag to the right to form some kind of Swedish language troika. I am not claiming anything about the Scanian dialects and whether they form a language, are Danish or Swedish, just that it seems odd to use the Scanian flag to represent the Swedish language. Ålandic makes some sense though, but wouldn't the Swedish and Finnish flags do the work?

Hi! Could someone help with the correct [[Wikipedia:IPA for Swedish and Norwegian|Swedish pronunciation with IPA]] of the names ''Robert (Robin) Sanno Fåhræus'' and ''Johan Torsten Lindqvist''?

In the text there is reference to "the spelling reform of 1906".  It's possible that I just missed that, but a quick search on the page for "1906" or "reform" showed nothing relevant.  If there was some official spelling, then I think it should be directly referred to, showing what were the reasons given, what were the differences made, who decided these differences and how was it "policed".

== Romani words ==
There are some words from Romani in Swedish, with "tjej" perhaps the best known. The question is whether the words are many or important enough to be mentioned. There are surely words borrowed from tens of languages, all of which cannot be mentioned. We need a source on the Swedish language mentioning the Romani words as important. --[[User:LPfi|LPfi]] ([[User talk:LPfi|talk]]) 11:03, 14 January 2012 (UTC)

:Dunno, really. But it's a good example of borrowing from a "resident" foreign language which isn't one of the major European languages. It's also a fairy good example of a source language for slang that is today considered common colloquialisms.
:Best way to find out is probably to verify what the source says about it.
:[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 11:26, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
::The borrowings from Romani originated in a manner similar to the [[rinkebysvenska]] of today.

== Where Swedish is "spoken" ==

I doubt the list of countries where Swedish is spoken is entirely relevant. I've written more about it in general at [[Template talk:Infobox language#When is a language "spoken" somewhere?|Template talk:Infobox language]]. In essence, I don't think it is meaningful to say that a language is "spoken" somewhere if it does not have a local tradition in the country. I.e. it gives no more reason to say that a language is spoken somewhere because either a) at any given time there are many tourists speaking the language staying there, b) many exchange students live there, c) many expats live there.

So with the exception of Sweden, parts of Finland and a single Ukrainian village, does Swedish have a local tradition in all of the countries on the list? Is it meaningful to say that Swedish is spoken in these countries? I personally doubt it. [[User:Njardarlogar|Njardarlogar]] ([[User talk:Njardarlogar|talk]]) 18:27, 14 June 2012 (UTC)
:I don't think the Ukrainian village is meaningful to mention. It's way too minor. [[User:Wakuran|惑乱 Wakuran]] ([[User talk:Wakuran|talk]]) 19:42, 14 June 2012 (UTC)

:The Ukrainian village is entirely irrelevant in my view, simply because there are virtually no native speakers. The 10,000 figure is nothing short of exaggerated. The figure is by today down to no more than 50, or perhaps even just a handful of elderly people.
:The other figures, however, seem fairly relevant. Expatriate communities of several tens of thousands aren't exactly what I would consider insignificant, especially the ones living in the US, UK and Spain. And as far as I understand, these statistics don't include tourists.

== Final word on Noarootsi official Swedish ==

I have been in touch with Noarootsi Parish through their official e-mail address and asked whether Swedish is in fact an official language there. Their reply was prompt and to the point:

"Swedish is not an official language in Noarootsi. Official language is Estonian, as it is in Estonia.

Sincerely ,

Annika Kapp

Parish leader

Noarootsi Vallavalitsus"

I know that a website source has been actually provided to support the statement, but I quite frankly don't consider it reliable. It links to Noarootsi's official homepage, but there is absolutely nothing there about official status for Swedish. Despite the fact that nordic.org claims otherwise, I'm removing this fact, because it's obviously based on some kind of misunderstanding or rumor without any supporting evidence or explanation.

Unless someone objects, I will remove Noarootsi from the infobox and add a hidden comment instructing editors not to add that fact again without first checking with Noarootsi Parish.

This piece of text is deficient: '''mannen i grå kostyms hatt; "the man in a grey suit's hat"''' This sentence construction is colloquial and is used only in relaxed spoken language.

== Scanian Swedish origins from Danish and the by Sweden forced renationalisation process ==

Wasn't Scania Danish until 1658, followed by decades of wars between Denmark and Sweden until 1711 ?
Does this really need sourcing ? Do user Peter Isosalo deny that Scanian sound different, uses a continental "R"
and is not built upon standard Swedish, but as of the renationalisation of Scania ? Why do people speak Swedish at all in in the ex-Danish province, that still is just 4 to 100 km away from Denmark (depending of from where in Scania to where in Denmark You use a Craw flight's distance) While Finland Swedish is spoken of perhaps 100.000
- all at Åland and as minority in a few other Finnish cities, Scanian Swedish is spoken by most of the province's
1.3 million. Even immigrants adapts to Scanian Swedish if living in Scania - not "standard Swedish". Please do specify what You really think needs sourcing. [[User:Boeing720|Boeing720]] ([[User talk:Boeing720|talk]]) 06:40, 18 March 2013 (UTC)
:I don't speak or understand a Scandinavian language, so I am pretty clueless about the facts. Maybe I can help anyway.
:I guess that Peter Isotalo has two concerns. One is probably that an encyclopedia article must ''summarise'' the available information, and cannot give disproportional space to specific subtopics except sometimes by way of example for expositional reasons. In this case, much of what you want to add is already present in summarised form: "some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages." On the other hand, Finland Swedish and Rinkeby Swedish have their own subsections. If you want one for Scanian, you will have to explain it's not just a random regional variety.
:The other point is sourcing. In principle, ''every'' claim made in a Wikipedia article must be supported by a reliable source rather than personal experience. In practice, the standard is significantly lower for articles in an early state of development, and then becomes higher as it matures. This article has Featured Article status, so the standard should be pretty high. On the other hand, it got this status in 2007, so in practice there will be a lot of unsourced information here and even more where it's not clear from which source it comes. As a result, there is a constant threat that the article will lose its status.
:Are you aware that there is a separate article [[Scanian dialects]]? I think a good strategy would be to extend and improve that article first, if necessary (using reliable sources). And then, if there is a consensus for adding more on Scanian here, to summarise the relevant parts of that article and give the same reliable sources. According to that article, some see the Scanian dialects as a separate language. If this is not just some non-notable fringe idea, it could be sufficient reason for a more detailed treatment here.
:If you are scared by the prospect of having to format your citations, just don't worry about it. You can just write descriptions in parentheses, for example, and then someone else will likely format them for you. For books, provide page numbers. [[User talk:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] 11:33, 18 March 2013 (UTC)

:(edit conflict) Finland Swedish has a separate section because it's a separate form of Swedish that has evolved outside Sweden. Linguistically, it is far more distinct and unique than any form of southern Swedish, despite the Danish roots of the latter. The whole complex issue of "renationalisation of Scania" and the events related to the Dano-Swedish wars of the 17th century are inherently political issues, not linguistic ones. As for [[Standard Swedish]], basically all regional dialects are included in the definition today. Only very isolated or rural dialects are excluded, and all of those who speak these type of dialects today are fluent in one or several regional forms of Standard Swedish. That means that Scanian is actually considered Standard Swedish, at least by linguists. What you're refering to is actually Central Standard Swdedish, the standard language that is dominant around Stockholm, and to a great extent national media.
:If you want to include information specific to southern Sweden (Blekinge and Halland were just as Danish, mind you), I believe you need to justify it from a linguistic perspective. As for sources, you need to provide at least one [[WP:RS|reliable]] general reference. So far, you haven't presented anything. You should also try to express what you mean in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] and with something like proper linguistic terminology, not merely through simple [[orthography]]. And an example of something you need a much more detailed reference for is the statement about how well Scanians understand Danish. I quite frankly doubt that this is true at all, and even if it is, modern Danish and modern Scanian are linguistically so different from one another that it likely has no relevance in the matter. It's more likely a result of regional cooperation and a higher degree of bilingualism than anything else.
:[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 12:00, 18 March 2013 (UTC)

::To HansAdler. The reason why Scania differs from other dialects (in principal view, not pronounciation) is the very different history Scania (and Blekinge and Halland) has had, and the fact that even after 300 years Scania hasn't moved one inch closer to Stockholm, while Copenhagen is clearly visible across the Øresund. If Peter Isosalo now is so splendid in Phonetics why doesn't hehelp me improve thepart of thearticle instead of erasing it ? SFF hompage is not much, except their citings from well-known Scanian authors. But just like Franco in Spain didn't permit Cathalonian, Peter Isotalo is a spokesperson for some kind of equal Swedish authorithies. (I do not call him facist, but his attitude towards the Scanian question is similar to Franco and Catalunya). The "great king" Gustav II Adolf (known in Germany) has f.i. never ruled over Scania, just burned down thetown Vä, later replaced by Kristianstad (named after Danish king Christian IV) as examples.
So when it comes to '''why''' Scania (and Blekinge and Halland) differs, this should not be too difficult to understand.

:I'll try to reply to these issues one by one:
:*Scanian alone is mentioned, and linked, three times: as "Southern Swedish", "''skånska''" and "Scanian dialects" under "See also". And whether you approve or not, "Immigrant Scanian" is a form of Scanian spoken by native speakers. So it's mentioned more than any other dialect except Central Swedish, but that's only because it has become the dominant [[prestige dialect]].
:*SFF is a political organization with a distinct political goal. It is not an academic institution. As such, it is not a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] when it comes to linguistics. That is not a comment on whether the political goal is good or bad. I'm just saying that they are not recognized as experts by other professional linguists.
:*The "Swedification" of southern Sweden from the mid 17th-century is not really relevant to this article unless you can show how and why it had an impact on the Swedish language. And how it differs from the standardization of other dialects. Because the topic of this article is still language, not political, social or cultural history.
:*As for Stockholm-based conspiracies, you're free to believe whatever you want. Blaming [[conspiracy theories]], however, isn't usually a good idea if you want to get your point across.

It is possibly rather Danish than Swedish, however in SAOL (Word List of Swedish Academy) lots of Scanian word are adapted "sviskon"(katrinplommon),''a dried fruit'', "spann"(hink), ''bucket'', "skoband"(skosnöre), ''shoelace'', "grishals"(karré), ''a certain kind of pork meat'', "hialös"(orolig) ''upset or uneasy'', "mölla"(väderkvarn), ''mill'' - words that very seldom is used outside the ex-Danish provinces - others are not adapted and may hence be spelled in various ways "hode"(huvud) ''head'', kartofflor ''or'' pantofflor/potatis ''potatoes'', brenne/ved ''wood (to burn only)'' etc) Conc. SFF , it's beside the point, but this is not a political party in any sence. But '''of matter is''' that I only did refer to some Swedish books, written at academical level, that SFF simply has made (partial) available in English at their webbsite. So forget about SFF itself. The swedification process had impact on the language in the former Danish provinces. Danish turned during 300 years into Scanian - a new language or dialect. Just like Finland has been a Swedish province (or provinces). I fail to understand what You mean by conspiracy. If the last part of Your contribution is true, why is '''Finnish Swedish''' and '''Immigrant's Swedish''' (mostly Scanian immigrant's is mentioned) of importance. Concerning the latter pleanty of history is included in the article. I have not declined any other dialects to be described, only written about my own accent or dialect.  Eighter all dialects must have a chance to be described - or we have to remove all dialect/accents from theartical. You can not alone decide which is and which isn't worth mentioning. And a final point about phonetics, I'm not the least a shame of just see them as calliography (chinese signs). Even less can I get them into my keyboard. And am not alone of this. An encyclopedia must of course be up to a certain academical level, but not to the point that the readers in general need expert skills in order to understand. I realy belive that (to English readers in general) the phrase "ch-sound as in chocolate" is understood by far more people than a phonetic sign.

== Motivating recent revert ==

I have reverted most of the recent edits by Boeing[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swedish_language&diff=546103495&oldid=545741680] that asked for citations or removed sourced content.

Boeing, if you feel that a certain statement lacks reference support, it's not wrong to ask for one. But if you have a cohesive paragraph that has a reference at the end of it, you should at least ask about whether it supports the entire paragraph rather than ignoring it and placing a reference request after the first sentence. Unless there are very strong arguments for claiming that a sourced paragraph is unreliable, you're strictly speaking expected to look up the source yourself before questioning it.

Also, keep in mind that references are not required in the [[WP:LEAD#Citations|lead section]] since it's a summary of the article as a whole (). If you feel the lead claims something that isn't referenced (or stated) in the article, you're better off simply removing it (but with a reasonably detailed motivation).

Removing content referenced with reliable sources because of personal disagreement is not constructive editing. In these cases, you should motivate yourself in more detail, preferably citing other source that support your own arguments for removal.

==Possesive/Genitive ending/Suffix==
I think that linguistically the 's is not a suffix but an enclitic, so it is probably both more technically correct and more easy to understand for laymen if we use "genitive ending" or "possessive endning". I think genitive is also more technically correct in that it is not only used in cases of possession.  [[User talk:Maunus|User:Maunus ·ʍaunus·snunɐw·]] 17:53, 19 July 2014 (UTC)

:My intention was to introduce a comparing overview of the Swedish language in general, including its advantages and disadvantages with some exemplification. Like I wrote, it was intended to be a start of a such, less formal, less "dry", part. I was expecting some resistance - possibly from You. (But please don't confuse this with our old debate about [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]]). So Please don't take offence. But what do You think was "personal thoughts" ? It's a '''well-known''' fact that Latin and Roman languages (which all are based on Latin) has a far more expressive grammar, especially regarding verb inflections. Where Swedish only has ''infinitive'' and six tenses, f.i. (Castellian) Spanish has three more (infinitive and nine other tenses). And also differ between ''ser'' and ''estar''. This may call for an example - "''<u>Soy</u> sueco''" & "''<u>Estoy</u> en Suecia''" = "<u>Jag är</u> svensk" (<u>I'm</u> Swedish) & "<u>Jag är</u> i Sverige" (<u>I'm</u> in Sweden), both verbs translates to "att vara" (to be), but offer a higher degree of expressiveness - ''to be what'' or ''to be where''. And it's '''equally well-known''' that the strength of the English language is its many synonyms with smaller distinctions. Do You really think such comparissions are unencyclopedical ? [[Per Olov Enquist]] did once explain how Swedish compensates for both its relatively poor grammar and its relatively poor vocabulary (from an academical point of view), and gave the example of how the sentence "Han åt <u>ur</u> gröten" differs from  "Han åt <u>upp</u> gröten" and also from "Han åt <u>ur sin</u> gröt", "Han åt <u>upp sin</u> gröt" (all essentially means "He ate the/his porridge"), he ment the first was the better in this case, and reflected that "Han" (he) is used to, or is fond of eating "gröt" (porridge). While "sin gröt" gives too much attention to ''his porrage'' as such, and also the other exapmles lacked this perticular ''distinction''. ''I think there is a call for a section that covers such issues'', and it can of cource be changed, expanded and given more examples. The contribution You reverted was based on very well-known facts, and hence doesn't require any source(s). I didn't say my version was optimal, but a general section of that kind would be of benefit to the article. It was a start, '''without personal thoughts !'''
:By the way, the 18th Century equals "1700-talet". The wars between Sweden and Denmark (as independant nations) began when [[Gustav II Adolf]], king of Sweden, burned Danish [[Wæ]] (Vä) in 1612 (And king [[Christian IV]], king of Denmark, founded the nearby [[Kristianstad]] instead, in 1614.) The wars ''between'' Sweden and Denmark ended with the peace treaty of 2nd or 3rd June 1720, The third peace in Stockholm. War '''inside''' Sweden during the 16th century ("1500-tal") were not between the Swedish and Danish ''nations'', but related to the [[Kalmar Union]], [[Nils Dacke]], Polish-Swedish king [[Sigismund]] (the offspring of [[Johan III]] and [[Katarina Jagellonica]]) and his uncle [[Karl IX]] and other issues which doesn't involve Denmark as a nation.

::First off, this has nothing to do with previous discussions. I'm not offended, I just don't agree with you.
::Virtually all observations about "poor" grammar in any language are extremely subjective. There is a traditional view that languages with more morphological variation are "richer" while those with fewer are "poorer". This coincides with the fact that classical languages like Greek, Latin and Sanskrit have more advanced morphologies than modern European languages (not to mention highly synthetic languages like Mandarin). All languages are rich in nuances, though, just in different ways. Number of speakers and level of social development is likely more relevant than morphology. Vocabulary is also difficult to say much about with the exception that a very widely spoken language like English likely has more attested words than a far more localized one, like Swedish.
::General observations are not relevant in Wikipedia, especially if they aren't referenced. We're writing an encyclopedia, and we're ''supposed'' to be dry to some extent. The article has a standardized structure with sections where all aspects of Swedish can be described: "Grammar" and "Vocabulary" for example. There is no need for any separate "general overview" other than in the lead. And the lead is a summary of the article as a whole. Comparisons are relevant and I welcome them, but they should be as general as possible. They should be to world languages overall, or at least entire groups of languages (Indo-European or Germanic). And, above all, they should be properly referenced with [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

:::Although perhaps subjective, the Swedish language isn't regarded to have the same expressive grammar as Roman languages, also by its own great authors.

Perhaps there is no English answer to the ''long'' Swedish "y"-sound, like in "Ystad", but the "extra" vowels "
Å, Ä & Ö" I think can be traced in English. Long "Å" like ''a'' in "''alright''", short "Å" like ''o'' in "''other''", long "Ä" like ''ai'' in "''fair''", short "Ä" like ''a'' in "''at''", long "Ö" like ''u'' in "''church''" or ''i'' in "''bird''" and short "Ö" like ''a'' and ''u'' in "''<u>a</u>n <u>u</u>mbrella''" (these examples may be a little depending of which British English accent one compares to) Sorry I'm bad at phonetic signs.

:In Sweden and Finland, a "speaker" of a language means a person with a complete command of the language and a custom to use that language privately. I, for example, speak Swedish and can manage myself even fluently, but I am not a "Swedish-speaker", not even a bilingual because for me, Swedish is not a language of my private life. I am merely a "Finnish-speaker" who can also speak Swedish. Sweden has a large minority of immigrants who don't identify as "Seedish-speakers" in this sense. --[[User:MPorciusCato|MPorciusCato]] ([[User talk:MPorciusCato|talk]]) 13:28, 7 August 2015 (UTC)


:So true, but we know that it is 5% have Swedish as a native language in Finland. That means about 300,000 people. We also know that Sweden has 9.8 million inhabitants most of whom have Swedish as their native language. Should we trust the source as saying that 9.2 million people have Swedish as a native language, it means that only 8.8 million people in Sweden have Swedish as their native language. Sure, there are many immigrants in Sweden but hardly 1 million.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:AbsoluteXP|AbsoluteXP]] ([[User talk:AbsoluteXP|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/AbsoluteXP|contribs]]) 21:12, 7 August 2015 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:::By the '''Swedish''' definition of "immigrant" (being born outside Sweden or having at least one parent who was born outside Sweden, a definition that makes the entire Swedish royal family "immigrants"...), yes. But that figure (which includes both ~60,000 [[Swedish-speaking Finns]] who have immigrated to Sweden, a considerable number of "ethnic" Swedes whose parents temporarily lived/worked in another country when their children were born and a very large number of people with one Swedish parent and one foreign-born parent...) has very little to do with whether they're Swedish-speakers or not, since many if not most of those who by the official definition are categorised as immigrants actually speak Swedish at home, and use it as their first language.

Probably the meant [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf this report], ''Europeans and their langagues'', which says that 93 % of respondents in Sweden had Swedish as their mother tongue. That puts it closer to the 8,840,000 speakers in Sweden that Ethnologue mentions. ([http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/strategic-framework/documents/ebs_386_anx_en.pdf This is the annex] with the tables if you want to study them in detail.)

:[[User:AbsoluteXP|AbsoluteXP]], you are making your own conclusion about language proficiency based on raw population figures. That's basically [[WP:OR|original research]].
:Also, the infobox clearly says "Native speakers", so I don't understand why you'd bring up clearly non-native speakers of Swedish in Finland.

::The [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]], numbering close to 300 000 are [[native speakers]] in the sense used by Ethnologue and the infobox. They must also be included in the Ethnologue figure for "all countries" to reach the number 9,197,090. But adding about 5 million non-native speakers is just wrong, and I agree with your assessment of WP:OR. My guess is that Ethnologue has taken the percentage 93 % multiplied by the latest available population figure to reach 8,840,000 speakers in Sweden. 0.93 x a number between the 2011 and 2012 population [http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik---Riket/26046/] will yield 8,840,000. So the number of speakers seems to be about right, but is probably a little higher today because of population growth. But it would be just as much OR to try to calculate a new number based on population growth, so the number should stay until there is a better source or an update from Ethnologue.

== Influences - lacking headline (?) ==

I've once promised PeterIsotalo , to not interfere in this article. However as I was reading a Swedish ecyclopedia, "Svensk Uppslagsbok" vol 26, printed around 1950, article "snabbtåg" (fast trains) , did I notice the word "nonstop" , which I assume would have been something else, before 1945. If beginning with Gustav Wasa and the 1520's, I believe that Sweden (unlike Norway) wanted to be free of word that sounded Dano-Noregian. And possibly removed "vindue" and introduced the German "Fenster" which became "fönster" ("window", which by the way, comes from Old Norse or at least from Scandinavia as "vindue" -> wind-eye -> window). Also new words like "bensin" and "röntgen" was taken from German "Benzin" (petrol) and "Röntgen" (X-ray). During Gustav III (later part of 18th Century), did suddenly French words became popular, but largely 1523-1945 has German been the largest contributor to the Swedish language, also after the Middle Ages. But since that war, has the English language, more or less taken over this position. I just think there ought to be a headline /chapter called '''influences during later centuries'''.

I'm a bit confused by the statement "While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized". This seems contradictory. Shouldn't we at least delete the "spoken and" part to make it "While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist, the written language is uniform and standardized"?

Hallo everybody. Please notice that the English example on the description of short "a" ('"u" in "put"') is clearly wrong, especially since the SAME example is used three lines after for the description of short "o"!

I guess that the English word "what" could be a closer example of a Swedish short "a", but I don't dare to correct the article myself as I don't actually speak swedish. Could someone more skilled than me please have look into it? Regards. Cingar 17:52 Jan 31, 2004 (UTC)

I can understand the reasoning behind disambiguating from "Swedish language" to "Swedish (language)", but I'm not sure that I would venture to undertake such a disambiguation by myself. I recognize a primary value in maintaining a systematic implementation of article names and any change also implies the same for every language articles, including disambiguation of their links. This is truly a gargantuan task. I'm not necessarily opposed to it as such, but any change that is not fully implemented would just lead to confusion. If it is to be implemented, I would like to see it that it is followed through completely. -- [[User:Mic|Mic]] 07:26 May 9, 2003 (UTC)

Martin, regarding the written standard of South-Scandinavian [[Swedish (language)]], you changed ''<nowiki>[[Adjective]]s are typically [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] according to (real) [[gender]]</nowiki>'' to ''...<nowiki>[[sex]]</nowiki>''. I think it's a rather tricky case. You don't write ''Det snälla/snälle barnet'' regardless of if you know the sex or not. You don't even see ''Det snälle gossebarnet,'' but ''Den snälle gossen'' vs. ''Den snälla flickan.'' My impression is that this is a distinction between sex and gender, but of course I might be wrong. A child called ''barn'' is probably thought of as gender-less (but never sex-less). Also the ''gossebarn'' is seemingly gender-less, but the ''gosse'' isn't. This is also what my native Swedish friends seem to believe, although it's of course of limited value what native laymen say regarding their mother tongue. It would be stupid to ask me about German grammar!

You seem to understand this differently. Do you follow any published authority?

best regards!<br>
-- [[User:Ruhrjung|Ruhrjung]] 06:13 21 Jul 2003 (UTC)

: I was just trying to fix links to [[gender]], which is a disambiguation page - I assumed that "real gender" meant [[sex]] in this case, rather than [[gender role]], [[gender identity]], or [[grammatical gender]]. Sounds like I mucked it up - could you fix it to point to the correct page? [[User:MyRedDice|Martin]]

My problem is that I'm a ''student'' of Swedish, not a native speaker. I consider this peculiarity being one (of several) areas which I don't really understand. It would be ridiculous if I tried to correct others' corrections. This is of course further complicated by me being not a native speaker of English, why I am somewhat insecure regarding the precise distinctions about ''"gender"'' and ''"sex"'' in English.<br>

I think that Jämska is presumably the variety of Swedish spoken in Jämtland - the area around Östersund. I have never heard of Jemtia - but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist as a word. [[User:David Martland|David Martland]] 13:46, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)

--
Interestingly, this page http://www.ima.mdh.se/personal/lln/jamtamot/dokument/jubileumsskrift1985/js1985_nr07_jamska.html suggests that the correct form for the name of the language used in Jämtland '''is''' in fact '''jamska''' - so I stand corrected. I will try to work out how to do the correction back in the main text.

--
Concerning Jamska or Jämska or whatever (there is no standardized spelling, but the Jamts often seem to prefer "jamska", since the 'ä' is a Swedish letter). Jamska is not the Swedish spoken in Jämtland (to say the area around Östersund is a bit of a stretch, the area is of the same size as Switzerland), linguistically it's correctly classified as a West-Scandinavian language, whereas Swedish is on the Eastern branch. The only reason it is often called a Swedish dialect is a political one; Jämtland happens to belong to Sweden nowadays. "Iemtia" is a Latin spelling of the province name, and one form of it can be seen on the Carta Marina, a Swedish map from 1539 ("Iempihia"). It has never really been used though, and certainly not during the last three centuries.

"Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are mus (mouse)..." I was under the impression that 'mus' was of Latin origin - my dictionary agrees with me on this as well. - X-G, 12:48, 16 Jun 2004 UTC

: Which dictonary are you refering to? Both [[Nationalencyklopedin| NEO]] and [[SAOB]] states that 'mus' is an ancient swedish word and NEO also states that it has Germanic orgin (''HIST.: sedan äldre fornsvensk tid; fornsv. mus; gemens. germ. ord, motsvarande lat. mus, grek. mys med samma bet.'')  --[[User:Martinl|Martinl]] 20:35, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Translated: "common germanic word, akin to latin mus, greek mys, with the same meaning", I.e. that is a common IE root, which hasn't changed in very different ways in latin, germanic or greek.

==Rinkebysvenska==

What most people call "Rinkebysvenska", is just plain Swedish with a few borrowed Turkish words, usually spoken with an accent. I barely consider it a dialect and most certainly not a ''derived language''.
Does anyone disagree? -- Ml, 16 Oct 2004
:No, I fully agree. Although there are quite a number of foreign words from different origins used in the youth vernaculars of suburbs such Rinkeby, Botkyrka and Rosengård that is certainly not enough to call any one of them a "derived language". [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 19:27, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::I think we can all agree that the type of Swedish spoken by first generation immigrants isn't a proper dialect. However, making the same assumption for second or third generation immigrants makes no sense at all. There is no question that even children born and raised in Sweden speak a quite distinct and easily discernable style of Swedish which can't possibly be classified as a mere accent. Syntax (verb placement tends to differ), pronounciation (in particular the quite Arabic-influenced <s>velar</s> uvular fricatives) and vocabulary all differ to some degree or another, which is generally accepted as the criteria for a dialect. I know a lot of people who want to classify these mainly immigrant-spoken varieties as sociolects, but I'm not so sure about that myself. One of the main reasons is that I've heard what looked to me as ethnic Swedes use this style of speech with friends that looked to be decended from immigrants. The fact that you hear different dialects coming out of different part of the country also point to the fact that Rinkeby-Swedish and Rosengård-Swedish should be considered offspring of the respective regional dialects. Sociolect or dialect? I'm not sure, but we're definetly not talking about just accented Swedish. - [[user:karmosin|karmosin]] 01:46, 3 Feb 2005

:::The question of whether these forms of speech are dialects or not is certainly debatable, and there are arguments both for and against. One argument against looking at them as dialects that I think has to be considered is the fact that they don't seem to have a stable vocabulary. To me it seems more like each speaker uses a personal array of slang and borrowed foreign words and there are no standard Swedish words that couldn't be used interchangeably with these. Compare this with Scanian, where you could definitely argue that it "would be incorrect" to use the Swedish ''pojke'' (instead of ''paug''),

:::For clarification, the previous postings were a response to the fact that ''Rinkebysvenska'' was originally listed as a '''derived''' language, and not a dialect. Regardless of the discussion of it being a dialect or not, I think we can agree that was incorrect.

== Attention Estonian nationalists! ==

There is an ongoing debate over at the Swedish wiki about whether there are enough Swedish speakers in Estonia to merit an inclusion in the language template. I've slapped the [[sv:svenska|Swedish language article]] with a POV-warning and asked for a reliable source on the number of current speakers. The Ethnologue puts the figure at a whopping [http://www.ethnologue.org/show_country.asp?name=Estonia 29], none whatsoever in the Ukraine and there are plenty of Swedish articles about the Estonian Swedophones that clearly indicate that the number was way below a few thousand as [[sv:estlandssvenskar|early]] as WW II.

Either come up with links to some groundbreaking studies or stop reinserting info that has no merit. I'm too familiar with the concept of Swedish-Estonian nationalism to let this slide. --karmosin 00:49, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)

== Allophone ==

Ruhrjung, I didn't quite understand your objection. The two sounds are in effect allophones, even if all dialects and regional variations except the northern and Finland-Swedish make that distinction in speech. Why doesn't it make any sense? [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 09:47, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)

:After the text
::''The pronunciation of [[vowel]]s, and of some consonant sounds (particularly [[sibilant]]s), demonstrates marked differences in spoken [[high-prestige varieties]].'' 
:Ruhrjung had added
::''This includes in many dialects, including that of the capital area, the [[Voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative|voiceless dorso-palatal and velar]] [[fricative]] {{IPA|[&#615;]}}, (pronounced somewhere between "sh" in English ''she'' and "ch" in German ''doch),'' that in most of these dialects must be distinguished from the [[voiceless retroflex fricative]] {{IPA|[&#642;]}} (pronounced somewhere between "sh" in English ''she'' and "ch" in German ''ich).'' In other important dialects, the same opposition is rather differently produced.''

:You changed 
::''that in most of these dialects must be distinguished from the [[voiceless retroflex fricative]] {{IPA|[&#642;]}}'' 
:to 
::''that in most of these dialects must be distinguished from the '''[[allophone|allophonic]]''' [[voiceless retroflex fricative]] {{IPA|[&#642;]}}''
::(my emphasis).

:So, why ''must'' allophones be distinguished? Aren't they rather much unconciously produced and perceived; and when one is produced for the other, usually no harm is done.

:If {{IPA|[&#615;]}} and {{IPA|[&#642;]}} are allophones of the same phoneme in ''most of these dialects,'' then there is no reason to write about it at all, an it could be removed, couldn't it?

:However, in my book {{IPA|[&#615;]}} and {{IPA|[&#642;]}} are allophones of ''different'' phonems, the sje-phoneme and the assimilation of /r/+/s/.

== Standard Swedish variations or dialects? ==

I think we need to start clearly defining the difference between Swedish [[dialect]]s and the regional variations of Standard Swedish. The term ''rikssvenska'' should be defined in a separate article, and we should avoid confusing popular notions of what the word actually means with the linguistic definitions, which are hardly as vague as are implied in this article. It should certainly be noted that there are misunderstandings of the term among the general public, but it should only follow after a thorough explanation of the linguistic definitions.

The sources I've checked seem to be quite clear and unanimous on the matter. A Swedish dialect is defined quite seperatly from the regional variations.

Here are some citations, my translations from Swedish with my comments enclosed in brackets:

from [[Nationalencyklopedin|NE]]'s article '''rikssvenska''':

:'''''rikssvenska''', the Swedish national language ["riksspråket"]. It has mainly developed from the upper class language of the Mälar Valley region. It can no longer be attributed to any certain regions. The word is used commonly among both laymen and scholars.''

from NE's article '''riksspråk''' (roughly "national language):

:'''''riksspråk''', a form of language that is common to one state [actually Swedish ''rike'', which would roughly translate to "realm"] which is constrasted to dialects. Usually refering to both spoken and written languages. (...) Today the term standard language is the most common in the scientific litterature.''

Both these articles in turn link to the article "standardspråk" ([[standard language]]) and a further defining of "riksspråk" mainly as a term for standard languages in general as well as refering to Standard Swedish.

Engstrand, Olle, "Fonetikens grunder", 2004, pg. 120:

:''All languages have more or less significant regional variations in pronunciation. In Swedish there are differences in the spoken varieties of the standard language ("Scanian", "Gutnish" or "Dalmål") as well as variations specific to certain cities ["stadsmål"] like "Stockholmska" or "Göteborska". By "dialect" Swedish dialectologists are refering to those ''bygdemål'' or ''landsmål'' that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct "National languages" like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.''

Since the linguists seem to be quite clear that "rikssvenska" is more or less the same as "Standard Swedish" and that this term is by no means as rigid and chauvinistic as a lot of our articles here seem to hint at, I think we should start the article [[Standard Swedish]] where we can explain these matters properly. [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 14:44, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)

:May I remind you, Peter, that this seems to be a repetition of our recent discussion in [[:sv:Diskussion:Svenska#Sveam.E5l|:sv:Diskussion:Svenska#Sveamål]]. It would be nice if the confusions from that discussion could be avoided this time.

:I'm not sure, but I would guess that it was no later than the 19th century. Before that I'm not sure Swedish orthography was all that standardized.

==Minor rewrite==
I simply removed the Trivia-section in my latest edit. The category doesn't fit with the standard recommended by the Languages Project and a lot of the facts were either non-encyclopedic or very speculative.

A lot of the rewrite is based on the discussions at [[Talk:Standard Swedish]] and [[Talk:Swedish phonology]]. If anything something important got lost, just give a holler and we'll sort it out. [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 10:27, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

:A few questions about your rewrite, Johan:
:*Wouldn't at least a table of the phonemes be a good idea? Moving the sje-example also doesn't seem to have much of a point since there already is an example at [[Swedish phonology]]. As far as I know it is recommended that a minimum of sound samples be placed in language articles.
:**Why? You have yourself created a specific phonology-article. I would however be prepared to move back the phonology content again. --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:26, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:*The removal of the passage that explains the "u"-vowel to be unique for Swedish and Norweigan was explained with this edit summary: "removing nationalist proudness". Could you explain how it is nationalist to claim that a sound is unique for a particular language? Is the fact actually contested (by any sources)? Will speakers of other languages feel less proud of their own language because they're missing that particular vowel? Is the "u" a particularly prestigious vowel among phoneticians? Labeling comments about unique features as nationalism (on the sole basis that I happen to be a native speaker) just doesn't seem like a valid objection.
:**Without going into too much details, there is no need to appear too much bragging about alleged uniqueness. It looks pretty childish to me. And the allegation is obviously hard to prove. You are however misinterpreting me when you (this time) believe it has anything with you personally to do. Not at all. I would have the same opinion regardless of who had written it, although I may have tempered my edit somewhat differently if it was a student of Swedish who had made the proposal. --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:26, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:*The melodic accent is as far as I know not too unusual a feature in the UPSID languages. I guess that it's probably not too common among the top 100 languages, but that doesn't seem to be a good way of judging if a feature is unusual or not. 
:**Yes it is. English speakers and other students of Swedish as a foreign language are likely to be more acquainted with the more common languages than with the less common. --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:26, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:*I wrote the history section specfically for the introduction. Introductions are as far as I know intended to be fairly comprehensive, if still general enough to be brief. The actually history section has a lot more room for information than just that brief summary.
:**As you see, I disagree with your judgement. I think the history-information is relevant in a history section, when there now exists one. That's where a reader would look for it. In my opinion (and that's what it is: your and my opinions!) Your history-content took far too much of the space of the introduction. --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:26, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:*In general, we have a lot more room in this article. I don't think we need to limit ourselves all that much here considering that most sections are still very brief.
:**Also on this point I disagree with you. In fact, I think [[User:Graculus]] had a good manifesto &mdash; although I came to disagree very much with one of his attempts to implement it. --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:26, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC) 

:I've noticed I didn't explain everything that I changed on the talk page, but then again, I didn't see it as particularly controversial. I'll do a full summary of my edits on the talk pages from now on. Do you thin you could do the same? [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 18:48, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)

== "Melodic accent" ==

I added some information and rephrased a lot of the Sounds-section. The term "prosody" is probably better to use, and there seemed to be a confusion in the old version about vocal stress in general. All forms of Swedish have melodic accent, it's just not the same in all varieties. Finland-Swedish, however, does not differentiate between accents 1 and 2 as do all (I think) varieties in Sweden.

I don't think we want too many subsections either, and in since we should be fairly brief about stress, it's better to stick to just "Stress". [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 15:42, Apr 16, 2005 (UTC)

:The [[melodic accent]] is one of the features of Swedish that is most distinctive and best known abroad. The exact wordings and layout of the article can of course be discussed, and inaccuracies ought of course to be eliminated, but it does not at all seem advisable to "stick to just 'stress'".

:What's your source for "all (I think) varieties in Sweden"?
:It would also be nice to include an apostrophication or a link to an authorative quote on Finland-Swedish. Can you propose any?
:--[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:03, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::If you want any changes to the previous statements to be supported by quotes, then you might want to think about quoting sources yourself. [[Melodic accent]] seems to be totally void of any source references at all, for example. Especially when it's about issues that are really not the least bit controversial. 
:::After all, it's you who proposes changes to texts and wordings that have stood the test of time. And it's you who often have appeared quite eager to request scholarly quotations from others. Hence I think you have more reason to present support for your proposed changes than do others have for conservativeness. I am sure you will understand this basic principle some day, in case you don't do this already now. 

:::With regard to Finland-Swedish, specifically, you may be interested in [[Non-native pronunciations of English#Finnish]], given that you agree that some of the basic difference between Finland-Swedish and ''[[rikssvenska]]'' can be explained linguistically by a Finnish substratum. 

:::You may also consider the difference between providing a link as a means to convince other wikipedians of your point (on the talk page), and to provide a attribution of a point of view to an authority (in the actual article). For the former, googling is useful, for the latter: not so much. 
:::--[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 14:49, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::But here goes:
::*[[Melodic accent]] seems like a somewhat nonstandard phonetic term that could mean anything that has to do with either stress or acccent.
::**Inasmuch as it is a feature alien to English, this is true. Textbooks on linguistics I've read (English textbooks, that is) have also been more concerned about "proper" [[tone language]]s, i.e. the wellknown examples from the Far East.
::** See also the introduction to the article on [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[Non-native pronunciations of English#Swedish]]. --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 14:49, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::* All varieties of Swedish can stress syllables in a number of ways to achieve a number of differences in meaning, but not all use accents 1 and 2 to seperate homonyms, see Garlén (1988) pg. 138-139, Elert (2000) pg. 130-33. and Engstrand (2004) pg. 186-192.
::**I agree with your wording here, and I hope we agree that grave and acute accent in Swedish do not express "stress". --[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 14:49, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::*The Swedish term used by both Garlén and Engstrand is ''ordaccent'' ("word accent") where words are seperated only by the use of either accents 1 or 2. I'm not 100% what this corresponds to in English, but just "melodic accent" is too vague.

::Let me know if you need summarized quotes of these sources.
::[[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 13:10, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)

:::Summary:
:::Reference to ''melodic accent'' is a good thing, "stick to just 'stress'" is illadviced.

:::I don't think we disagree much with regard to the situation in Swedish. The issue is how to express this in English. (Or if at all.) However, as I've already hinted at, it's far too brave to allege that <u>all</u> varieties in Sweden should differ from Finland-Swedish like this. It doesn't seem likely to me, and decreases the credibility of the text. I guess none of the sources you refer to has the guts to be that bold.

:::Nor does it seem like a good solution to be too specific about the situation in Finland-Swedish - unless we have a good source to rely on. 

:::May I also make the clear reservation that I am pretty unsure of which of Elert's works I've read? ...and I do for the moment not recall to have read any work by any Bolander at all - but that may be due to faulty memory.

== Swedish language(s) ==

The article says the following about some of the Swedish dialects:

:"''[[Gutnish language|Gutnish]]'', ''[[Jamska language|Jamska]]'', ''[[Scanian language|Scanian]]'' (''Skånska'') and ''[[Dalecarlian language|Dalecarlian]]'' (''Dalmål'') can in their own right be considered as separate languages. Practically all speakers of these languages are bilingual in Swedish, and the consideration here is principally the dialect of ''Swedish'' spoken by these individuals. None of them are recognized as separate languages under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. ''See also: [[Minority languages in Sweden]]''"

Jamska and Dalecarlian are proper dialects of Swedish and might reasonably be considered seperate languages, though I don't know what linguists have to say about it. Even Gutnish seems reasonable. The claim about Scanian seems to be extremely speculative, though. The article [[Scanian language]] is far too influenced by regionalist sentiment (use of the term [[Terra Scania]], for example).

I don't really see any value in defining all true dialects of Swedish as seperate langauges, since neither linguists or even the speakers themselves use this definition. The term "dialect" is flexible enough to use in this context and it is far easier than trodding straight into the stagnant rhetorical swamp that is the language/dialect discourse. Going by the linguistic terminology (not our own ''interpretations'' of said terminology) seems the only compromise that wouldn't be confusing for outsiders.

See [[Talk:Scanian language]] for a more specific discussion of Scanian as a seperate language. [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 16:04, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)

== removed hard-to-prove claims ==

The following was removed:
:''The Swedish {{IPA|[&#649;&#799;&#720;]}} has no known equivalent except in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and the fricative [{{IPA|[[voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative|&#615;]]}}] is not known to exist in any other langauge.''
The first symbol is rather cryptic, and North-British speakers may disagree with the claim if the symbol means what I believe it does.

The idea that {{IPA|&#615;}} doesn't exist in other languages is also questionable and really impossible to prove. What can be truthfully argued, is that the <b>symbol</b> is not used for other languages, which is explained by it being a relatively new and obscure addition to the IPA-chart. However, the symbol is used in the literature  for several different sounds, many of which for sure exist not only in other languages, but even in nearby languages. 

To sum it up: this kind of absolute statments are substandard.

/J.O.

:An additional explanation for the exclusive use of {{IPA|&#615;}} is maybe its [[IPA in Unicode#Other symbols|IPA-definition]] as a sound with combined articulation: 
::{{IPA|[ &#643; + x ]}}. 
:/[[User:Tuomas|Tuomas]] 11:08, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::{{IPA|&#615;}} is used for several different sounds when it is indicated to be [[phoneme]] with many different realizations just like /r/, /t/, /k/, etc. Look this up in any phonology. They all use the same terminology and they all follow the recommendations of the IPA. I can assure you that the dicussion at [[voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative]] is not especially helpful in this matter. The whole thing got stuck on a simple confusion of phoneme/phone and then got dragged into the whole Standard Swedish/Swedish phonology-conflict where all logical discussion broke down long ago. The sound I recorded is what the symbol is supposed to represent (with some variations) and you can confirm this with any book on Swedish phonetics.
::Also, you can't reasonably ask for a statement along the lines of "...is not known to exist in any other langauge" to be proved. If you want to question it, you have to prove that it does exist in some other language. Otherwise the sentence is perfectly facutal and NPOV.

::::Sorry for not answering this earlier. I didn't really notice it until now, what with all the bruhaha about [[Swedish phonology]].

::::My pronunciation of the "sje" is by far the most common in and around Stockholm, which is confirmed by Elert in ''Allmän och svensk fonetik''. Engstrand and Garlén both describe the sound with almost the same symbols as Elert, though they don't have actual maps to specify usage. I can't back it up with specific sources, but I'd say it's by far the most common on TV and radio these days as well.
::::I can't be certain of what this more prestigeous pronunciation you heard on tape was, but I'm very sure it was the retroflex /rs/-assimilation {{IPA|[&#642;]}}, which is probably a lot easier for foreign students of Swedish to pronounce than the quite unique {{IPA|[&#615;]}}. Any native Swede that uses {{IPA|[&#615;]}} would probably produce a {{IPA|[&#642;]}} if asked to speak very formally. Otherwise the use of it is limited to the northern varieties, to some older (especially upper class) speakers and to effeminte gay men. I think Johan Magnus mentioned the latter phenomena much earlier in our discussion as a Swedish equivalent of an American English [[gay lisp]].
::::[[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 07:45, May 12, 2005 (UTC)

:::::I had this discussion in mind while listening to Swedish news on radio, and I now understand you mean! Though I'm still fairly sure that most lower-to-middle class Central Swedes are fairly close to my pronunciation (or at the least most people my age), I noticed that on radio the pronunciation is, just like you said, more sibilantic than mine. This is in fact the pronunciation my mother has, which I had thought was due to the fact that she's an academic and not originally from Stockholm, but it probably has more to do with age than anything else.
:::::Here is what it sounds like when pronouncing the word ''sjuksköterska'' ("nurse"): {{Audio|two_Swedish_sje-realizations.ogg|listen}}
:::::The first realization is produced by pushing the air through almost clenched teeth. The second one is (as far as I can tell without the means of analyzing it properly) some sort of velar obstruction with pursed lips, which I guess would mean it's labial to some degree (<sup>w</sup> in the IPA symbology). How the first sound is produced, I don't know and don't have the phonetic training to analyze, but it feels far more frontal, even alveolar. However, the tip of the tounge is ''not'' involved as in the English or German {{IPA|[&#643;]}}, but obstructing in a manner I simply can't analyze and that feels far more diffuse than any of the other sibilants.

== About removal of text ==

I noticed that a some text has been removed with the motivation that there are seperate articles for this. This is a fair assumption, but it's not a good idea to remove material without actually moving it.

Unless it is flat-out wrong, don't remove text by claiming the article is too long. In the matter of the immigrant varieties, I'm note sure if it's appropriate to simply move fairly relevant information on a quite interesting aspect of the Swedish language. Considering that FA articles on languages like [[Russian language]] and [[Portuguese language]] are extremely extensive in comparison, it would seem odd that Swedish would have to be so minimalist in information, even when there are seperate articles for certain subjects. I recommend discussing the removal of any information that is not actually erroneous on the talk page, and if it is removed, that the information is moved either to another article or at the very least its talkpage. Some duplicate information must be tolerated in any encyclopedia, and especially in such a general article as this. [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 13:39, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)
{{talkarchive}}
== Pidgin Swedish ==

The heading "Immigrant varieties" has now been changed to "Suburban pidgin varieties". I can see the underlying reasoning for the change, but the argumentation faulters somewhat. All kinds of [[pidgin]] languages are always spoken outside of where the original language is spoken natively. Even though the suburbs of Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg are to great extent non-Swedish in terms of language, they are not comparable to former French, English or Portuguese colonies in Africa or Asia. The assumption that the grammar of Rinkeby Swedish is simplified seems very tentative to me. If anything I would say that the grammar is different, and actually describing it as simpler is taking somewhat of a leap. Most of the claims about inherent linguistic simplicity of true pidgin languages are usually based on subjective ideas of what sort of what "simple grammar" actually means. Considering that Rinkeby Swedish is often spoken by young people who have ethnically Swedish parents and mentioning in the article that it is bordering a pure sociolect, it seems as if actually calling it a pidgin language seems like stretching the definition of the word too far. [[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 11:55, May 1, 2005 (UTC)

:I do partly agree, but must say that this heading is to prefer over for the previous choice. Then, of course, there are even longer possibilities. What would you suggest?

:When discussing the issue of ''"simplicity'' of grammar", it has to be kept in mind that there is an in this respect important difference between creole languages and [[contact language]]s.
:--[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 12:19, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::What's wrong with simply "Immigrant varieties"? It's short, simple and very descriptive. At worst I'd say that it's a very slight generalization. Despite that "immigrant" (''invandrare'') is often somewhat controversial as a term in Sweden, it's not the least bit controversial in English and is a very accurate description.
::I don't think the identification of Rinkeby Swedish as a creole can actually be made when the speakers socialize and live alongside with speakers of the "native" language and when so many are native speakers of Swedish themselves. There might be quite a lot of segregation, but kids being raised completely isolated from other types of Swedish is most likely very rare. The vast majority of the speakers still intermix with ethnic Swedes to some extent and are at the very least exposed to the standard language through TV, radio and the press.

:::# far from all immigrants feel any affinity,
:::# many speakers are "second or third generation" immigrants, and thereby technically not immigrants at all, and finally since
:::# it's not restricted to immigrants but rather to speakers of a certain age of certain neighbourhoods that are densely populated by immigrants.

::::I can't help agreeing with you. How about we try building on this by going with the least complicated subsection heading and concentrating on the wording instead?

:::::Nope. It's more Swedish than English to expand immigrantship for generations. I therefore (and for other reasons listed above) re-worded the term "Immigrant varieties".
:::::--[[User:Johan Magnus|Johan Magnus]] 15:07, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

The only Swedish issue here is the assumption that the term "immigrant" has a distinctly negative connotation. The variety is still spoken mainly by the children of first-generation immigrants (with the exception of Finns or Finland-Swedes). This term is obviously merely a descriptive convenience rather than some illicit generalization and replacing it with completely erroneous terminology like "pidgin" doesn't make it any clearer. If anything, I'd say that calling it a creole is far more likely to draw assumptions from non-Swedes of the speakers being "outsiders" (or, God forbid, "colonials") speaking some form of Swedish not actually intelligable to native Swedes.

== Swedish dialects and Standard Swedish ==

I rewrote the section on Swedish dialects, since the old version still tried to describe the popular notion of what ''riksvenska'' and dialects are instead of focusing on the actual linguistic definition. I've tried to describe these popular notions as best as I can, and I don't wish to supress them, but I will insist on that we stick to how dialectologists define the situation, since it can only confuse outsiders by describing the popular (but usually uninformed) notions as somehow being more "correct". If anyone feels I removed something that still fit perfectly even with the new text, please try to integrate it with the new text rather than just reverting to the old one or merely returning the old paragraphs intact.

Due to the fact the problems with the definitions of Swedish dialects as seperate languages by [[SIL]], which has resulted in a consensus choice to move [[Scanian language]] to [[Scanian (linguistics)]], I have also hidden the following comments:

:":¹ The more genuine varieties of ''[[Gutnish language|Gutnish]]'', ''[[Jamska language|Jamska]]'', ''[[Scanian language|Scanian]]'' (''Skånska'') and ''[[Dalecarlian language|Dalecarlian]]'' (''Dalmål'') are exceptionally considered as "separate" languages in their own right. Practically all speakers of these languages are then to be considered bilingual in Swedish, and the consideration here is principally the dialect of ''Swedish'' spoken by these individuals. None of them are recognized as separate languages under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. ''See also: [[Minority languages in Sweden]]''
:² Jamska belongs to the group of (Insular) West Scandinavian languages, as opposed to the other dialects of Swedish which belong to the (Continental) East Scandinavian group. The proper name of the language is Jamska, though the spelling ''Jämtska'' is sometimes used."

I seriously contest the information here, especially the division into East and West Swedish, though I welcome discussions on this matter. As with previous discussions, I would like to see sources that support any claims of this sort if they are to be included in the article. I hope to hear many opinions on this matter and I hope we can all refrain from starting yet another revert-fest. :-)

== Glottal stop in Swedish ==

There's a claim about "stød", or [[glottal stop]] occuring in some dialects of Scanian, but with no kind of reference. Considering the notions of many that [[Scanian (linguistics)|Scanian]] could be considered a dialect of Danish, I suspect this notion has come along for the ride. Using a glottal stop instead of accent 2 is a distinctly Danish feature, so I'm surprised that it would be present in a Swedish dialect. It would be very helpful if at least the location (with some sort of reference) of these archaic dialects could be mentioned.

[[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 08:25, May 15, 2005 (UTC)

:Since I really want to push this article to the level of an FA, and since the [[Wikipedia:What is a featured article|criteria]] for an FA demand that it adhere to the standards set by the appriopriate WikiProject, it should stick to their standard.

:::But by all means, I welcome the discussions at the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Language Template|template talk page]].

If anything, the layout is definetly not an issue of systematic bias, but rather a pure meta-wiki issue. As long as the sections look the way they do (with all headers below "==X section==" looking too similar and sections with more than two sub-levels making the TOC look quite messy), I'd really like to keep it the way it is now.

==Old Norse vs Runic Swedish==
Even [[Nationalencyklopedin]], which uses the term ''Runic Swedish'', says that there were no differences between ''Runic Swedish'' and ''Runic Danish'' until the [[12th century]]. In order to avoid that people misconstrue the use of ''Runic Swedish'' as signifying that it was an independent language at the time, I think we should use the term Old Norse for this period.--[[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 11:50, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

== History ==

I removed some additions concerning the power struggle between supporters of [[Sten Sture]] and [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]]. It doesn't really seem all that relevant to mention this in a Swedish language article, and I must point out that the circumstances surrounding the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] are pretty sketchy. There are (according to [[Nationalencyklopedin|NE]]) no first hand sources on heresy trials that led to the executions of some 100 former Sture-supporters. This event was also skillfully used by [[Gustav Vasa]] as anti-Danish propaganda in his bid for the Swedish crown. Considering that [[civil rights]] as we know them were non-existant in 16th century Sweden, it's difficult to speak of innocent victims when it comes to power struggles. Christian II was certainly not the first, last or worst monarch to conduct purges of political opponents. 

[[User:Karmosin|Peter Isotalo]] 22:20, May 16, 2005 (UTC)

::I suspect that the independence of the new Swedish monarchy from Denmark probably accentuated the differences in the two languages, but I'm fairly convinced that this has been exaggerated in later history writing due to nationalistic tendencies.
::I found a very interesting quote in the NE article ''danska'', in the section on prosody where an unknown author from the 16th century is quoted on a description of the Danish "stød" in this way:

In fact, this suffix is still extremely productive even to this day in making new verbs.

== Prosody ==

Isn't it a bit confusing that the section on prosody links to [[acute accent]] and [[grave accent]] although these articles does not even mention this particular meaning of these terms? Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about this could add a section to these articles about this meaning?

Also, in my opinion, this section should definitely have a link to the article [[melodic accent]]. I'm aware that Peter has raised the question of the term's accuracy over at its talk page, but although another name might be better suited, not linking to the specific article on the phenomenon seems rather strange. / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 11:37, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:We could just de-link the two accents or perhaps start seperate articles for [[accent 1]] and [[accent 2]] (or just a joint article for both). Do you feel anything is missing in the actual description in this article, though?
:As for linking to [[melodic accent]], I strongly disagree, since it has no proper references. As far as I can tell "melodic accent" seems to encompass only Norwegian and Swedish prosodic features which is not a valid linguistic analysis to begin with. It seems to be merely a slightly better wording of "sing-song prosody" and encompasses not just [[stress (linguistics)]] but also the [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] word accents (accents 1 and 2). When [http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&q=%22melodic+accent%22&btnG=Google-s%C3%B6kning&meta= googling] for it, hits concerning the prosodic feature seems to be mostly our own mirrors and one or two sites on Scandinavian languages (without proper references), but the great majority of the hits seem to be about some sort of feature of music, which ''do'' seem to have proper references [http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/huron.accent.abstract.html].
:Unless the content of [[melodic accent]] is actually confirmed by proper linguistic sources, I feel that linking to it would make this article [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|unverifiable]], since it is either some sort of over-simplified [[neologism]] or just [[Wikipedia:Original research|original research]].
:I'm certainly not an expert on Swedish prosody, but from what I've read so far I doesn't seem possible to sum Swedish prosody up with just one term, since it contains several different features that need to be described seperatly to be comprehensible to anyone who doesn't already knows a lot about Swedish.

:: We probably could link to it in lack of anything better. The proper term for it? Don't know. This is from [[Minnesota]]: ''sing-songy Scandinavian accents.'' Cute, isn't it?

:::The point is that it's not a single, uniform feature and should therefor not be summarized in one single term. It's just a non-linguistic definition that actually means something completely different in musical (and psychological?) context.
:::What is described in [[melodic accent]] is actually called ''tonal word accent'' and this was first recorded in the 1920s by the German linguist Ernest A. Meyer in his two volume-work ''Die Intonation den Schwedischen'' ("The Intonation of Swedish"), and systematically described in Eva Gårding's ''The Scandinavian Word Accents'' (1977), based mostly on Meyer's material.

I've taken out part of a sentence on [[Gammalsvenskby]] in the section "Swedish speaking minorities":
::''which survived until the [[Russian revolution]] when its inhabitants were deported to Sweden in [[1929]] in the purges of the [[Stalin]] era.''
I don't think what happened could be classified as outright deportation. As the article on the subject says, it was the villagers who pleaded for the right to leave the country, actively supported by a Swedish movement. Some later chose to return to the Soviet union (where they were indeed severly affected by the [[Great Purge]] of the Stalin era, which took place in the 1930s rather than in 1929).

:I strongly recommend not attempting such direct translations of specifically Swedish terms. This is a scholarly term that works in Swedish because of the very slight phonemic contrast to "nysvenska" (just a single vowel). I suspect that there is academic wordplay involved in "nusvenska", which works very well with Swedish, what with the tendency for compound nouns. "Present Swedish", however, doesn't work in English since there is no equivalent phonemic contrast to "New Swedish"; it just sounds contrived...

To me, "Now Swedish" is exactly such a direct translation of a specifically Swedish term that you advise against. I would suspect that a native English speaker percieves "Now Swedish" as more contrived than "Present Swedish" or (perhaps even better) "Current Swedish". Is the possibility of translating this wordplay into "New" and "Now" really more important than using idiomatic English? (Consider the fact that the contrast does not work in other languages.

== ''"Du-reformen"'' ==

Shouldn't the section on Modern Swedish have something of the abandonment of the second person plural pronoun "Ni" as a formal mode of address in the late 1960s - ''"du-reformen"''? After all, this was a rather controversial instance of language reform. / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 10:57, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

:"Ni" was never the proper formal adress in Swedish. It was introduced on trial in the early 20th century in an attempt to model the French "vous" and German "Sie", but wound up being used to adress only people of lower status, like cab drivers and was just slightly less insulting than "du" ("you"). The proper formal adress was '''always''' the title and family name of the person. "Herr", "fru" or "fröken" (mr, mrs, ms) seldom sufficed. You had to know the occupation, military rank or academic title of the person you adressed; ''professor Gradin'', ''bankdirektör Karlsson'', ''inspektör Ehrenius'' etc. It was required for everyone to keep very close tabs on everyone else's social status and was one of the reasons it was finally abandoned. The idea of a formal "ni" is a modern construction, and only sporadically used by younger people who work in the service industry.

:But you're right. A short summary would certainly be very interesting in the "Modern Swedish" section.

::::The NE articles mentions it, and I think the idea behind the usage is close enough despite the slight difference in the choice of person.

Anyway, if German is going to stay as an example, ''"An attempt to replace this system with Ni (the standard second person plural pronoun) as in German or French in the early 20th century was not successful and it was rather used as slightly less insulting form of du, mostly to people of lower social status."'' should be rephrased (the sentence is also way to long). I'd suggest: ''In the early 20th century an attempt was made to replace this system with a personal pronoun, as in German and French. But the use of Ni, the standard second person plural pronoun, as a formal mode of address never gained popularity. Rather, it was used as slightly less insulting form of du, mostly to people of lower social status.''

This would also have the benefit that the subject could be allowed to grow freely. / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 14:28, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

::Duplicating longer sections is generally Not A Good Idea, since its hard to keep two parallel versions "in sync", leading one (or both) to lack important additions.
::My main concern is readability. If I'm looking for a specific piece of information it's much easier to find if the page aren't immense. This from [[Wikipedia:Article size]]:
::In the past, technical considerations with some now-seldom-used browsers prompted a firm recommendation that articles be limited to a maximum size of precisely 32KB. With the advent of section editing, and the availability of upgrades for the affected browsers, this hard and fast rule has been softened.
::However, do note that readers may tire of reading a page in excess of 20-30 KB of readable prose (tables, lists and markup excluded). Thus the 32KB recommendation is considered to have stylistic value in many cases; if an article is significantly longer than that, then sections probably should eventually be summarised and the detail moved to other articles (see Wikipedia:Summary style). For most long pages division in sections is natural anyway; even if there is no "natural" way to split a long list or table, it should be done anyway, to allow section editing.
::The current article is 46KB. I simply think it might be time to discuss what belongs in an overview and what is suited for specialized pages. / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 15:47, 24 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I think you're getting the priorities a bit mixed up, Alarm. I totally agree that article size can be a major problem in Wikipedia. Anything over 50k, for example, should be trimmed. This article is comparable to a lot of other language articles and certainly not extreme in size. Readability is something that should be kept in mind, but I just don't see that this article is in anyway difficult to take in; it has good structure and each section and subsection is of decent size and scope. I don't mind adding more details to the sub-articles like [[Swedish grammar]] or [[Swedish dialects]] (yeah, I know it's a redirect) but I don't think we need to cut down on the size as it is right now. It's well-balanced and has a very good general coverage of all the important aspects of any language.
:::If anything I'd say that we're forgetting about the average reader. I really don't think the anonymous non-participating user expects to go to an article about a language to find only the barest minimum of information and links to the "real information".
:::And as for trimming the dialect-section or the map; ''not a chance''. It's probably the best part of the article due to the map (which was a specific PR request) and the sound samples (it's what language is all about) and the current list represents the major dialect groups very well without going into ridiculous minutiae. Removing just a handful won't make much of a difference but it will make the list a lot less complete; removing an amount that would actually matter for article size would just ruin it.

I've never said that we should strip the article to the barest minimum of information and links to the "real information" - that would certainly be stupid. But despite it being rather well balanced, I do think that the article might be on the verge of being longer than what is optimal. And when I say that, I'm thinking precisely of the average reader's possibility to easily access the information at hand.

:::::Take it easy? You're threatening to maim my darling here! :-)

When it was featured on the main page, it was down to 40k [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_language&action=edit&oldid=5517875], but only at expense of ''the entire phonology section''. Right now the article is of very questionable quality. Some sections are good, but Grammar is completely subpar and Sounds still hasn't recovered from the brutal trimming; they're both just bare-bone, minimalist summaries. My rough estimate is that it would take at least another 10k to get it to decent quality, but probably closer to 15k, which would bring it to something very close to the size of our article.
:::::As for the rest of the languages FAs, they average at around 30-40k with 47k for [[Aramaic language]] (very recent). [[Laal language]] and [[Nafaanra language]] strike me as exceptions since they are most likely not as well documented as the bigger languages.

== Critique ==
Just some general bashing. If you think it sucks, don't bother reading. I don't want "dab" on my back this time. I don't care how other articles do it. Ok here we go. Remember, my sole intention is to hurt everyones feelings. No seriously, I want to give feedback but I may be wrong.

1. is North Germanic Language the same as Scandianavian language? Because I know what the latter is, but not the former. North germanic makes me think German belongs to the category.
2. When I wanted a footnote to "More recent analyse" I wanted to know just what the recent analyses are, and from what time. Have these analyses been done by two-three people or by SIL, and in the 70's? Or 90's? Or last year?

Also, where are the editors of this article from? I'm from Malmö but don't speak a marked Scanian.

::'''<engage lecture mode>'''
::Swedish belongs to the supergroup of languages called [[Indo-European language]]s. There are many different so-called [[phylum|phyla]] of this superfamily of languages, and one of these are the [[Germanic language]]s (others include [[Indo-Aryan language]]s and [[Romance language]]s. The name is as far as I know based on the name of Roman province of [[Germania]], where [[Proto-Germanic]], the ancestor of all Germanic languages is believed to have been spoken some 2000 years ago. The Germanic languages are then further divided into three distinct sub-groups:
::*[[West Germanic language]]s &mdash; [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Frisian language|Frisian]]
::*[[East Germanic language]]s &mdash; [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Vandalic language|Vandalic]], [[Burgundian language|Burgundian]], though the entire phylum is now extinct
::*and finally the [[North Germanic language]]s, which are also known as Scandinavian languages.

::While it is very common to refer to the North Germanic languages as Scandinavian, it is far better to refer to call them North Germanic, analogous to the other phyla, and especially considering that not all Scandinavian languages are actually spoken in [[Scandinavia]]. This can be a tad confusing for us Scandinavians, because the languages are often refered to, even by linguists, as [[Nordic language]]s (''nordiska språk'').
::As for the reclassification from East/West Scandinavian (I guess you understand why "East/West North Germanic" isn't used :-)), it is not at just fringe [[SIL]]-theories. Try a Google search if you'd like. It's quite common terminology among linguists. While the East/West distinction is made on historical grounds and is certainly still valid, the Mainland/Insular division is equally valid because of mutual intelligibility and the heavy influence from East Scandinavian languages on the historically West Scandinavian [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. I don't know how old it is, but I know it's generally accepted.

== Merging sections ==

Having thought about it, I think that Peter's proposal above to merge the section "Swedish-speaking minorities" with other sections, primarily "Geographic distribution", is extremely well-founded - especially since it duplicates some of the information given there. I also note that the subsection below "Geographic distribution", "Official status", contains duplicated info from right above this header. (The sections start with "Swedish is the national language of Sweden" and "Swedish is the de-facto national language of Sweden". There's also "In Mainland Finland, where Swedish and Finnish are the official languages" vs "In Finland, Swedish is the second official language alongside Finnish.") I'd suggest all three sections are merged into one, "Geographic distribution and official status". Here's a draft, where I've removed all duplicate info and also trimmed the sections on Ukraine and Estonia:

::Swedish is the de-facto national language of [[Sweden]], but does not hold the status of an official language (similarly to English in the [[United States]]). It is the first language for the overwhelming majority of roughly eight million Sweden-born inhabitants and acquired by one million immigrants. 

::In [[Mainland Finland]], which for centuries was a part of the Kingdom of Sweden, Swedish and Finnish are the [[official language]]s. Swedish is spoken as a first language by a relatively small minority of about 5.5% or around 300,000 people. The [[Finland-Swedish]] minority is concentrated to the coastal areas and [[archipelago]]s of southern and western Finland. In these areas, Swedish is often the dominating language. In the Finnish municipality of [[Korsnäs]], 97% of the population is Swedish-speaking. In Korsnäs and the municipality of [[Larsmo]], Swedish is the sole administrative language on the municipal level. 

::Since an educational reform in the [[1970s]], both Swedish and Finnish have been compulsory school subjects in Mainland Finland, and until 2004 both were mandatory in the final examinations. Education in the pupil's first language is officially called "mother tongue" &ndash; ''"modersmål"'' in Swedish or ''"äidinkieli"'' in Finnish &ndash; and education in the other language is referred to as "the other domestic language" &ndash; ''"andra inhemska språket"'' in Swedish, ''"[[toinen kotimainen kieli]]"'' in Finnish. 

::Swedish is also the sole official language of the [[Åland Islands]], an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] province under the [[sovereignty]] of [[Finland]], where 95% of the 26,000 inhabitants speak Swedish as a first language. 

::'''Formerly, there were Swedish-speaking communities in [[Estonia]], particularly on the islands ([[Hiiumaa]], [[Saaremaa]] and [[Vormsi]]) along the coast of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of the Baltic territories to Russia in the early [[18th century]], around 1,000 Swedish speakers were forced to march to [[Ukraine]], where they founded a village, ''[[Gammalsvenskby]]'' ("Old Swedish Village"), north of the [[Crimea]]. A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.'''

::'''In Estonia, the small remaining Swedish community was very well treated between the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, had Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden at the end of World War II when Estonia was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. Only a handful of older speakers remain today.'''

::There are small numbers of Swedish speakers in other countries, such as the [[United States]]. Swedish descendants in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] have maintained a distinction by language and names.

::Swedish is one of the official languages of the [[European Union]]. 

I'm not terribly happy with the last, one-sentence paragraph, but I can't find a better solution right now. I welcome suggestions on this and all other aspects on the proposed restructuring/copyedit. 

Also, a few sentences from "Swedish-speaking minorities", namely "Finland was a part of Sweden for some 700 years, and during this period Swedish was the administrative language. In [[1892]], Finnish was given equal status with Swedish, following [[Russia]]n determination to isolate the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from Sweden" should be added to an appropriate part of the History section.  / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 18:40, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:Ok, I got bold again. I simply merged the language minorities-section with Geographic distribution, creating a new Finland-Swedish section and put the rest of the info under the appropriate subsections. As for changing the section structure, it's a very widely used standard and should be complied with as far as I'm concerned. Really long titles for section headers should definetly be avoided, and in this case it's used in most language articles and seems to me as a rather logical one. I'm not entirely sure if Standard Swedish and Finland-Swedish should be seperate sections altogether, but I just don't know where to put them.
:In any case, I made the last reference to the HUI poll, and I'm certainly satisfied with the article as it is now. All the issues raised in the Peer Review have been addressed and if there are further requests in the FAC, I think these could be dealt with without much hassle.
:[[User:Karmosin|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Karmosin|Isotalo]]</sup> 20:45, May 26, 2005 (UTC)

::Ok, so there might be need for the "Official status" section header. But the placement of "Former language minorities" is completely illogical, inbetween "Official status" and "Regulatory bodies". Also, if "Finland-Swedish" is to be placed between "Standard Swedish"  and "Dialects" I'd expect more on the properties of Finland-Swedish, instead of mainly dealing with the distribution and use of it. (Note that your edit kept the duplication of "In mainland Finland Swedish is spoken as a first language by a relatively small minority of about 5.5% or about 300,000 people" in "Geographic distribution" vs "5.6% of the total population are Swedish speakers" in "Finland-Swedish" that my suggestion above got rid of.) I think both "Finland-Swedish" and "Former language minorities" belong directly under "Geographic distribution", because that's what they're about. I'd suggest a disposition along these lines:
*Geographic distribution
***Swedish in Sweden
***Finland-Swedish
***Former Swedish minorities in other countries
**Official status
**Regulatory bodies
**Standard Swedish
**Dialects
::Also, the current state of "Former language minorities" has a rather confusing backwards chronology, that begins with the interwar period and then goes on to the 18th century. Also, I the two paragraphs on the subject I proposed above are slightly trimmed, which in my opinion improves them. Could you possibly consider looking at them again? / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 21:41, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:::Looks like more sub-sections than is actually necessary to me. "Geographic distribution" can cover everything in the current paragraph. What would be the difference, besides creating three extra sub-levels of sub-sections (most of which would contain quite little information)? If it's a problem for layout, I'd much rather move the entire "Former language minorites"-section and put it in "Modern Swedish".
::::It is a question of where the topic logically belongs. If you're principally opposed to using third-level subsections, we can put it all directly under "Geographic distribution". My main point is that most of the text under "Finland-Swedish" and "Former language minorities" belongs right in the section that talks about where the language is spoken. / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 22:38, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
:::As for the properties of Finland-Swedish, it would be very difficult to motivate such coverage unless we started describing the much larger dialect groups of Swedish spoken in Sweden. And then we'd definetly have problem with size. It does, however, seems to be important to explain the political status of Finland-Swedish, since it is quite different from Sweden-Swedish.
::::Actually, that was my point, although I can see I did not express it very clearly. I was merely arguing that with the current placement of the subsection, you might expect that sort of content. It was only intended as an argument for why the topic should be placed directly under "Geographic distribution". I'm ''not'' proposing such additions. /[[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 22:38, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

::::I was ''not'' asking you to consider the whole of the draft but specifically the two paragraphs on Swedish-speaking minorities in Estonia and Ukraine. (I've now gone back and made them bold for clarity.) I edited the original text, and I think it's better than the current text of "Former language minorities" on two accounts: First, they don't start with the interwar period and then jump back to the 18th century. Secondly, as I wrote above, they've been slightly trimmed, which in my opinion improves them. (It got rid of "the long march", avoided repeating "Ukraine" twice, etc.) Just compare them to the current wording, and you'll see what I mean. / [[User:Alarm|Alarm]] 22:38, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

== North Germanic = Scandinavian ==

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about the different terminology for the classification of the North Germanic languages, so I guess I'd just point it out here for reference. "Scandinavian" is just another term for "North Germanic" in this context. "Scandinavian" seems to be used primarily when dividing the five languagages (including Faroese and Icelandic, mind you) into either East and West ''Scandinavian'' or Insular/Mainland ''Scandinavian''. Never "West North Germanic" or "Mainland North Germanic". This is described both in this article and to some extent in [[North Germanic languages]].

"North Germanic" has to do with the division of the [[Germanic languages]], that have three branches, the West Germanic, the East Germanic (all extinct) and North Germanic. In Sweden, the term ''nordiska språk'' — "Nordic languages" — is by far the most common among scholars, but neiter ''skandinaviska språk''or ''nordgermanska språk'' are entirely unknown.

== SIL code ==

It seems that someone takes ISO 639-2 code for Swedish (swe) for the real SIL code (SWD). Pay attention, that even if you download language code tables from ethnologue.com (in association with SIL), they provide ISO 639-2 codes, and so it can't be a reference for the SIL code.

== very bad phrasing ==

"Swedish is notable for having a relatively large vowel inventory consisting of 9 vowels that make up 17 phonemes in most varieties and dialects (short /e/ and /ɛ/ coincide)."

I needed to read this several times and excamine the chart provided to find out what in the world this sentence is supposed to mean, namely that there are 8 short and 9 long vowels.

:It's because the vowels differ in quality, not only in length.

::Actually, short /e/ and /ä/ may coincide in some dialects but I sure wouldn't pronounce e in peng the same way as ä in dämpa. - Daniel Dahlborg

:::They are differentiated in very few dialects as far as I know, and certainly not in Standard Swedish. The difference in the vowels in ''peng'' and ''dämpa'' is quite subtle and most likely due to the differing phonetic context. The first is followed by a [[velar nasal]] and the other by a [[bilabial nasal]]. I'm guessing you don't pronounce ''dämpa'' the way you pronounce ''märka''. The latter is lowered to an [æ] because of the /r/.
:::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 13:47, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

::::I wouldn't pronunce the stem vowel significantly different in the examples given above (''peng'', ''dämpa'' and ''märka''); they would be all approximately [ɛ]. But the ''e'' in e.g. ''bett'', ''vett'', ''sett'' and ''ä'' in ''lätt'', ''tätt'' would be like [e]. Thus, e.g., ''peng'' [pʰɛŋː] but ''lätt'' [letʰː]. As far as I know, in Standard Swedish, ''e'' and ''ä'' are supposed to be denoting the same sound when being short. My pronunciation is regiolectal, or more probable even dialectal, in this sense. (My [ɛ] derives from Old Norse ''e'' or ''æ'' in front of a consonant which is long today, and my [e] from Old Norse ''i'' or ''é'' in front of a consonant which is long today. In Swedish, ON ''æ'' and ''é'' are today always spelled ''ä'', ON ''e'' is Swe ''e'' or ''ä'' and ON ''i'' is Swe ''e''. Obviously, Swedish seems to have had a fundamentally different evolution than my dialect in this sense.)

== Vocabulary ==

What would this mean? "Finland-Swedish has a set of separate terms that are close cognates of their Finnish counterparts, chiefly terms of law and government." I have trouble understanding it completely. Since Finnish and Swedish are unrelated languages with most basic vocabulary being completely different (although Finnish has borrowed thousands of Words from Swedish or Scandinavian during the ages). I believe that these words referred probably either are calques or loanwords from Finnish. Could someone explain this, I would believe these words are [[calque]]s rather than [[cognate]]s.

== Removed an incorrect example ==

Great work, Peter and all others, making this an article to be proud of!

I was looking it over and found one of my own brilliant contributions from way back, which is, strictly speaking, not true:

:''Some compounds are translations of the elements (calques) of German original compounds into Swedish., e.g ''bomull'' from German ''Baumwolle'', cotton (lit. ''tree-wool'').''

Yes, ull=wolle, but to be a [[calque]], I think both parts of the word must be translated literally, and I can't find any evidence that bom = baum.  As far as I know, there's no Swedish word for tree that sounds like "bom".  

So happy as I am that it passed all those reviews from native speakers, I have provisionally removed this example, hoping that someone will either:

* Reassure me that "bom" is indeed a Swedish word for "tree", though perhaps in a dialect or sense I don't know about, or

* Find another German => Swedish calque example that we can be proud of.

Apologies for pulling the ''bomull'' over everyone's eyes for so long!    --[[User:Steverapaport|Steve Rapaport]] 00:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

::Followup: According to my Swedish etymological dictionary, it may be a legal calque after all -- "bom" is "stång" in Swedish and is used mainly in calques from German such as "bomull", "buxbom" and "bomolja". So the example can stand like a stång after all. Comments from real Swedes? [[User:Steverapaport|Steve Rapaport]]

:::Yeah, "bom" is an older term for tree and [[SAOB]] has it recorded in text as late as 1686 [http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/37/9242.html]. I'd call "bomull" a proper calque, but it seems as if pure sound imitation could've played an important part. Similar examples I can think of right now are ''snälltåg'' ("express train") based on ''Schnellzug'' and the proverb ''ont krut förgås inte lätt'', which literally translates to "bad gunpowder doesn't perish easily", where "ont krut" actually is a misinterpretation of the German ''Unkraut''; "weed(s)". ''Snäll'' (today mostly "of good will; nice; pleasant") was used in it's earlier meaning of "speedy" as late as 1971.

== A sentence I find unclear ==

Originally I wrote this in the Swedish phonology talk page, but since I've got no answer so far, I thought I should ask here. In the article on Swedish language, there is the sentence:

Although there are inflection rules to prevent two unemphasized syllables in a row, words may instead have two consecutive stressed syllables.

1. I assume "unemphasized" means unstressed, but why not write so, then? "Emphasis" usually refers to a pragmatic feature, overlapping with logical focus and the like.
2. Examples are needed to illustrate the statement. Does it refer to forms like vinter-vintrar (<*vinterar) and, say, kvarskatt? If yes, I think it should be mentioned that two unstressed syllables actually CAN occur in a row, (fjäril - fjärilar), otherwise people could get the wrong impression. 
3. Finally, I'm not a professional linguist, but I'm not sure if the reason for the inflection rules in question is indeed the "desire" to prevent two unstressed syllables in a row - even though that is clearly the result of them. After all, a vast number of languages have phenomena like English "dif'rent", "Marg'ret", "garden-gardner" etc.. "Preventing two unstressed syllables" would suggest that such a sequence is prohibited, which is clearly not the case. Of course, a scientific source would disperse my doubts. :)

== Diphtongs and West Norse vs East Norse ==

:''A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong æi (Old West Norse ei) to the monophthong e, as in stæin to sten. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin. There was also a change of au as in dauðr into ø as in døðr. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tauþr into tuþr. Moreover, the øy (Old West Norse ey) diphthong changed into ø as well, as in the Old Norse word for "island".''

Actually, the lack of diphtongs is not a feature of East Norse! Indeed, we can find perfectly preserved diphtongs in Gotland, in Finland and in Norrland and until at least 13th, and probably even until 14th, century they for sure existed in large parts of Eastern Svealand as well. (Remember where the swedish speaking finns come from and when they migrated.) I propose that references to East Norse and West Norse are removed here and that one simply mentions that a monophtogisation process occured in Old Swedish. 
A second thing is that it is hardly true that one only had the process ''au'' > ''ø'' as in ''dauðr'' > ''døðr''. (Whatever this means - ''ø'' without a length mark ''´'' or doubling ''øø'' suggests a short vowel here which contradicts the fact that ''au'' was effectively a long vowel.) In large parts of Sweden the ''au'' first turned into a levelled ''öu'' (here ''ö'' denotes [ɔ], i.e. same vowel as in Old Icelandic ''lönd'' 'lands') and then into a monophtong ''öö'' (i.e. [ɔː]). The ''au'' > ''øø'' evolution was a pure danish one which spread northwards, especially amongst nobles and literates (and in the end, though probably quite late, also amongst ordinary peasants).

== South American speakers ==

I hid the statement about South American speakers since the source [http://clvweb.cord.edu/prweb/swedish/ Concordia Language Village] only mentions it in passing and without any sign that they could back the statement up. I'm sure there are plenty of people in South America that have Swedish ancestry, but I feel that it's appropriate to use reliable surveys or statistics as soruces to that confirm that there are sizeable South American minorities that actually speak Swedish before we put it in the article. That CLV puts the figure of Swedish speakers at 10 million, conjuring up about 700,000 speakers that aren't accounted for by anyone else, does not make them seem more reliable. Hence I reverted the figure in the infobox.

And what about Swedish speaking people outside Sweden and Finland? There must be hundreds of thousands of emigrated Swedish speaking persons out there.

:It's fairly safe to assume that the overwhelming majority of people living in Sweden know enough Swedish to reach a figure of close to 9 million, since the language is so dominant, even if you exclude all those English speakers who tend to get away with only speaking English. The biggest problem is judging exactly how many Swedish citizens are living abroad. Does, for example, the official population statistics include all citizens or not? We have official statistics of Swedish-speakers in the US (around 60,000), but there's no way of knowing the exact proficiency of those speakers. The measuring standards of the US Census are highly subjective and largely up to the people answering the questionnaires to decide.

== "Mutual Intelligibility": Nordic Baloney on Steroids ==

This article flatly states that Swedish and Danish are mutually intelligible. Several times. We even get to read that Swedish and Danish are actually dialects of a single language.

This is Nordic nonsense and wishful thinking. It is also an assertion based on academic dogma which has very little to do with the way language is used in the real world. There is a fine Swedish term for this sorry condition: ''paragrafrytteri''.

The simple fact is that the vast majority of native speakers of Swedish, regardless of dialect, can not understand spoken Danish, regardless of dialect. The reverse is also true.

All the yakking in the world about orthography won't change this fact.

Two possibilities: this article is using a defective definition of mutual intelligibility or the speakers in the sample are telepathic. Take yer pick. [[User:Youssef51|Youssef51]] 09:32, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

:You're welcome to nuance the statement, but I would appreciate if you would tone down your ranting. You should also consider basing whatever edits you make on something other than your own very strong opinions. There are many dialects around the world that are far more different from one another than the Mainland Scandinavian languages, but are still not considered separate languages. If it weren't for the existence of three separate nation states with separate orthographies, language regulators, dictionaries, etc. there would probably be just one Mainland Scandinavian language.
:The definition of mutual intelligibility is not set in stone. Neither is it true that most Swedes simply don't understand (spoken) Danish. It's highly dependent on context and something as simple as tolerance for the language with the listener (that is, not just experience of Danish). It doesn't take that much effort for a Swede and a Dane to make themselves understood to one another without resorting to a third language, even if it means speaking a bit slower and a bit clearer. To contrast with an example: the same simply can't be done with for example German or Dutch. Not even if the speakers speak extremely clearly and slowly would it be possible for the average Swede to understand more than a handful of words.

A few simple points:

1) Please document or reference your claim "Neither is it true that most Swedes simply don't understand (spoken) Danish."

2) A first reference for my claim that most Swedes don't understand spoken Danish: I've recently asked more than twenty native Swedish speakers if they understand Danish. All answered "no". I'm sorry I haven't published my research.

3) I speak Swedish on a daily basis. I've given university courses in Swedish. I don't understand spoken Danish.

4) Every conversation I have ever wittnessed between Danes and Swedes has ended up taking place in English or in Swedish. I have wittnessed several comic attempts to speak "Scandinavian" which rapidly gave way to one of these alternatives. When 90% of the intended meaning is falling on the ground ( ''"Va? Va? Va sa han?"'')  people wisely switch languages.

5) Your statement "there would probably be just one Mainland Scandinavian language" illustrates the wishful thinking I refer to above. Please tone down your [[Wishful_thinking|wishful thinking]].

:1) There was a very good survey of how well speakers of Nordic languages understand one another a few years ago, but unfortunately the site that hosted the survey is now gone. The conclusions were that Norwegians udnerstand Swedish and Danish the best, and that Swedes and Danes understand Norwegian reasonably well but have more difficulties with Danish and Swedish respectively.
:2) Asking your friends is not how to reference statements. We rely no statistical surveys or academic literature on Wikipedia, not hearsay.
:3) If you've decided that you don't understand it, then nothing can be done, I suppose. Understanding another language is also to a great extent about making an effort to understand it. I.e. a concious choice to give it a chance. When it comes to judging how well a Swede understands written Danish compared with written English you'd have to be either better at English than Swedish or simply give up in advance and never even try to claim that Swedes can't understand Danish.
:4) Resorting to English probably has more to do with a fear of socially awkward situations (something Swedes according to surveys fear even more than death) than actual lack of understanding.
:5) The beginning of that statement was "If it weren't for the existence of three separate nation states with separate orthographies, language regulators, dictionaries, etc..." and it's an opinion that is held by most, if not all, Scandinavian linguists.

== Three slight problems ==
'''1.''' Regarding the statement: '''"It is currently expected that the bill will be successfully passed if it is put up for a second vote."''' 

Who is "it"? In other words, who is expecting this? Seems like introduction of unnecessary POV. If you want to call it a majority viewpoint, please introduce sources to verify this claim.

'''2.''' Regarding the statement: '''"The linguistic definition of a Swedish dialect is a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse."'''

This statement is too simplistic, if not incorrect. If "linguistics" is referring to old-fashioned "traditional  dialectology", this needs to be stated because this is no longer a definition used in modern linguistic research into dialects, and has hardly been in use in practice at all since the early 1980s. "Separate development" is generally not used as a definition for dialects as they are the spoken language of a living, breathing speech community and few modern societies have enclaves of humans without influences from the surrounding world. See for example a more modern approach to dialects in linguistic research, as applied in the SweDia 2000 project, as explained in a statement by Anders Eriksson, Professor of Phonetics at [[Gothenburg University]], one of the leading scholars involved in the project: [http://swedia.ling.umu.se/faq/faq_swedia_e.html "Frågor och svar om projektet: Är inspelningarna exempel på genuina dialekter?".] SweDia 2000, (in Swedish). For a somewhat different definition, as applied in sociolinguistics, see for example Einarsson, Jan (2004).  ''Språksociologi''. Lund: Studentlitteratur, p.139, where the spectrum between genuine dialect and spoken Standard Swedish is divided into five categories. For a common international definition, see for example Dr. John R. Rickford, Professor of Linguistics Stanford University, [http://www.stanford.edu/~rickford/papers/l73_reading_1.doc How Linguists Approach the Study of Language and Dialect], a document offered students in introductory linguistics classes at Stanford University. 

'''3.''' The article is not clarifying the difference between the [[codification (linguistics)|codification]] of '''written and spoken Standard Swedish''', which is odd considering the long section dedicated to the written standard. As pointed out in the article by Einar Haugen (Professor of Linguistics and Scandinavian, Harvard University, 1964–75) and Jan Terje Faarlund (Professor of Scandinavian Linguistics, University of Trondheim, Norway), who contributed the article "Languages of the subgroup Swedish" a North Germanic languages article in Encyclopædia Britannica Online (2006), a spoken Standard Swedish was not introduced until 1842. (See also a Swedish Television special of 25 Jan. 2006, about the "language hygienic" drive in Swedish schools, a drive aimed to obliterate dialects and enforce "well-mannered" (hyfsat) Stockholm-influenced speech in Swedish schools.

:The information in the articles ''sveamål'', ''götamål'' ''Värmland: dialekter'' in [[Nationalencyklopedin|NE]] and the dialect maps on ''Svenska språket under sjuhundra år'' (see reference section) appear very inconclusive on this issue.

::One source is e.g. ''Kortfattad svensk språkhistoria'' by Gösta Bergman. Bengt pamps ''Svenska dialekter'' would work fine as well. If you want to, I can even contact my dear friend professor Staffan fridell at Department for Nordic langauges, Uppsala university. (I have already employed his knowledge in my correct claim that Old Swedish had diphthongs, contrary to the original incorrect claim of the article on the Swedish language.) Since I know you have a severe tendency of interpreting sourcing in your own way, I would like you to quote and scan your graphical data in NE and ''Svenska språket under sjuhundra år''. Please. You're making the extraordinary claim, so you should provide some detailed extraordinary proof for it.
::As a very simple and illustrating "proof" of the Köla dialect being Götamål rather than Sveamål, take a look at the SweDia transcription pages of the dialect. ([http://swedia.ling.umu.se/Svealand/Varmland/Kola/index.html Here].) Now, as you see, Standard Swedish ''mycket'' (=much) is ''myä'' or ''möe'' in the dialect. Now, this if anything should convince you that it's Götamål. I assume you have a deep knowledge about the differences between Sveamål and Götamål. Götamål ''myä'' (''möe'' etc) corresponds to Sveamål ''mycke'' (''myttje'' etc). The only feature which looks like Sveamål to me is that there is a lack of opened short vowels (''fisk'', not ''fesk'' etc.), but this probably has more to do with the fact that the dialect in question is a transitional Götamål-East Norwegian one. Another explanation is that the dialect speakers have lost this feature recently. (A yet another explanation is that the transcriptioner has interpreted the opened short vowels as ordinary closed vowels - the SweDia transcriptions are far from being flawless.)

== Input requested ==
Hi.  We could use some outside input over at Categories for discussion.  In particular, [[Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 November 1#Category:Finland-Swedish|here]] we have two people arguing over what to call [[:Category:Finland-Swedish]], and another couple of opinions could be very helpful.

== "Dialect" Samples ==
On the one hand, the article says (in the dialect paragraph):
:''The linguistic definition of a Swedish dialect is a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse.''

But on the other hand (concerning the SweDia samples),
:''All dialect samples are from SweDia, a research project on Swedish dialects available for download (though with information in Swedish only),'' [...]

Something is wrong here. Listening to most of the samples (especially the ones from my own province [[Jämtland]], they do not represent "''a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language''", which is "''[the] linguistic definition of a Swedish dialect''". Thus, following this claim, most of the samples do not represent "''Swedish dialects''", but something else. Either we must change the definition of what a dialect is, or we must remove the claim that the SweDia samples represent dialects. The samples represent random speakers from certain areas, but hardly the genuine form of the local varieties of speech untouched by Standard Swedish. What do you think? I request change of terminology here, at least concerning the samples. Should we instead of "Swedish dialects" call them e.g. "local varieties of regiolects"? Of course, a few of the samples reallt represent dialects, so they should be denoted dialects. (Or preferrably removed and replaced by more Standard Swedish samples from the nearby area.)  '''Jens Persson''' ([[User:130.242.128.85|130.242.128.85]] 22:23, 13 November 2006 (UTC))
:Take a look at 2. in Pia's post above. When I wrote the dialect section I had only really read a small section on dialects in Olle Engstrand's book on phonetics, and since I have encountered other views on this issue. For example in books written by Östen Dahl.
:Could you motivate why you switched the dialect sample from Aspås and described it as transitional? [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 10:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
::I switched the dialect sample since the young man better represent dialectal speech, which is what the samples are trying to reflect. I come from the neighbour village (Nälden, which is mentioned in the main text about Aspås), so I know that the young woman more represents the Östersund speech than Aspås speech. But of course, the young male doesn't speak "''a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse''" either. But that's an other issue. (NB: I know the identity of the speaker and his father - who I have met a couple of times - is pretty well-known in Jämtland.)
::The dialects in Jämtland (except the ones in the east) are transitional Tröndish-Norrlandic ones. No dialectologist denies this. They usually state it as "Norrlandic with heavy Norwegian influences" in the literature, though. (Note that I am not one of the fanatics stating that the Jämtland dialects are Norwegian or even constituting an own separate language. I am merely following the mainstream Scandinavian dialectologists here.) I may seem pedantic to you, but I simply want things to be as correct as possible. You'll be able to verify all my claims by reading the sources presented by both you and me.
::I propose we also denote the Bohuslän sample transitional. (East Norwegian-Götamål; this is in accordance with the mainstream dialectology.)
::I didn't notice the debate started by Pia. She's correct in that it's slightly simplistic, but I must say I agree with the definition. But this means that there are very few surviving living dialects today. I don't think dialectologists disagree with me. The local varieties of speech we hear today are varieties of regiolects, e.g. the young female from Aspås speaks a local variety of the Norrlandic subdivision of the Central Swedish regiolect. Remember - I assume you have even written some article about this though not using the term "regiolect" - the Swedish regiolects are South Swedish (Lund), East Swedish (Åbo), Mid Swedish (Uppsala) and West Swedish (Göteborg). The cities within parenthesis are the universities where the region's variety of Standard Swedish were once defined.
::I think it is very important to separate genuine dialects (which are more or less extinct today) and the local varieties of regiolects. Linguists use a system where there are five steps (I think) where the step in one (let's say left) extreme is "''genuine dialect''" and the step in the other ("right") extreme is "''standard language''". The "''neutral regiolect''" would be the step just "left" of "''standard language''", and the samples of SweDia probably typically represent the step just left of the "''neutral regiolect''", let's call it "''local regiolect''". The "''local regiolects''" show some important surviving dialectal features, but mainly they follow the "''neutral regiolect''" in question. Left of the "''local regiolects''" we find the "''diluted dialect''" which is a very inconsistent version of "''genuine dialect''" and "''standard language''". Basically, when I changed the sample, I switched from "''local regiolect''" to "''diluted dialect''". I request that we change "dialect" to "local regiolect" (requires a [[regiolect]] article?) when referring to the SweDia samples in general. But it would take an expert on the subject to actually determine whether the single samples are pure dialect or regiolect. We need to be able to verify that the individual samples actually are dialects or regiolects. That's the problem with SweDia as I see it. It's not consistent in the five step scale described above. Some speakers are purely dialectal (where the genyuione dialect has survived AND the picked speaker happens to speak the dialect) while some are close to speaking neutral regiolect (quite few, though). Most samples tend to be in the middle of the scale, but SweDia should have some kind of comments on how well the samples represent the dialects described in the traditional dialectology literature.

:::Mr Persson, I appreciate your knowledge of Swedish dialects, but jugding from some of your contributions, I really must remind you of Wikipedia's [[WP:NOR|No Original Research]] policy. In some of your suggestions, you are proposing changes of classification based on your own knowledge, not on scholarly literature - and that ''is'' a problem. For example, unless you provide a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] calling this or that dialect "transitional", "a neutral/local idiolect", "a diluted dialect" or whatever, it is against Wikipedia's policies to use these designations. Now, while you might be right in inventing this or that new designation/interpretation, it still may not be included in the article, because '''we have no guarantee that you are right''' (it is not [[WP:V|verifiable]], even if it is the truth).
:::I haven't been following this page and I don't know whether the original classification is based on scholarly literature (I suppose Peter Isotalo ought to know that, if he was the one who added it). If it isn't, it should be deleted as well, or only the uncontroversial parts should be kept. 
:::Concerning the issue about whether these are "original" or "authentic" dialects, it is indeed discussed on Swedia's site (I don't remember where exactly, it's a long time since I read it, so I suggest you find it yourself). Personally, I'd say that switching samples is a questionable enterprise, because it is based on your personal judgement of what is a more or less "real" dialect/local variety. The samples were meant to show the condition of the modern local varieties of Swedish '''as they are''', and they are all equally valid and "real", regardless of how Stockholm-influenced or pristine they are. --[[User:194.145.161.227|194.145.161.227]] 20:57, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
::::You write: "''The samples were meant to show the condition of the modern local varieties of Swedish '''as they are''', and they are all equally valid and "real", regardless of how Stockholm-influenced or pristine they are.''" I agree, but they should not be called dialects but local varieties of Standard Swedish. SweDia's definition is far too politically correct and popularized, and besides it's not in accordance with the article's current definition. (I seriously doubt whether the SweDia project is in accordance with the neutral scientific method. If people here had the slightest insight in dialectology, they'd realize this. Perhaps my feeling of being [[The Trial|Josef K]] here is because I have a deeper knowledge in this specific field than other Wikipedians working on the article.) I am  not sure why I am the one who should provide the specific sources since it is not my claims which are extraordinary.

I saw the Request for Comment and am therefore commenting. I don't know diddly about Swedish dialects, but I'm not at all pleased with the current statement, "The linguistic definition of a Swedish dialect is a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse." The statement is unsourced; who defines it that way? "Dialect" is a notoriously ambiguous term in linguistics, so claiming one definition as "the linguistic definition" is inaccurate. [[John C. Wells]] proposed the term "traditional-dialect" for the dialects of English that come close to that definition, but "dialect" by itself can mean anything from that down to a cluster of similar idiolects within a standard language. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 08:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

===Choice of dialect samples===
I'm attempting to section this discussion so we can discuss each issue separately. Please help me out on this one, as posts are getting very long and ungainly.

My choice of dialects back when I wrote most of the section more than a year ago was an attempt to provide a reasonable number of samples based roughly on the number of speakers and the degree of variation in each of the various dialect groups. I tried my best to compromise between representing as many dialects as possible and not cluttering the map too much. I was trying to be pragmatic. I'm sure that it doesn't fall into the category of "scientific methods", but then again, the purpose of the article is to give basic information on Swedish to laymen and to illustrate variation within the language, not to stand up to scrutiny though it was a scientific paper. I urge you to try to view this from the perspective of someone who doesn't know squat about linguistics or dialects. [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 12:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
:I don't think we should compromise scientific exactness just because most people reading an article like this one happen to me laymen. I might violate Wikipedia policies by valuing scientic exactness (unreferenced or not) higher than than the providing of sources (misinterpreted or not).

===Definitions of Swedish dialects===
I suggest that we start by making brief citations of various scholars and their views on Swedish dialects. Olle Engstrand is already cited in the article, but he's not a dialectologist as far as I know and the page cited is only of a brief summary of how a Swedish dialect would be defined.

Please keep it short and to the point and avoid including too much of your own opinions. [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 12:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
:We are playing with words here, and since the definitons of words tend to be different in different sources, it is a matter of opionion when chosing one path to follow. The important thing is to make the definition of the word ''dialect'' consistent with the samples used in the article. (Unfortunately, it would be original research to validate the samples.) I am sure that we must follow [[Dialect|dialect]] in order to avoid an internal incosistency. Why would the definiton of a "Swedish dialect" be different from the general definition of a [[Dialect|dialect]] here on Wikipedia? The extra thing is of course that "Swedish dialect" of course introduces the adjective "Swedish". That is what needs a source of some kind. Bengt Pamp's ''Svenska dialekter'' may provide an answer. (If it does, it should be acknowledged and valued higher than Engstrand's book since Engstand is no authority on dialectology, but phonetics.)

:In the beginning of the article, it says:
::"''While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized, with a 99% literacy rate among adults.''"
:Here one actually speaks about "regional varieties" vs "rural dialects". The samples are claimed to be (rural) dialects, while anyone who's got some insider knowledge of dialects (being a dialect speaker myself when I have the opportunity) knows that the samples mainly represent what here is called "regional varieties". It is clear that there's a severe inconsistency in the article, mainly caused by the randomly chosen SweDia samples. Shouldn't we simply mention that the samples range from being "regional varieties (of standard Swedish)" to being "(rural) dialects (descended from local varities of Old Norse)", or whatever formulation? This would be simpler than changing the definition of the term "Swedish dialect". '''Jens Persson''' ([[User:130.242.128.85|130.242.128.85]] 20:05, 16 November 2006 (UTC))
:Now when I think about it, why is the article loaded with specific "dialect" samples anyway? Should a general article on the Swedish language actually have such an amount of samples? The best thing would be to remove the samples completely and instead write something about the dialects, the most important general features of Norrländska mål, Sveamål etc. As the article is now, immigrant Swedish is explained in greater detail than the traditional dialects.
:'''Proposition''': Remove the samples and include a brief discussion on the defining features of the different dialect areas.
:NB: I can't find any Wikipedia article called [[Swedish dialects]] (redirection). Does this mean we ought to start one? The Swedish dialects definitely deserve their own Wikipedia article.

::It ''is'' original research. SweDia is a popularized project not intended for scholars but for a broad audience. The point is that SweDia has a very "liberal" definition of a dialect not consistent with the traditional definition used in the article in the same subsection. I will give you the following concrete thing proving that SweDia isn't a very reliable project. Let's look at the following sample transcription ([http://swedia.ling.umu.se/Norrland/Jamtland/Aspas/ym.html Young Male, Aspås, Jämtland]):
:::"''Åä... då såt '''ma''' der å de var, je tro, '''heri''' barn va re. Å... å så sått '''ma''' der å...''"
::which according to SweDia translates to
:::"''Och då satt '''man''' där och det var, jag tror... Ja, '''här i''' baren var det. Och så satt '''man''' där och...''"
::I have high-lighted the flaws of SweDia in bold face. In [[Jamtlandic]], the pronoun ''ma'' translates to Swedish ''vi'' ('we'), not "''man''" ('one') which would be the naïve translation. Furthermore, the Jamtlandic adverb ''heri'' translates to Swedish ''i'' ('in'), not "''här i''" ('here in') which would be the naïve translation. This was just a few sentences from one sample, but I see these flaws in practically every sample for which I have a basic knowledge in the corresponding dialect. These flawed translations are most often due to naïve interpretation of dialectal words. Another very striking example is this ([http://swedia.ling.umu.se/Norrland/Norrbotten/Overkalix/om.html Old Male, Överkalix]):
:::''"Döm kånn äint huri ne jer oppa '''vättnen'''..."''
::which SweDia naïvely translates to
:::"''De kan inte hur det är på '''vatten'''''"
::Here, ''vättnen'' is the dative of ''vättne'', so the correct translation would be the definiet ''vattnet''. (Remember, SweDia is supposed to provide a very literal translation with explanations as notes below the texts.)
::Of course, I am not alone in this critique of SweDia. My point isn't to say that the SweDia samples are irrelevant as samples of rural everyday speech, but I a can't take the project seriously, i.e., I don't consider it to be scientific, but popular. And I don't think Wikipedia should value popular material higher than scientifically rigorous material. Thus, since the SweDia definition of a dialect is not in  accordance with the definition of a dialect (consistent with the scholar literature) already in the article, it would be original research to call the SweDia samples dialects.
::So far, I haven't seen anything to back you up, mr Isotalo. '''Jens Persson''' ([[User:213.67.64.22|213.67.64.22]] 16:33, 17 December 2006 (UTC))
:::SweDia is used by scholars in its unedited form. They have more and longer samples available for researchers. The webpage is intended for a broad audience, but so is Wikipedia. This is not a scholar forum.
:::And what can I say? You're still trying to remove an entire section because you have personal quibbles with the intepretations. You're not even quoting Pamp.

::::It's not the sound samples of the SweDia which is the problem, but rather how they are used in this context. I am working on a more descriptive dialect section based on the classification found in ''Svenska språket under sjuhundra år'' by Gertrud Pettersson. I will adapt some isogloss maps. You can control the final result by borrowing the book at some library. The reason I use this book is because it is published by Studentlitteratur, which I trust as a scholastic source. (I have some friends who have published books there as well, e.g. [http://www.studentlitteratur.se/o.o.i.s/2474?artnr=32472-01 ''Rumtid - en introduktion till Einsteins relativitetsteori''] by Sören Holst, theoretical physics lecturer and a former colleague of mine at Fysikum, Stockholm university.)
::::The greatest reason for removing the samples is that they take too much space. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to take one sample from the "core" (following Pettersson's book above) of each dialect area and skip the huge map? The huge map and the ridiculous amount of samples is simply not necessary. I am surprised noone has ever argued against the way the dialect section is constructed. It's far too heavy and free from interesting information about the dialects.

:::Jens, your very radical rewriting of the dialect section is in some ways useful, but it is also extremely partial to a certain interpretation which does not enjoy much support among Swedish linguists. The idea of the "genuine dialect" is today seen as overly conservative and rigid by many prominent linguists. The dialect samples from [[Svenska Dagbladet]], with which you have replaced the ones from SweDia are all of people who aren't even alive today. And all of this because you personally don't like their choice of informants. There's still no attempt to prove that your stance reflects academic consensus. The latest sample is from 1982, and the oldest from 1950s, and all of them of very elderly people. This does not accurately reflect how people speak Swedish today, which is one of the prime concerns of this article. You've also removeed (!) a perfectly valid and accurate citation of Engstrand and replaced it only with a general reference to Pettersson.
:::And I would like you to stop calling me "Mr Isotalo". [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 12:04, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
::::Of course, you're free to improve the current version by reinstating the Engstrand citation, if necessary.
::::The problem with the SweDia samples isn't that they are too modern, but that they are not consistent. Some of the samples are very close to Standard Swedish, some of them are very close to the traditional dialect.
::::I agree with you and everybody who claims that the traditional dialects aren't very interesting for Modern Swedish. In fact, the rural dialects can not be said to be Swedish at all, rather local varieties of the gerenal Mainland Scandinavian super-language. This is of course why all isogloss maps show at last both Norway and Sweden.
::::I can only see two solutions: (1) Slightly improving the current (i.e., my) version of the dialect section. (2) Rewriting it completely by chaning the name of the section to '''Local varieties of Swedish'''and not referring to the SweDia samples as dialects but to as ''Samples of local varities of Swedish''. You simply can't go against centuries of traditional classification of what a Swedish dialect is. So far, you're the one who committing original research. I have simply put Gertrud Petterson's (ultimately the linguist Elias Wessén's) treatment of the Swedis dialect into the article. So, you don't agree with Petterson (Wessén)? I am sorry, but I will never accept the former version of the dialect section. Either you come up with some non-original reserach text, or you let my version be (with slight improvemnets to "Wikify" it a bit more.) '''Jens Persson''' [i.e., non-logged-in ''Hunef''] ([[User:213.67.64.22|213.67.64.22]] 14:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC))
::::I have reinstated the SweDia samples by calling them Modern Dialects. Can we agree on the general set-up for the dialect section now? Feel free to improve some details, but I think that the current version is quite good. It's a good compromise, I believe.
::::Note that the most important improvement with respect to the earlier version of the article is that the traditional classification system (''Götamål'', ''Sveamål'' etc.) is not used on the modern dialect samples of SweDia,  since that would be utterly meaningless. Ther traditional classification system can '''only''' be used in a meaningful way on the traditional dialects. If have everr looked closer on the SweDia homepage, there is no traditional classification system there. They only organize the samples with respect to province, not with respect to  the old classification system. '''Jens Persson''' (i.e., ''Hunef'') ([[User:213.67.64.22|213.67.64.22]] 15:13, 26 December 2006 (UTC))
:::Jens, there is no original research involved in the selection or dialects and you should stop making false accusations because they are false and exaggerated. There are minor uncertainties in the classification of one or two of the selected samples and the description needs to be nuanced with other opinions, but certainly not more traditional views. Pia made some very appropriate comments above and if you want to improve, you should take inspiration from those instead of insisting only on your own interpretations.
:::SweDia tries to treat all forms of Swedish fairly equally as far as I can tell. They're missing info about the various city dialects, which deserve as much treatment as any of the rural ones, but otherwise they've tried to include as much as possible. I don't agree that we should start labeling dialects depending on how traditional they're perceived to be. ''They're all dialects.'' What should be provided, though, is information that there are forms of speech which are more or less divergent from Standard Swedish. But that still doesn't justify making sweeping and highly biased statements about what to define as a dialect or not.
:::Views on classification change all the time, so there's usually no one version that can be considered correct and final. I spoke to Östen Dahl a few weeks ago about this issue, and he explained that the consensus today has moved away from the separation of "genuine rural dialects", even if its recognized that many of them are in some sense very archaic. This has also been mentioned by professor Lars-Gunnar Andersson who appears on the weekly [[Sveriges Radio|SR]] radio program ''[http://sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/program/index.asp?programID=411 Vetenskapsradion Språket]''. And I'd say that the old dialect groups are still quite applicable to what you call "Modern Dialects", even if the differences between individual communities tend to be smaller than before. Even Swedes with no knowledge of linguistics or dialectology know of ''småländska'', ''värmländska'', ''pitemål'', etc. That they're not as unique as they might have been 50, 100 or 300 years ago doesn't change the fact that they're readily identifiable to most Swedish-speakers.
:::No dialect really remains static and even the most conservative of communities have been influenced by the standard language in one way or another. [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 12:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
::::Of course, I don't disagree on much being said here. But I don't think that the earlier version of the dialect section is consistent with what you say here. In the article, there was a veri strict definition of the term ''dialect'', especially that it has no influence from Standard Swedish. This is the core of my objection. We can't claim that the samples of SweDia are ''dialect'' with this definition of a dialect. What we obviously need to do is to change the definition of what a dialect is, i.e., a much more liberal definition of the kind ''any geographically localized variety of Swedish''. Don't take this wrong, it's somewhat an insult to dialect speaker of the traditional kind to claim that the highly Standard Swedish influenced SweDia sample from their parish is ''dialect'' in the article's sense. The fact that most people don't speak the traditional dialect doesn't mean that the traditional dialect is extincted. In each rural parish, you'll find a range of varieties of speech being spoken from the most traditional dialect to the most standardized Standard Swedish. SweDia randomly picks a variety of speech which indeed is more dialectal than the weighted average in the parish in question, but still quite far from the most pure dialect ''still'' spoken by a few.
::::The consensus must be that we either have two subsections (Traditional ''and'' Modern Dialects) '''or''' one section with a highly liberal and modernized definition of what dialect is. In this definition, there will be no classification into Götamål, Sveamål etc. since it simply has no meaning for varieties close to Standard Swedish. Compare with the classification system for West vs East Norse which only worked until Old Norse times. After Old NOrse, one needs instead a mainland vs Insular Norse classification. We simply can't apply an old classification system to modern dialects. In e.g. Jämtland the typical speech of today does not fit into being a ''Norrländskt mål'' (there won't be many agreements with the table in the current version of the article), so one can't label a sample from Jämtland as belonging to the ''Norrländska mål'' category. The same applies for 90+% of the samples.
::::'''Proposition:''' Give a liberal definition of a dialect and keep the current label-free version of the SweDia samples. The map with the numbers speaks for itself. '''Jens Persson''' ([[User:213.67.64.22|213.67.64.22]] 22:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC))
:::Yes, the solution is to assign a liberal definition of what a dialect is. This does not, however, justify the trumping of any choice of dialects, especially not the kind spoken by elderly informants recorded 20-40 years ago, all of whom are most likely dead. As for the classification scheme, you're free to use sources to prove that "modern dialects" are somehow above and beyond the old classification and that they're fantastically free from the shackles of categorization. But if you can't prove it, it should be included. It could easily be supplemented with comments and perhaps combining the current numbered dialect map with color-shading for the dialect areas. I suggest you start cleaning up the additions you made containing the misleading information about traditional vs modern. You should also reinstate the content that cited Engstrand. There is no problem in combining this content with other views on dialectology.
:::And, again, I really urge that you start the article [[Swedish dialects]], since a lot of the very detailed information you want to include doesn't really fit this already rather crowded main article.

::::So, suppose we assign a liberal definition of what a [[Dialect|dialect]] is. Then, due to the "''Law of Shift''", we must also have a liberal definition of what a [[Language|language]] is. Ultimately, this means that a dialect according the non-liberal definition (i.e., as in e.g. Wessén's book) is a language in the liberal definition of a dialect. Or?
::::I think this question is too complex for amatuers like us, [[User:Peter Isotalo|mr Isotalo]], especially you who haven't even studied dialects on a shallow level. We would need an expert on dialectology to write the section on dialects. The dialect section is not wrong ''per se'' as it is now (I assume you agree with me here), but it is obvious that we some disagreements how to write it. My proposition is to contact several dialectologists to supervise the project.

What is a language anyway? Why is Norwegian a seperate language? It is mutuallly intelligible to Swedish. By the way, have you ever heard anyone speaking Jamska or anyone from Ekshärad? [[User:Aaker|Aaker]] 22:15, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I have heard [[Jamtlandic]] on TV and I had no problem understanding it.  There is two ways of defining language.  One is language as a social construct: a variety defines itself as language by creating it’s own rules of writing.  However, by this definition there would not be any non-written languages.  The other way is as a group of mutually understandable dialects.  I myself use the first definition for written language and the second for non-written ones.  That is how I can come into the justification of the [[Corsican language]] yet deny that [[Scanian]] is a language of it’s own.  But I can quite understand [[linguists]] who use the second definition only.  2007-03-10  Lena Synnerholm, Märsta, Sweden.
:You heard it on TV. With all due respect, that doesn't mean much. A friend of mine claimed the same, but in the end it turned out he just heard a Jamt speaking Swedish. The speakers of Jamtlandic also speak Swedish, which they use with people who doesn't know the former. I'm born and raised in the province and there is some variations even I can't understand. There is, by the way, several standards of writing Jamtlandic. I have also encountered a number of local dialects along the Norrland coast and inland which are basicly unintelligible to me.  [[User:Hubert82|Hubert82]] 08:40, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::Language talent varies widely among people.  You might have considerable difficulty to understand some Swedish dialects especially if people talk inarticulately.  Yet I have never had any such problems except for [[Elfdalian]] which I consider an own language.  When I heard Jamtlandic on TV it was a program about Jamts paying tribute to anything Jamtlandic.  Why would they not speak as they normally do?  If there is no mutual agreement on how to write Jamtlandic it is not a language of it’s own.  I wonder if your argument about “several standards” is not an attempt to explain away disagreement on how to write it.  Is any of those standards markedly more common then the others?  If not I would not count any of them as a “mutual agreement”.  2007-06-22  Lena Synnerholm, Märsta, Sweden.

Modern Continental West Germanic languages (German, [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/kost006dutc01/kost006dutc01_001.htm Dutch], Frisian) as well as [http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/ling/copil/Vol1/biberauer.pdf Afrikaans] and [http://www.hum.au.dk/engelsk/engsv/papers/stuttgart/vikner-stgt4.pdf Yiddish], are often considered [http://books.google.com/books?id=8QX50Vddm-gC&pg=PA331&lpg=PA331&dq=sov&source=web&ots=Y7DmAaIZ3g&sig=NGbWbR7f7Dw8fJg6fLuu9TVtT5E#PPA331,M1 Germanic SOV languages] by various scholars, so obviously the statement as it appears in the article is simply too categorical. See also the Wiki-article [[Luxembourgish_language#Word-order|Luxembourgish]].

Also, for the record: I disagree with [[User:Peter Isotalo]]'s implication in that edit summary that in order to request a source or a fact check, users here will have to present some kind of scholarly support to explain why the request for clarification is made.

== Mutual intellegibility with Icelandic? ==

I'm a native Swedish speaker, and I can't understand a word of Icelandic. Say, German, is closer to mutually intellegible with Swedish than Icelandic in my opinion (not saying that it is). Can any other native Swedish speaker confirm or deny this? [[User:Dingbats|Dingbats]] 07:07, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
:Mutual intelligibility is not something that is either true or false and the article says "to some extent". Understanding other languages is also to a great extent something that has to do with attitude. That you would never be able to understand a single word of Icelandic is obviously not true unless you had actually decided not to try. That it's not as easy to understand as Norwegian or Danish doesn't mean that it's 100% gibberish.

To 99% of the world's population "mutual intelligibilty" means you actually can have some normal conversation going with the two languages. In the case of Swedish and Iceland, this is not possible (unless the speakers learned the basics of pronounciation of the opposite language, which makes it a *lot* easier, but that's besides the point). This is an encyclopedia; any other definition of mutual intelligibilty may fit for academical linguistics, but not here. [[User:Hubert82|Hubert82]] 08:40, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

It does however lack people of the undefined term "ethnic Swedes" that's not used officially. Also, ethnicity is not measured so there aren't any statistics available to back up this statement. - [[User:Masken|Masken]] 12:17, 26 August 2007 (UTC)
:Whether it's immigrants who flock to certain suburbs or white Swedes running away from the (very often non-white) immigrants, it's still segregation. Anyone who has ever set foot in Rinkeby knows that something like 80-90% of people there are Arabs, Kurds, South Americans, Serbs, Chinese, Viatnamese, etc. A statement about the exact extent of the segregation would indeed require a precise source, but merely claiming that there are rather few white ethnic Swedes in Rinkeby is not in the least controversial or even likely to be challenged.

::Segregated is not the correct word in this case.  From the [http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&va=segregate Merriam-Webster dictionary], segregated means:
:::'''1''' : to separate or set apart from others or from the general mass : ISOLATE
:::'''2''' : to cause or force the separation of (as from the rest of society)
::Segregated has very strong negative connotations that imply that the people who live in Rinkeby were ''forced'' to settle there, which AFAIK is not the case since many have ''chosen'' to live there.  Since claiming few white ethnic Swedes live in Rinkeby is more correct, I'm changing the text to match that. [[User:Panda|panda]] 14:41, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== Colon ==
I added the part about the colon because i kept seeing it at the main page of http://www.europa.eu/ . I guessed the meaning, but couldn't find any clear explanation at this article. I finally found it at [[Colon (punctuation)]]. Even if its use is marginal, it still should be mentioned here.

I think the text about the colon could use some examples and/or be further explained.  Looking at ''Svenska skrivregler'' (2nd ed, 2002, p 154-156), the colon is used:
* before citations:
:: ''Leende frågade han: "Är du alldeles säker?"''
:: ''Hamlet: Att vara eller inte vara, det är frågan.''
* before a question or statement:
:: ''Frågan är: Vem avgör vad som är sanning eller lögn i denna sak?"''
:: ''Mitt förslag är: Gratis cyklar åt alla!''
* for examples, explanations, specifications, and summaries:
:: ''Du skall ha tre valsedlar: en gul (riksdagsval), en blå (landstingsval) och en vit (kommunfullmäktige).''
:: ''Nu förstod jag plötsligt: mannen var blind.''
* in certain expressions with numbers and abbreviations:
:: ''10:50 kronor (tio kronor och femtio öre)''
:: ''Job 14:1-3 (Jobs bok, kapitel 14, vers 1 till 3)''
:: ''Land 1998:3 eller Land 3/1998 (nummer 3, 1998)''
:: ''skala 1:50 000 (skala ett till femtiotusen)''
:: ''1:a (första)''
:: ''S:t (Sankt)''
* for stating the time:
:: ''klockan 13:10, tiden 1:40:02''
* for all types of suffixes that can be added to numbers, letters, abbreviations:
:: ''4:e gången (fjärde gången)''
:: ''54:an (femtifyran)''
:: ''linje 10:s väg (linje tios väg)''
:: ''första a:t i apa''
:: ''tv:n (televisionen)''
:: ''vd:ar (verkställande direktörer)''
:: ''FN:s (Förenta Nationernas)''
:: ''IOGT:are'' (member of IOGT)
:: ''Karl XII:s likfärd (Karl den toftes likfärd)''
:: ''förf.:s, förf:s (författarens)''

(Examples are from ''Svenska skrivreglar''.)  I believe the last one was the one that [[User:Amire80|Amir E. Aharoni]] was interested in. [[User:Panda|–panda]] 21:18, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:Keep in mind that this isn't [[Swedish alphabet]], an article which is only marginally longer than the section on the same topic here. The bulk of these examples would also be especially tedious as they don't really differ much from how the colon is used in English.  [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 21:31, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
::That's why I specifically mentioned that the last one is probably the interesting one.  Also, the first example is different from English since a comma would normally be used, but that's such a minor difference that it may not be worth mentioning.  Probably not all of the examples should be included but more than one example makes sense since the current text is confusing:
:::"In Swedish orthography, a colon can appear inside words in a manner similar to the English apostrophe, between a word (or abbreviation, especially an acronym) and certain grammatical suffixes, mostly the genitive ending -s."
:: Also the text stating:
:::"It also occurs in certain names, for example Antonia Ax:son Johnson (Ax:son for Axelson)."
:: is an example of an abbreviation (e.g., ''förf:s'') and doesn't necessarily have to do with a name.

::[[User:Panda|–panda]] 22:16, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:::Thanks for the examples.
:::Of course only those which are unique to Swedish should appear. On this page a couple of examples would be enough and a detailed list can be on [[Swedish alphabet]].

:::''1:a (första)'' and ''S:t (Sankt)'' are special, and so is ''10:50 kronor (tio kronor och femtio öre)'' (in most languages it would be something like 10.50 or 10,50).

:::And of course the last part is pretty unique. --[[User:Amire80|Amir E. Aharoni]] 08:38, 22 October 2007 (UTC)
::::When you say "the last part is pretty unique", do you mean ''Ax:son'' or the last set of examples I gave (starting with ''4:e gången'' and ''54:an'')? [[User:Panda|–panda]] 15:38, 22 October 2007 (UTC)
:::::Everything from ''4:e gången'' to ''förf:s''. --[[User:Amire80|Amir E. Aharoni]] 07:56, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

So how about this then:
:In Swedish, the colon is used with numbers (e.g., ''10:50 kronor'' = ''tio kronor och femtio öre'' = "10 kronor and 50 öre"), for abbreviations (e.g., ''1:a'' = ''första'' = "first", ''S:t'' = ''Sankt'' = "Saint"), and all types of suffixes that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations (e.g., ''53:an'' = ''femtitrean'' = "the 53", ''första a:t'' = "the first a", ''tv:n'' = ''televisionen'' = "the television").

I don't know if you had any specific examples from the last group that you thought were especially important to mention.  The above text may also be clearer in tables, which I can create if you think it would help. [[User:Panda|–panda]] 17:43, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

::::: Good that we both agree it has nothing to do with grammar.  My example:

:::::is as short as the current text and is not a bulleted list.  I would also argue that it contains more useful examples which are, in fact, not that similar.  ''Ax:son'' is a very special case that isn't at all useful for someone learning Swedish.  We can removed the ''1:a'' example if you really want since I've added that to [[Swedish grammar]], but all of them are common examples used in everyday writing and signs.

::::: Since you don't seem to be convinced that the current text about the colon is confusing, let's evaluate it piecemeal:
:::::: ''a colon can appear inside words in a manner similar to the English apostrophe, between a word (or abbreviation, especially an acronym) and certain grammatical suffixes, mostly the genitive ending -s.''
:::::* The most common ways to use an apostrophe in English are with the [[genitive]] and for [[contraction (grammar)|contractions]] (such as "won't"), and the colon is not used for contractions in Swedish.  I would personally just not compare it with English unless you want to compare and contrast all of the different ways in which the colon is used in English and Swedish.
:::::* "in a manner similar to the English apostrophe" and "mostly the genitive ending -s" would imply that "Peter's" would be written ''Peter:s'' (incorrect) instead of ''Peters'' (correct).
:::::* "a colon can appear ... between a word (or abbreviation, especially an acronym) and certain grammatical suffixes" would imply that it can ''not'' be used with all grammatical suffixes.  That's actually incorrect according to ''Svenska skrivreglar''.  Also stating "abbreviations, especially an acronym" is incorrect since it has as much to do with numbers, letter, and abbreviations as acronyms.
:::::: ''It also occurs in certain names, for example Antonia Ax:son Johnson (Ax:son for Axelson).''
:::::* This is a single, very unusual example about how the colon is used, which is mostly useless for someone learning Swedish.  The chances of someone hearing about [[Antonia Ax:son Johnson]] are very slim and the interest in her seems to be very low as both the Swedish and English articles about her are very small.  Also, unless you can come up with another example, the text is incorrect as it implies that there is more than one name that is abbreviated this way.  I personally don't know of any.  I think it should be removed and explained in her article, instead of this article, especially since it is very far from being a common way to use the colon.
:::::[[User:Panda|–panda]] 15:43, 3 November 2007 (UTC)
::::::The colon is used for contraction. What else would "s:t" and "Ax:son" be? I can't think of any examples of names other than Ax:son Johnson right now, and they're not overly common, but I know I've seen it before. And the comparison in this case should be with English since we're writing the article for English Wikipedia.

::::::I think you should try tweaking the text to fix what you feel is confusing. It's easier to discuss and reach a compromise that way. One recommendation I can give you, though, is that you try to condense the parenthetical info and avoid mathematical signs. Also, keep in mind that catering to those wanting to learn Swedish is not any of our concern. We have [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Swedish wikibooks] for that.

:::::::According to the [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] article, "In traditional grammar, a contraction is the formation of a new word from two or more individual words" so ''S:t'' and ''Ax:sson'' are not considered contractions in the traditional/common sense of the word.

But if you prefer, I'll modify it based on your comments and add it to the article.  [[User:Panda|–panda]] 17:41, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

::::* The Nationalencyklopedin entry also needs to be fixed (it needs more specific info about which version of NE the info is from) but since I don't have a solution for that right now, I haven't done anything about it yet.  I can always use the info from my version of NE since the numbers are the same.
::::* This isn't a matter about whether or not "Citations are there to help anyone who is actually going to look the source up, not to satisfy gratuitous demands for page numbers" or that it's annoying that certain info in included.  There are standardized methods for citing sources that should be followed in the English Wikipedia, such as [[The MLA Style Manual]], [[APA Style]], [[The Chicago Manual of Style]], or [[Harvard referencing]].  For example, the date a web article was retrieved is standard practice to include when citing web references.  See also [[WP:CITE]].
::::* Looking at the Virtual Finland reference, it actually doesn't support the statement that it cites and should probably be removed unless another reference can be found.
::::* Barfotabarn should also be listed in Sources.  I'll add it if someone else doesn't do it first.  The poem actually needs page numbers since it is a direct quote from a book.  If it in fact came from a website, then the website should be cited instead.  (See [[WP:CITE]].)
::::* In general, the article could use more references.

:::::*Bolander's book is cited as a whole because it's general, relatively common and conveniently brief. If the article has one section on grammar and one Swedish grammar has been cited, there's really not much to complain about in terms of clarity. We're talking about ''Svenska Akademiens grammatik'' here.
:::::*The US Census is very clearly cited in prose. Failing to see the connection with the mention of it in the sources because there's no footnote doesn't make much sense.
:::::*The NE articles are from the online version, which is now specified.
:::::*The date in webcites isn't the issue, but rather the annoying business of wikilinking it. The webcite templates force that linkage and is one of many reasons why I find them pointless.
:::::*If you want "more references", you should try to explain where and why. Preferably without claiming personal ignorance or that the ''amount'' of footnotes isn't enough.
:::::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 09:31, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

::::::* If you look at the article, there are several paragraphs that are completely without references.  If you'd like an example, look at the Classification section.  Who states that "Swedish is an Indo-European language" and that "it belongs to the East Scandinavian languages"?  And who claims that "Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered to be dialects of a common Scandinavian language"?  Where did any of this info come from?  Right now, the majority of the article doesn't pass [[WP:V]].
::::::* You may know that the Bolander book is from Svenska Akademien, but it's not obvious from the reference.  So either page numbers should be listed, the book should be moved down to Recommended reading, or the in-line citation moved up.  On the topic of grammar, who states that Swedish nouns are either "common" or "neuter"?  My grammar book uses different English terms.
::::::* In general, I've noticed that in-line citations have been added to the very end of a section.  If those citations are for the entire section, they should be placed at the ''beginning'' of the section.
::::::* Dates do not need to be spelled out.  It is sufficient to put them in [[ISO 8601]] YYYY-MM-DD format.  At any rate, a consistent format should definitely be used.  I've fixed this.
::::::* It is insufficient to only state "online version" of NE.  You also need to include the actual link to each article and the date each article was accessed, like for any other web citation.
::::::* Simply including something in the prose isn't sufficient.  It should still contain an in-line reference of some sort.  I've added that and fixed the reference since the text wasn't correct.  (The date is from the 2000 US Census, not 2004.)
::::::* Are you going to find the page number for Barfotabarn?  If not, I plan to change it to a web reference.

::::::It turns out that full dates should be linked, according to the [[MOS:DATE#Autoformatting and linking|MOS]] and [[WP:OVERLINK#Dates|WP:OVERLINK]], for preference formatting purposes.  So I'm changing the references that you modified back to reflect this. –[[User:Panda|panda]] ([[User talk:Panda|talk]]) 17:27, 27 November 2007 (UTC)
:::::::MOS is a recommendation, and not every single aspect of it is a requirement. The date someone looked up a web reference has has ''absolutely nothing'' to do with the article topic and is there for nothing but a distraction. Insisting that they be linked serves no encyclopedic purpose.
:::::::*Citations are more logically placed after the statements it's supposed to cover, as is done throughout this article. If anything, placing it after the first sentence will only result in another other zealous rule-enforces to demand that it be placed after the next sentence. And the next, and the next, and then we'll have the same footnote after every single sentence as is popular in many other articles. Placing citations at the end of paragraphs is often done in academic sources.
:::::::*"Common" and "neuter" are translated terms thta to my knowledge are accepted. I don't have a Swedish grammar in English, so I can't say either way. If you have better candidates, go ahead an change them. Either way, they are merely synonyms for the same concept. It doesn't change the status of grammatical genders in Swedish. And ''Svenska Akademiens grammatik'' is not just any old grammar. At over 2,800 pages, it's ''the'' grammar of the Swedish language. That the Academy has sponsored more basic grammars is another matter altogether.
:::::::*The online version of NE is sufficient. Demanding links to a commercial electronic encyclopedia when it's easily searchable (and not available unless you pay for it) is just as pointless as the suggestion that I'd have to provide give page numbers for a dictionary.
:::::::*No, including something in prose is sufficient, because you have to deliberately ignore the connection to miss it. You obvious failed to do an even cursery glance at the text in that case and removed the reference merely because there wasn't a footnote next to it. To me that smacks of [[WP:POINT|point-making]].
:::::::As for the article failing [[WP:V]], I do encourage you to bring up some deficiencies that should be amended, but I would like to ask you to not simply start bring up the movement and additions of random footnotes to where ''you'' prefer them as a lack of verifiability.

::::::''constituting one of two genders of a language, esp. a gender comprising nouns that were formerly masculine or feminine: Swedish nouns are either common or neuter.''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/common]
:::::And here's "neuter gender" (1 a):
::::::''noting or pertaining to a gender that refers to things classed as neither masculine nor feminine.''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neuter]
:::::"En" and "ett words" are self-explanatory terms that are primarily used in secondary educational facilities and among foreign students. They're convenient for the purpose of learning a language, but have very little to do with linguistics and describe only the surface form of the indefinite articles of those two genders. It's like naming a verb conjugation after the associated suffixes rather than proper linguistic terms. ''Spelat'', for example, is the [[supine]] form, not a "-t verb". [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 09:25, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::There's two, actually. Bartleby and dictionary.com, but that was just to bring the proper terminology to your attention.

The population in 2005 and 2004 isn't relevant to the current population any more than the population in 1950.

:Guidelines are guidelines, not policy. I have an extremely good argument against this slavish following of the letter of the law which is very, very simple: '''it has absolutely no relevance to the article, the article's general topic or even the references themselves and they do not allow for deeper understanding of the Swedish langauge'''. That I, or anyone else, chose to check out the website of [[Statistics Finland]] on 27 November 2007 has nothing to do with the fact that Pope Urban II declared the First Crusade at the [[Council of Clermont]] or that [[Carlos Andres Perez]] was the target of a military coup on the same date. It does not advance any readers understanding of Swedish. Period.

:And if we're going to start [[ruleslawyer]]ing, then why not heed this rather fitting passage from the description of what a guideline is:
::''It is a generally accepted standard that all editors should follow. However, it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception.''
:Articles are not written for the tiny minority of readers that happen to be registered users and especially not for the absolutely insignificant number of those registered users that actually bother changing the preferences for whether (again, completely irrelevant) dates are linked.

Peter, it doesn't really make the article appreciably worse to have them linked. Lurker, your decision to slap Peter with [[WP:DTTR|a template]] and keep reverting was in poor taste. While no one owns the article, respecting the opinions of the main author of an article is basic courtesy, especially over such a minor detail with no real impact on either accuracy or reader experience. Even though the guidelines say so, it is really just an excuse for a deficiency in the MediaWiki software and (as has been noted) can be confusing for readers. <strong>[[user:henrik|<font color="#B38F00">henrik</font>]]<small>•[[user talk:henrik|<font color="#AFA29F">talk</font>]]</small></strong> 17:52, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

For the billionth time (not by me, of course): Dates are wikilinked so that the MediaWiki software will render them according to user preferences. I have my own preferences set so that dates are displayed day-month; e.g., the above reference to the "November 27" article appears to me as "27 November." As the guidelines say, all full dates should be wikilinked so that these preferences can be given effect.

Hey, all!

Would everybody calm down a bit? I've been encouraged by Panda to join the discussion. Before I start, I would just like to rebut one of the statements regarding the guidelines above; that they say that "all full dates should be wikilinked". They don't. They say "Full dates, and days and months, are '''normally''' (my bolding) ''autoformatted'', by inserting double square-brackets, as for linking.".

The word "all" is not present - at least where I looked (and I used the link that was provided).

This guideline is partly contradicted by another guideline: "Link to one of this pages only if it is likely to deepen the reader's understanding of a topic". This indicates to me that if links are not relevant, then (maybe) "normally" doesn't apply.

My impression is that the software authors have confused two good functions: Linking and Date-formatting. The key phrase above is "as for linking". '''Linking''' connects two articles that are meaningful to connect. '''Date-formatting''' allows users to have dates displayed according to their preferences (if any).

What if we could separate these functions? There must be a way to do that. Look at the <nowiki>ISBN</nowiki> function. It's automatically creating a link to a special page, without one having to use double square-brackets. In the case of dates, the problem is probably that it's hard for the software to correctly identify a date, as it can be entered in many ways, and, in some cases, something that isn't a date could mistakenly be identified as an ISO date. So why don't we help the software along a bit? Let's be creative. Could there be "wiki-tags" - those that start with a < and end with a >, I don't remember their names - defined for this purpose? It could look like this: <nowiki><usdate>January 15, 2001</usdate></nowiki>, or like this: <nowiki><isodate>2001-01-15</isodate></nowiki>. Both would display the date according to the user's set preference, if any, otherwise as entered. Does anybody know if this is in an way feasible? (Or if tags don't work then maybe templates?) This way dates could be formatted according to everybody's pleasure, without having them linked to the date article - unless double square-brackets are also present.

As you might have guessed, I'm inclined to agree with Peter Isotalo and Henrik, links (in their original meaning) should be relevant to the article to be meaningful. As for the arguments ''for'' linking ''all'' dates, A) it helps users who choose to set date preference, B) it is an agreed-upon policy, and C) it does no harm, I would say that A) is a valid argument, but the function could possibly be achieved in the way described above, B) policies and guidelines are subjects of change, if a new consensus can be reached, and C) it actually does harm: it clutters articles with links, so that relevant ones will be harder to discriminate from the less relevant ones, and it creates links from date articles to zillions of articles, which makes it harder to find those in which the date has a relevant meaning.

So, step 1: Is this a good idea? Step 2: Does anybody know of a software guru who can assert if this is feasible? Step 3: Could we agree on a new consensus?     [[User:LarRan|LarRan]] 21:51, 3 December 2007 (UTC)
: A drawback of internet communications is that small conflicts easily escalate into much larger ones. A lot of the small cues we use to understand the intent and meaning behind other peoples comment are in the form of body language, which written communications lack. I'm pretty sure that if we all sat in the same room, it wouldn't take more than a few minutes to decide whether dates should be linked and no one would be particularly upset. Sometimes the best you can do is to try to take a step back and laugh at the silliness :)

: However, modifying the MediaWiki software to fix the bug that dates must be linked in order for auto-formatting to work is probably not practical to resolve the dispute - I don't expect that is something that could be fixed for months, even on a fairly optimistic time schedule. <strong>[[user:henrik|<font color="#B38F00">henrik</font>]]<small>•[[user talk:henrik|<font color="#AFA29F">talk</font>]]</small></strong> 23:43, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

:LarRan, I find your argument a bit silly, especially your point C. It only takes one click on a link to learn what's typically at an article titled, e.g., [[November 27]], and once you've done it it's easy to ignore date links, even while paying attention to others. I do it all the time. So I don't see date links as "harmful." As to point B, it's true that "policies and guidelines are subjects of change [sic]," but in this case I'm not aware of any movement in that direction, and even if there were, it would not be relevant to any argument until a consensus was reached to actually change the policy or guideline in question. As to point A, your argument here is kind of silly too: it's easy to speculate about what the MediaWiki software ''could'' or ''should'' do, if only it worked the way we want it to, but right now it works the way it works and we have to live with those limitations. I agree with your analysis and I don't particularly think wikilinking is a good way to handle date formatting (although handling it in another way would require some kind of special markup for dates, which adds to the body of what editors need to be familiar with -- also not ideal), but for immediate purposes there's nothing we can do about that. So for now, full dates should be linked. --[[User:Tkynerd|Tkynerd]] 00:22, 4 December 2007 (UTC)
:: I find links which lead to nowhere relevant mildly annoying, and I know of several users who have said they found the date links confusing. A change in consensus often start like this. A group of editors decide that a certain guideline doesn't really help them improve the article, so they decide to do without it. Later, they bring it up on the policy pages: "hey, we've managed to write a perfectly fine article while not doing this or that, and we think it's not really a helpful guideline" and the policy is discussed and changed. And with all due respect, the number of users who actually set the date preference to something non-standard is  minuscule compared to the total number of readers (who see no benefit from the linking), and probably also small compared to the number of readers that get confused by the unnecessary links. <strong>[[user:henrik|<font color="#B38F00">henrik</font>]]<small>•[[user talk:henrik|<font color="#AFA29F">talk</font>]]</small></strong> 00:35, 4 December 2007 (UTC)
:::I'd like to second this. One of the basic complaints about Wikipedia I get from pepole I know in real life is (who aren't Wikipedians) is that of over-linking. [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 00:42, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

:::You appear to misunderstand the purpose of user date prefs. The "number of users who actually set the date preference to something non-standard" is not the point; the point is that '''there are multiple standards''', and user date prefs permit users to see dates in the (usually standard) format they prefer. I have my prefs set so that dates display, e.g., ''3 December 2007'', because that's my preference; it also happens to be standard in many English-speaking countries, even though it is not standard in the country that I live in and that also tends to dominate the English Wikipedia. Another point is that user date prefs permit the consistent display of dates (to whatever format the user's date prefs are set; if the user doesn't make any changes, it will probably be the ''December 3, 2007'' format, IINM) '''regardless of how they are entered in wikitext by the editor'''. <nowiki>[[December 3]], [[2007]]</nowiki> will display for me as ''3 December 2007'' even though that's not how it was entered. Delinking dates puts the burden on the editors of a given article to use a consistent date format (and to agree on one, in the face of competing standard formats! How well is that likely to work?). --[[User:Tkynerd|Tkynerd]] 04:05, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

:Well, Tkynerd, you may find my C argument silly, but I, on the other hand, find the urgent need of date-formatting a bit exaggerated. I, for one, have no problem understanding November 27, though I mostly write that date as 27 November. I guess that goes for all of us. As for ISO dates, they are edited with dashes, while "US dates" (when entered as numbers only) are edited with slashes. There shouldn't be a problem there either. And, also, you addressed only half of my C argument: what about the zillion of articles that link to the date articles? How do you identify those in which the date really has a relevant meaning - e.g. 9/11?

:And I don't agree with what you say: "for now full dates should be linked". As I mentioned, the guidelines do not say that. They say that they should ''normally'' be linked. (No-one has contradicted me on that so far.) Thus there must be situations where they shouldn't be linked, right? Which situations would that be, in your opinion? [[User:LarRan|LarRan]] 04:11, 4 December 2007 (UTC)
::I did miss the part of your argument that said that linking all dates makes it hard (or really, impossible) to distinguish relevant links to dates. However, that really amounts to repeating the argument that the MediaWiki software should not use wikilinking for date formatting, and while we're in agreement on that point, there's nothing we can do about it. In addition, I have a hard time thinking of any situation where a date link would actually be relevant. To answer your last question, I cannot think of any situation where it would be undesirable to link full dates. It's entirely possible that "normally" in the guideline is simply a weasel word, although I don't know that; I think it's a mistake to attach too much significance to it. Also, you say: ''I, for one, have no problem understanding November 27, though I mostly write that date as 27 November. I guess that goes for all of us.'' I, for one, have no problem ignoring date links while paying attention to others. I guess that goes for all of us.

:Let's break this up into two separate issues:
:*panda has simply misunderstood how population figures are normally stated. Any article dealing with the current size of a certain population always gives the latest updated stats, usually with the term "as of X". The problem is that panda has interpreted this to mean that one should state the initial year when the approximate current population reached that figure. In this case, the population has gone from 5.53% in 2004 to 5.49% 2006, and considering that the article doesn't even state the population at more than one decimal, either way the figure would be 5.5%. Furthermore, panda has assumed that population statistics for languages in Finland are based only on language profeciency, not [[first language]]. This is easily refuted by checking out alternative (but less specific) sources like [http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=26218 this] and by the simple logical conclusion that his assumption would also mean that whoever is proficient in one language is automatically excluded from being proficient in another, i.e. that every single resident of Finland speaks only one language and nothing else.
:*How much of the article that needs referencing has yet to be revealed by panda. He's asked for a specific page reference of ''Barfortabarn'', and I've replied that I don't have the book at hand and thought it enough with just a reference to the title (since Ferlin is so well-known).

::::If you just posted some references instead of complaining about how the article doesn't need more references, this wouldn't be a conflict.  The [http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=26218 Virtual Finland] reference claims that in 2003 5.5% of the population are Swedish speakers while in 2004 5.6% were Swedish speakers.  At the same time, Statistics Finland contradicts that (2003 = 5.55% ~ 5.6%, 2004 = 5.53% ~ 5.5%).  And the [http://www.folktinget.fi/pdf/publikationer/finlanssv2005.pdf pdf] only gives number for 1900 and 2006, which are identical to the Statistics Finland stats.  So now what?  At least they establish the %s are for Swedish speakers in Finland, which can equate to those whose first language is Swedish.  But the actual number is questionable and depends on which reference is considered the most reliable.  I would personally go with the numbers from Statistics Finland, since they were updated the most recently, use the PDF to establish that the numbers are for Swedish speaking Finns, and possibly comment on the contradictory numbers from Virtual Finland in a footnote.  –[[User:Panda|panda]] ([[User talk:Panda|talk]]) 23:35, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

(unindent) Perhaps I am dense, but I see no conflict in these numbers. All references agree that currently about 5.5% of Finns are Swedish speakers and the minor variations that exist could be explained by rounding alone. Using the latest available figure ("As of 2006") and noting that the percentage has declined over the years (The virtual-finland ref has a history) should be sufficient. <strong>[[user:henrik|<font color="#B38F00">henrik</font>]]<small>•[[user talk:henrik|<font color="#AFA29F">talk</font>]]</small></strong> 07:23, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
: Stating "As of 2006" for something that has been true as of 2004 is simply incorrect and a misrepresentation of the data.  It's like stating "As of 2006, Norway is independent of Sweden."  Or for that matter, replace 2006 with 1906, 1907, 1908 or any year after 1905 when it actually became independent of Sweden.  –[[User:Panda|panda]] 15:23, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
:: Statistics that vary over the years are almost always reported that way. It is a way to alert the reader that the figure is dynamic. You are correct about the Norway example, but that is a discrete event which happened once. Had the status of Norway changed from month to month, "As of" would have been appropriate there too. <strong>[[user:henrik|<font color="#B38F00">henrik</font>]]<small>•[[user talk:henrik|<font color="#AFA29F">talk</font>]]</small></strong> 15:39, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Stats that vary over the years should be reported accurately and precisely.  [[WP:ASOF|As of]] is a method for dealing with statements that date quickly.  We really don't know what the stats will be for 2007 or later, and with the current trend, it is likely to decrease.  In this case, the statistic 5.5% was true in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  So stating "as of 2006", although accurate, would not be precise.  Don't mix [[accuracy and precision|accuracy with precision]].  It is a part of the [[WP:MOS]] to be as precise as possible, according to [[WP:DATE#Precise language]] and [[WP:DATED]].

:::The 5.5% stats have now been updated.  I removed [[first language]] as that has an ambiguous meaning.

== Reply to tags ==
Other than those tags that have been dealt with by clarification or extra referencing, there are some the merit of which I'd like to address. Here are the replies sorted by section:
*"Classification": The entire section is supported by Crystal. The statement "more recent" is relative, general information that doesn't make any claims about exactly when this new approach was taken.
*"History": I see no motivation for any of the tags in this section and no indication of any attempt to check even any reference whatsoever. The implication that the last sentence is weasel wording I don't understand at all. It's merely a disclaimer that warns the reader not to take subdivisions too literally, as this languages simply never change over the course of just a year.
*"Official status": Questioning that Swedish is recommended at a gov't level doesn't strike me as having any point other than adding footnotes.
*"Vocabulary": Questioning that ''-a'', the one basic verb ending in Swedish (the exceptions mostly being extremely old and basic verbs like ''gå'', ''stå'' or ''dö''), as original research makes absolutely no sense. There is basically no other way to create a new verb in Swedish other than to add an ''-a'' (except by making a compound with one of the exceptional verbs).
*"Immigrant variants": The section as a whole is based on Kotsinas and the footnote covers the information. The status of Rinkeby Swedish as a general term for all types of immigrant Swedish is hardly something that one ought to demand a separate citation for. Other terms exist, but it's not really relevant to ''this'' article.

As for the request to clarify the origins of a boy with two Swedish parents, I can't help but wondering what exactly needs clarifying. [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 02:01, 3 December 2007 (UTC)
:* Re: Removing citations requests simply because you don't see the purpose of them: From [[WP:V]]: "'''The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material.  All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged should be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation. The source should be cited clearly and precisely to enable readers to find the text that supports the article content in question.'''"  It's not my job to find references for text I never added.  Citation requests should not be removed until a citation is found by someone.  The editor who added the text most likely knows the source and should add the missing citations to conform to [[WP:V]].
:* Classification:  There are 2 paragraphs, and each paragraph has plenty of statements that need citations for [[WP:V|verifiability]].  It's currently not clear that all of the text came from the same reference and it needs to be shown somehow in the text, not here in the talk page.  If the entire text came from a single source, that can be made clear by a sentence in the very beginning claiming this.  The same applies to the rest of the sections in the article that are based on a single source.     :* History: Dates should be substantiated with references since they're not common knowledge, they make the text verifiable, and they help give references for interested readers who would like to find out more about the topic.
:* Re: weasel words.  See [[WP:WEASEL]].  The text "the system of subdivisions used in this article is the most commonly used by Swedish linguists" needs attribution.  How can the text claim it is the most commonly used with no reference to support this?
:* Official status: I dispute that it is "officially recommended".  It might be unofficially recommended or unofficially understood that everything be in Swedish but I've never heard that it is "officially recommended".  Until there is a reference backing that claim, it is a disputed statement.
:* Vocabulary
::* I see you just reverted the entire text and managed to remove the wiki-link I added.  Maybe you should try editing the text instead of reverting in the future?  Your reverts only create a [[WP:CIVIL|a hostile and inappropriate editing climate]].
::* Who claims that new Swedish verbs are created by adding -a to an existing noun?  There are probably more examples of it ''not'' being true than of it being true, such as "stola" from "en stol", "skoa" from "en sko", "sänga" from "en säng", "hunda" from "en hund", etc.  Just because you've found a few examples that fit the case doesn't make it true.  That's pure [[WP:OR]] unless there is a reference for it.  Also "bila" doesn't mean to drive recreationally, it is much closer to "to drive around", "to drive", or "to travel by car" (the last defn being the one given by Lexin).
::* The long text example specifically states "very long" and "produktionsstyrningssystemsprogramvaruuppdatering" is not very long in comparison to "nagellacksborttagningsmedel".  Nor does it make any sense at all in English the way it is currently written.
:* Immigrant variants: I would agree that Rinkeby Swedish has to do with Rinkeby and Stockholm.  If you now claim that it is also associated with Malmö and Göteborg, then a reference is needed.  The text also needs to clarify why the survey is even mentioned in that section.  What does it have to do with immigrant variants and why is it relevant there?  What does it have to do with Rinkeby Swedish being "surprisingly similar to variants in geographically distant immigrant-dominated suburbs", since the previous paragraph claims that Rinkeby Swedish is also for immigrant variants in Malmö and Göteborg.  To me, the author is claiming Rinkeby Swedish to only in Stockholm and the so-called variants in geographically distant immigrant-dominated suburbs are the ones in Malmö and Göteborg.  (The text contradicts itself and should be corrected with references that support the correct version.)  What does the boy with two Swedish parents have to do with anything?  Is that supposed to be somehow related to how long they have lived in Sweden?  (It's possible to take as few as 3 years in Sweden to get Swedish citizenship, so being Swedish doesn't say anything about how long someone has lived in Sweden.)  Was he speaking Rinkeby Swedish also?  What was his native language?  That section is supposed to be about immigrant variants of Swedish but it appears to be more [[WP:TOPIC|off topic]].  AFAIK, the boy's native language could have been Swedish, in which case, it really has nothing to do with immigrant variants.
:* "high literacy rate": That's a weasel word.  How much is "high"?  There is in fact a reference for the 99% literacy rate which I can add when I find time.
: Removing citation requests and reverting text made in good faith without any reasonable rationale other than indicating "I prefer my text" only makes me believe that you're claiming [[WP:OWNERSHIP|ownership]] of the page and that you don't want to find the refs, especially since you chose to remove them without asking first why the text was tagged.  I would encourage you to put the tags back that you didn't find references for to show that you're [[WP:AGF|acting in good faith]] and not claiming ownership.   As the author of the text, you should be adding the references according to [[WP:V]].

: From my stand-point, we're not progressing.  I would suggest listing this article in [[WP:FAR|Featured Article Review]] to get comments from the WP community on the FA status of this article if you would like to continue argue whether or not the article needs references. –[[User:Panda|panda]] 04:07, 3 December 2007 (UTC)
::Improving articles is a collaborative process. I've honored many of your requests right off the bat and claiming that no progress is being made is not particularly fair of you. You should be prepared to accept at least a few rounds of discussion before threatening to go to FAR to be vindicated. I've stuck to discussing the article and the accuracy issues and I think it would be prudent if you didn't try to resort to characterizing my actions as hostile.
::*"History": Every single date, especially not that are given as entire centuries, doesn't require separate citations. The division of Swedish into these historical periods can be referenced in even the most basic sources on Swedish. Check Pettersson, if anything. If you wish to argue on principle that there's no scholarly consensus, then you should at least try to give an example.
::*"Vocabulary"
:::*The article makes only one claim, which is that ''-a'' is "very productive" as a way to create new verbs. It's a claim that is about as trivial as claiming that ”plural endings in English are often made with the ending ''-s''". All the examples you've provided of this not being true are actually examples of the formula ''noun + -a''. I don't understand your reasoning here.
:::*The new long word example you introduced could never, ever be used in a normal sentence. It's more akin to ''flaggstångsknoppsreparatör'' ("flagpole knob repairman" for those who don't speak Swedish), a common example that is more or less fictional. The point here is not flabbergast non-Swedish speakers by giving completely outlandish examples, but trying to illustrate at least moderately feasible long-ish compounds that differ from how English handles words like this. As far as I remember, I didn't come up with the two example I reverted to, but I do consider them to be very good. As for your complain that the English translation makes no sense, could you expand on that a bit?
::*"Immigrant variants": "Rinkeby Swedish" is to the best of my knowledge the only reasonably common English term for variants of Swedish spoken by immigrants and their children. If not, maybe there can be a rewording to point out that Malmö and Gothenburg also have their particular forms of immigrant dialects. The relevant passage (including the small change that I made) says that Rinkeby Swedish may be spoken by the children of both immigrants and non-immigrants. I should also stress that ''all'' the boys in this case had Swedish as their native language, though those with immigrant parents were most likely multilingual. That the parents were Swedish in this context means that they were not immigrants. If you want clarification in this issue, I really recommend reading Kotsinas yourself. Rinkeby Swedish is a very complicated topic.
::*I've removed the comment on literacy altogether since it's not necessary for the text and since it only appears to breed contention.

:::Stating "You should be prepared to accept at least a few rounds of discussion before threatening to go to FAR to be vindicated" seems to at least indicate that you agree the article needs more references.  So please start adding them.
:::* Classification: Still needs something to make it clear that the entire text (2 paragraphs) is based on a single reference.  The same applies to the entire History section, Standard Swedish, and Sounds.
:::* History: If what you say is true, then add the references to prove it.
:::* Finland Swedish: Completely lacking any citations and could use at least one.  Why did you remove the cited text with stats about the percent of Swedish speakers in Finland today/2006?  How do you know Swedish was the dominant language is Finland until 1917?  The [http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html#structure Statistics Finland numbers] contradict this (in 1900, only 12.89% of the population were Swedish speakers).
:::* Vocabulary:
::::* What was your reason for reverting the text?  If you only wanted to replace ''produktionsstyrningssystemsprogramvaruuppdatering'', then you could have done that without a revert.
::::* No matter what your personal opinion is about making new verbs, the entire sentence is still [[WP:OR]] until there is a reference that supports it.  I've already stated why I contest that statement.
::::* ''produktionsstyrningssystemsprogramvaruuppdatering'' translated as "production controller system software update" is not the best way to translate the text since it has to do with process control or product management, not "production controller", which doesn't make sense in this context.  So it is better to replace it with something that makes more sense.  If you're only interested in long word examples that can actually be used, then why not use something that ''may'' be used, such as ''uppehållstillståndsansökningsfrågor'' (resident permit application questions), or a real example that ''is'' used, such as ''rusdrycksförsäljningsförordning'' ("intoxicating drink sales ordinance", which means the ordinance for the sale of alcoholic beverages).
:::* Immigrant variants:
::::* The text needs a reference to substantiate that Rinkeby Swedish is in fact used for immigrant variants of Swedish outside of Stockholm, especially since your own reference in the 2nd paragraph (Kotsinas) seems to contradict this.  There is nothing wrong with simply calling it "immigrant variants" or "immigrant dialect" instead of Rinkeby Swedish until a ref can be found.
::::* dialects vs sociolects: needs refs to support this.
::::* It's not my job to read Kotsinas since I didn't add the text.  Since you've read it and apparently added the text, its your job to clarify the text until it makes sense to someone who reads it for the first time.  It doesn't matter what you write about it in the talk page.  Try editing the text or proposing text changes instead.  How do you know that stating both parents are Swedish means they are ''not'' immigrants?  You're Swedish and you're an immigrant.  Being one does not necessarily exclude the other.  Assuming so if the text does not state it is [[WP:OR]].  If the text does state it, then make it clear.
:::* Barfotabarn still needs page numbers since it is a quote from a book.  The text should also be quoted.  The year in the Sources section and the text also don't match.  If you copied it from a web site, why not just add the website as the reference instead?

== Mutually intelligible? ==
The article claims that Swedish, Norwegian and Danish are mutually intelligible, but also that there are dialects of Swedish that are not intelligible to most Swedish speakers. I believe that the dialects are overemphasized in this article. To me, the regional variation in Sweden seems less than in England or in the Netherlands, and I find the uniformity over such large distances quite striking. As to Danish, most Swedes have tremendous problems making sense of the spoken language. /[[User:Pieter Kuiper|Pieter Kuiper]] ([[User talk:Pieter Kuiper|talk]]) 07:57, 7 December 2007 (UTC)
:I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swedish_language&diff=176352050&oldid=176347334 tweaked] the statement on mutual intellibility somewhat. I agree that spoken Danish can be quite difficult for Swedes to understand, but it's certainly not as different as languages like German or English.

== Date autoformatting is sick and not being fixed ==
Some months ago, I decided to encourage WPians ''not'' to use the autoformatting function, because it is dysfunctional in several key ways. The arguments appear in the archives of this talk page and elsewhere. A move signed by 85 WPians to ask Bugzilla to FIX the biggest problem—the entanglement with the linking functionality—has thus far failed; this is more reason to discourage its use and put up with the several major formattings for dates, just as we do the varieties of spelling.

I support moves here not to autoformat dates. [[User:Tony1|<font color="darkgreen">'''Tony'''</font >]] [[User_talk:Tony1|<font color="darkgreen">(talk)</font >]] 00:30, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

===Sample===
I'm wondering what the purpose of the "Sample" section is.  Including a Swedish poem doesn't really feel relevant since nothing in the article has to do with Swedish poetry.  It may be more appropriate to place it in the [[Nils Ferlin]] article instead.  I was considering replacing it with something more relevant.  One example would be to take the first few sentences from the original version of Pippi Långstrump, a version in modern Swedish, and an English translation to show how the Swedish language has changed in the last 60 years.  Or use some other text from [[Project Gutenberg]] where you can compare it with modern Swedish.  Comments? –[[User:Panda|panda]] 23:45, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

Here's an example text from 1867 that could be very suitable for this:
: Det är väl knappast någon botanist, som icke vid sitt första möte med Daggörterna förvånats öfver dessa fina växters ovanliga utseende och märkliga egenheter.

Dessa blad äro temligen tjocka och håren, som bekläda dem, utsöndra en klibbig vätska, hvilken såsom silfvertrådar sprider sig på mossan.

How would an excerpt from a more well-known Swedish author not be an improvement for the article?

:To me, replacing a short, very pretty poem with a random snippet from a children's book would be setting a tone not appropriate in an encyclopedic article. I don't believe that Lindgren's fame in this case is a relevant argument.

:As for spelling changes, there are probably hundreds of examples. Danish made ''[[å]]'' official in 1948, German has gone through several more recent spelling changes (most of them hotly disputed), the [[Russian alphabet]] lost four letters after the Russian Revolution, Japanese and Chinese have gone through huge changes during the 20th century and Korean dropped [[hanja]] almost entirely and went over to [[hangul]]. If we dare to stretch the timeframe just a wee bit more, languages like Turkish and Vietnamese have even switched to entirely new forms of writing systems.

::Regarding the languages you've mentioned:
::* The [[Danish language]] article mentions the ''å'' issue, and does not include a sample text but does show an example of ''å'' vs ''aa'' in use.
::* The [[German spelling reform of 1996]] is mentioned in the [[German language]] article with many comparisons given in the [[German spelling reform of 1996]] article.
::* The changes to the [[Russian alphabet]] are shown with sample texts both with and without the removed letters.
::* The different ways of writing Japanese are shown in [[Japanese writing system]] with sample texts written in all the methods.
::* The changes to the Chinese language are shown and compared in [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] with sample text written in both methods.
::* Comparisons of the Korean writing systems are shown in [[Korean language]], with more found in [[Hangul]].
::* [[Turkish language]] compares the old and new systems.
::* [[Vietnamese language]] gives an example text from one of the old systems, translated to modern Vietnamese and English.

::Looking at other Wikipedia articles only confirms that comparisons are relevant and should be shown.

::In comparison, spelling changes to the Swedish language are only mentioned briefly in the Modern Swedish section.  However, you can see the old spelling used in classic Swedish literature and in some specific instances today, such as ''af''.

::I personally don't have anything against using text from another Swedish author or poet that does show the spelling changes.

:::Well, I guess we still disagree, panda. The Danish example is given a proportionally tiny amount of space in the relevant article, and the German spelling changes are more recent and more prominent for a reason. ''All'' the other examples are vastly more influential on the language than anything that has happened in Sweden the last few centuries. And what should be noted, is that many of the articles you cite are not main articles on languages, but sub-articles on alphabets and writing systems.

Also, there is no article called [[Swedish writing system]], nor should there be since it's not as extensive a change as other languages that have one.  Nor is this about letters disappearing from the Swedish alphabet, so it shouldn't go in [[Swedish alphabet]].

::::The points you've ignored are that it can be found in classic Swedish literature, it is an important part of the history of the Swedish language and mentioned in NE, and there's no reason to not show an example of it here, especially since comparisons are apparently normally shown in language articles in Wikipedia.  Your reason for keeping the current text has simply boiled down to "I prefer poetry in a FA article", which is also fine with me.

== Strindberg ==

Perhaps the article writer's Stockholmian background is the reason why Strindberg is called the most influential Swedish writer of modern Swedish literature? People from other parts of the country might argue it was [[Gustav Fröding]], [[Selma Lagerlöf]], [[Erik Axel Karlfeldt]] or [[Pär Lagerkvist]] (all of them Nobel laureates). / [[User:Fred J|Fred]]-[[User_talk:Fred J|J]] 13:03, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

:Since the issue is really not that any one doubts Strindberg was influential (but rather if he was the ''most'' influential) couldn't we just solve the issue by including some of these names as well? I don't think this is really an issue of center vs periphery, though.
:[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] <sup>[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]</sup> 11:26, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::As fond as I am of the works of Lagerlöf and Lagerkvist neither of them can be considered to be as influential as Strindberg; he is to Sweden as [[Ibsen]] is to [[Norway]], as [[Shakespeare]] is to [[England]]. His not having received the [[Nobel Prize]] is well known to be the result of his controversial; that is to say, progressive; stands and the conservatism of the [[Swedish Academy]] and particularly its secretary at the time. 

::This is ''not'' to disparage the accomplishments of Fröding or Karlfeldt, and a section on the most influential writers of Sweden would be a welcome addition (do not however look to me to do it; I write mainly on ballet.) But to hold that any of them is as influential as Strindberg was -- and is -- would be to place the Bard of Avon in the same rank as [[Kyd]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] (both of whom I likewise appreciate.)

I agree with Robert Greer that Strindberg is the most influential Swedish writer from that era. However, I think it merits a source to say that Strindberg is considered to have initiated ''[[:sv:Nusvenska|Nusvenska]]''.

[[User:Fred J|Fred]]-[[User_talk:Fred J|J]] 16:11, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

:: ''Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the new national language that was emerging, and among them were also prolific authors like the poet Gustaf Fröding, Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf, and controversial writer and playwright August Strindberg.''

: but my version of [[Nationalencyklopedin]] doesn't make any claims about how Strindberg or any other author, for that matter, or how scholars or politicians influenced nusvenska.

:::: The current problem with the text is not about how influential Strindberg was as an author, but whether or not he influenced nusvenska (1900-present).  Contrary to what [[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter Isotalo]] claims, the text does not only state that "he was an influential writer", but instead that he as well as "Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the new national language" (nusvenska).  In other words, Strindberg and others actually influenced contemporary Swedish somehow.  Currently, there is nothing to substantiate this in the article nor in [[Nationalencyklopedin|NE]].
:::: If you have a reference that states how Strindberg influenced nusvenska, then please add it.  Quoting the relevant text here would also be helpful.  But being considered the first contemporary author or an influential author is not the same as stating someone influenced nusvenska.

The formation of Swedish as a standardized national language has been dictated by the development in a much more confined arena. Besides, we're refering to a collective in which Strindberg is widely recognized as one of the most important Swedish-language authors ever. The article in [[Nationalencyklopedin]] about him even claims outright that "Strindberg is the most prominent author in Swedish literature." This could certainly be nuanced, but we're still talking about an author who's influence is difficult to overestimate.

If it were true, why do you suppose they didn't include it?  No one doubts that Strindberg is a "prominent author in Swedish literature."  You're extrapolating an influence on Swedish literature to mean someone influenced the Swedish language.  Until there is a reference that backs up that claim, it is [[WP:SYN|synthesis]] of data and should not be included in the article.

(2) What I've said of Faulkner could certainly be said of any number of authors in smaller languages, such as Strindberg. (3) The essential point, which you seem determined to miss, is that being an influential author does not equal having an influence on a language.

:::::::::English and Swedish are in no way comparable languages in this issue.

:::1879 is not typically considered a part of nusvenska (1900s), but instead the end of yngre nysvenska/younger New Swedish (1732-1900).  The text also does ''not'' state '''''how''''' Strindberg influenced the Swedish language, only that the year Strindberg published ''Röda rummet'' (1879) is considered the border/limit for modern Swedish.  (Why?  I assume this is explained in the sentences following that statement.)  Also, there's still no reference that verifies how politicians or scholars influenced nusvenska, or how any of the authors mentioned in the article right now (Gustaf Fröding, Selma Lagerlöf, and Strindberg still) influenced nusvenska.

Speaking of which, I just checked [[Nationalencyklopedin]]'s article on ''svenska'' and much to my surprise I found the following passage in the section ''yngre nysvenska (1732–1900)'':
:::::::''Mot slutet av 1800-talet hade Sverige en kår av skönlitterära författare som levde av att skriva och som lästes av landets hela bildade allmänhet. Viktor Rydberg, August Strindberg, Selma Lagerlöf och andra fick genom sina böcker stor betydelse för skriftspråkets utveckling också utanför skönlitteraturen.''
:::::::"Towards the end of the 19th century Sweden had a body of fiction writers that lived on their writing and these were read by everyone in cultivated parts of society. and other hade a great significance to the development of the written language not just within fiction, but also in other aspects."

::::::::No language is primarily a written language, but an extremely important factor of the development into Modern Swedish was that pronunication became heavily influenced by spelling and that the written and spoken language approached one another. It was also the written standard language that formed the basis of Standard Swedish. It's covered in some detail in Josephson and is also described in NE.

::::::::: The ''nusvenska'' NE article states that the written and spoken language did approach each other and the written language had, in certain aspects, influenced the spoken language but it was "more natural that speech influenced writing", such as the 1906 spelling reform, the verb changes in 1950, text in fiction and the press, etc. To quote NE:
::::::::::''Det redan standardiserade skriftspråket har i vissa avseenden kommit att fungera som modell för rikstalspråket. När ord som glad uttalas med -d och gator med -or så sker detta under påverkan av skriften; i de flesta av landets dialekter heter det sedan länge gla resp. gater. Både ord och syntax i moderna svenskars tal är ofta övertagna från skriftspråket.''  '''''Men i takt med att dialekterna har försvagats och likheten mellan tal och skrift ökat blir det också naturligare att talet påverkar skriften. Skönlitteraturen har här ibland visat vägen i och med att romantexterna mer än tidigare består av replikskiften som i viss utsträckning speglar naturligt talspråk.  Pressen måste skriva enkelt för att nå en så stor publik som möjligt och har i vissa avseenden närmat sig talets stil och ordformer.'''''  ''Eftersom tidningsspråket i dag framstår som svenskt normalspråk påverkar det stil- och språkutvecklingen också inom andra genrer. (Dagspressen hade år 1993 en upplaga på över 4,3 miljoner ex.)''

:::::::::: ''År 1906 bestämdes att skolan skulle stava v och t efter talet (''vad'', ''leva'', ''liv'' inte ''hvad'', ''lefva'', ''lif''; ''rött'', ''målat'' inte ''rödt'', ''måladt''). (Senare försök att reformera stavningen på andra sätt i riktning mot talet har dock inte vunnit framgång, se rättskrivning 2.) Runt 1950 gick de allra flesta skribenter över till att använda verbets singularform också vid pluralt subjekt, dvs. man skrev ''de kommer'', ''vi var'', inte längre ''de komma'', ''vi voro''. (I de flesta av landets dialekter hade verbets numerusböjning försvunnit långt tidigare). Vissa av talets kortformer används numera allmänt i skrift (''ta'', ''dra'', ''sa'', ''ska'' m.fl.), och många småord som tidigare mest använts i talspråk har nu blivit gängse i skriftspråket: ''inte'' (gentemot ''ej'', ''icke''), ''bara'' (gentemot ''endast'', ''blott'') m.fl.''

::::::::: The comments here have been about Strindberg et al and their relationship to ''nusvenska'' afterall.  For the 3rd time, there's still no reference listed for how several scholars or politicians influenced ''nusvenska''.  According to NE, it was the spoken language that influenced politicians and their administrative texts, not the reverse.  Also from the ''nusvenska'' NE article:

:::::::::: ''Under efterkrigstiden har statens roll ökat i samhällslivet och den enskilde medborgaren möter allt fler administrativa texter. Det har blivit nödvändigt att lagar och förordningar utformas mera läsarvänligt, och ett stort arbete läggs därför ner på att ersätta det äldre snåriga kanslispråket med mer lättlästa uttryckssätt. Också det talspråkliga umgänget har blivit mer informellt under andra hälften av 1900-talet. Tidigare språkliga markeringar av rang och distans har inskränkts. Se du-tilltal, ni-tilltal.''

::::::::: Språkrådet (formerly [[Svenska språknämnden]]) gives an explanation for the Strindberg association with ''nusvenska'', which they state was due to "the renewal of the literary style".  So can you equate a renewal of the literary style to a change in the language?  And what exactly is meant by a renewal of the literary style?
:::::::::: ''Skälet att en gång sätta det exakta årtalet 1879 som bakre gräns för nusvenskan var att Strindbergs Röda rummet kom det året och förnyade den litterära stilen.'' ([http://www.sprakradet.se/2240 SPRÅKVÅRD 2007/1], p 42)

::::::::: Going back to my question: '''how''' did the authors influence the language?  They didn't seem to be involved in the any spelling reform, according to the ''rättskrivining'' article in NE.  This can also be seen if you compare Strindberg's play ''Till Damaskus'', published in [http://runeberg.org/damaskus/0009.html 1898], to a later edition published in [http://runeberg.org/strindbg/damaskus/0007.html 1915] (after the 1906 spelling reform).  So '''how did they influence the language'''?  According to the NE text above, the written language (via fiction writers and the press) started to be written more like spoken Swedish.  (''Skönlitteraturen har här ibland visat vägen i och med att romantexterna mer än tidigare består av replikskiften som i viss utsträckning speglar naturligt talspråk. Pressen måste skriva enkelt för att nå en så stor publik som möjligt och har i vissa avseenden närmat sig talets stil och ordformer.'')  So it would appear that '''the spoken language influenced the written language (via fiction writers and the press), which then influenced the standard language'''.

::::::::: Some of the confusion in the article may be related to the English translations for ''nysvenska'' and ''nusvenska'' used in Wikipedia.  ''Nusvenska'' should be called "Contemporary Swedish" or "Present-Day Swedish" (called "Modern Swedish" here) and ''nysvenska'' should be called "Modern Swedish" (called "New Swedish" here), according to Norstedts Swedish-English dictionary, the Nordic Language Secretariat, and Birger Winsa's extensive overview of the Swedish language ([http://books.google.com/books?id=2Bt2rkbCArcC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=modern+swedish+contemporary+swedish&source=web&ots=Npxns-3-lA&sig=S-CLfLOBKIfUCjzaLLb10o7CrEg&hl=en#PPA168,M1 html] or [http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/020/0376/jmmd0200376.pdf#page=62 PDF]).

:::If we remove "''and controversial writer and playwright August Strindberg''" from the above text, then the quote doesn't apply at all.  Neither does Hellberg's nor the NE article back-up that claim.  The NE article actually says it was the spoken language that influenced ''nusvenska'' and Hellberg's only states the same thing as your quote, nothing relevant.  No one is asking for you to copy "large chunks of texts", only the necessary text that actually backs-up that claim.  If it is so clearly stated in the reference you listed above, then it shouldn't require "large chunks of text".

And I'd really advise you to rethink the idea that any and all facts can be supported with brief quotes. All statements can't necessarily be summarized in easily-digested snippets of text.

Also, the issue here isn't ''only'' about Strindberg, but rather the ''entire'' sentence in the ''nusvenska'' section that states:

(back to the left) I have tried to browse through all the exchange of views above and quickly check up a few online Swedish-language sources on the subject. I note the following:
* The two actual years mentioned are usually 1879 (Strindberg's ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|Röda rummet]]'') and 1906 (the spelling reform), often together with a statement about a broader change in "1880s" or "just before 1900" or something like that. Describing it like a gradual process with 1879 & 1906 as two important years marking approximately the beginning and the end of the process seems reasonable to me.
* While Strindberg's novel is mentioned in many sources, statements on Strindberg usually say something like "The earliest literary work connected with Nusvenska is Röda rummet, which broke ground for a new literary style in Sweden", and actually not stronger statements like "Strindberg created Nusvenska" or "Strindberg was the most influential figure in Nusvenska". Perhaps it would be easier to go with the book and it's year as a description in the article, and just mention that Strindberg was the author?
* I think it is a bit unnecessary to term Strindberg controversial in connection with this article. He was definitely controversial in his time, but he's been staple fare so long with Swedish literature scholars and schoolchildren that the term feels misplaced to me. On the other hand "radical writer" or "politically radical writer" would be more timeless epithets that would seem fitting to him & NPOV.

:*I think I need to point out that although this began as a debate over the prominence of Strindberg, I believe that issue to be largely resolved since Strindberg is mentioned among other authors and public figures. It has now moved on to a slightly unfocused disagreement over whether change in literature means a change in language and whether written or spoken language should be focused on.
:*Language historians would probably not agree that any particular process of language change ended in 1906. One article that panda brought up puts the dividing line around 1945 and the source I have quoted, written by Josephson, puts a dividing line at around 1970.
:*I agree that "radical" is a better term for contemporary readers and I changed it according to your suggestion.

::Huh?  Which article did I bring up puts the dividing line around 1945?

:::The article I'm referring to is the one from ''[http://www.sprakradet.se/2240 Språkvård]'' that you cited a while ago. It's the one where the last sentence of the first paragraph reads "Staffan Hellberg [...] puts the limit for Contemporary Swedish at 1945" (my translation).'

:::: <s>The article states:
::::: ''Staffan Hellberg, en av författarna till Svenska Akademiens grammatik, sätter gränsen för nutidssvenskan vid 1945.''
:::: The article also differentiates between ''nutidssvenska'' and ''nusvenska''.  So they're talking about two different time periods of the Swedish language.  It gets very confusing if you translate ''nutidssvenska'' and ''nusvenska'' to English since both could be translated as contemporary Swedish but apparently refer to different time periods of the Swedish language. –[[User:Panda|panda]] ([[User talk:Panda|talk]]) 20:15, 26 March 2008 (UTC)</s>

:::: On second glance, I see that Hellberg writes:
::::: ''Här kommer jag att argumentera för att den nutida svenskan, nusvenskan, just nu ska räknas från 1945.''
:::: so he is arguing that ''nusvenska'' should start from 1945.  Interesting that he points out Astrid Lindgren as being one of the pioneers of modern Swedish:
::::: ''Astrid Lindgren, 100 år i år, var bland mycket annat också en av pionjärerna för modern svenska.  Det år Pippi Långstrump kom ut tog TT bort verbens pluralformer, Expressen slog igenom, och andra språkhistoriskt viktiga förändringar kan dateras till samma tid.  Staffan Hellberg, en av författarna till Svenska Akademiens grammatik, sätter gränsen för nutidssvenskan vid 1945.''
:::: Something I have noticed is that ''nusvenska'' is not acknowledged in all sources that discuss the history of the Swedish language.  Some books stop at ''nysvenska'' so that everything from 1732 onwards is a part of ''nysvenska'', e.g., (1) Vikør, Lars S. (1993) "The Nordic Languages", Oslo: Novus Press, p 48. (2) Norde, Muriel (1997) "The History of the Genitive in Swedish: A case study in degrammaticalization."  Amsterdam: vakgroep Skandinavische taal- en letterkunde, p 15.  The 2nd reference cites Wessén, Elias (1968) "Svensk språkhistoria I: Ljudlära och ordböjningslära" for the period divisions and notes that ''nusvenska'' is used in Wessén's book, but not in that book.  So it seems various scholars don't agree about the time frame for ''nusvenska''. –[[User:Panda|panda]] ([[User talk:Panda|talk]]) 23:56, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

== Enclitic s ==

I'm a native speaker of Swedish, and I was rather surprised to see "mannen i grå kavajs hatt" cited as a normal sentence. If forced to use it, I would write or say "mannens i grå kavaj hatt", this being the way it has been hammered into me by my teachers ("it is the man's hat, not his suit's!"). In practice, both variants cause consternation, are strongly discouraged in writing and cause raised eyebrows in speech. I'd like to change the text, but I'd like your opinions first. [[User:Lenborje|Lenborje]] ([[User talk:Lenborje|talk]]) 10:04, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

:I don't get the impression that the text actually states that the example is common, but that the usage of the enclitic s that you find to be erroneous to be the favored one for most people. The classic example of where to place the possessive ''-s'' is usually ''kungens av Danmark bröstkarameller'' ("the King of Denmark's [hard] candies"). As far as I know, the placing of the genitive suffix after the primary noun (''kungen'') is considered rather contrived, and no amount of old-fashioned hammering from school teachers is going to change that. It has grammatical logic going for it, but extremely few people would actually use that form. The problem here is not that people are abusing their own langauge, but the idea that grammar is always logical and consistent.

== Meant to be? ==

Quoting the article, paragraph 3:  "The standard word order is Subject Verb Object, though this can often be changed to stress certain words of phrases."

== Compound nouns? ==

The sentence "Compound nouns take their gender from the head, which in Swedish is always the last morpheme" makes little sense to me (as a non-syntactician, mind you). Elements of compound nouns need not be monomorphemic: at least in German, ''Antrittsvorlesung'' is compounded of ''Antritt'' and ''Vorlesung'', the latter being trimorphemic (''vor-les-ung''). The gender of the compound noun is indeed taken from the head (''Vorlesung''), but not from the last morpheme ''-ung'', which is not only (arguably) semantically empty, but also does not command gender as such.

==Dagö Swedish speaking?==

Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't [[Gutnish]] rather than Swedish spoken in [[Hiiumaa|Dagö]]? Of course, in the later part of the period 13th to 20th century this doesn't matter much due to swedification, but in the early part [[Old Gutnish]] wasn't a dialect of [[Old Swedish]], but its own dialect of [[Old Norse]]. You wouldn't e.g. claim Old Swedish was generally spoken in [[Iceland]] in the 13th century, would you? // '''Jens Persson''' ([[Special:Contributions/217.208.138.35|217.208.138.35]] ([[User talk:217.208.138.35|talk]]) 19:34, 20 May 2008 (UTC))

==Scanian dialects==
I have now twice removed the following section placed under "Dialects":
:''A note of importance should also be made to that of the accents from [[Scania]] in southern Sweden. Almost every town and or city in this region have their own way of speaking and pronoucning words. Almost everyone who has grown up in this area can tell just from an accent which town an other person grew up in. For example, people from [[Lund]] or [[Malmö]] might identify a person from [[Staffanstorp]] or [[Veberöd]] just by the way they pronounce different words, or create sentences, although these towns are located just 10km away from each other. This is quite extraordinary and people often make jokes among each other about how the way they pronounce words, or say certain things. However, swedes who in grow up in other parts of [[Sweden]], often can not distinguish between these different accents (or dialects) although they will always be able to determine that the person is from [[Scania]]. People from other parts of [[Sweden]] often have trouble understanding dialects from [[Scania]], especially the older generation, but to a lesser degree the younger generation which nowadays to a larger extent speak [[Standard Swedish]] with a bit of an accent.''

First off, this claim of uniqueness concerning the dialect situation in Scania is entirely unreferenced (see [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]). If Scanian dialects are this unique, there should be no prioblem verifying the claim with a reliable source. I don't know the details of the linguistic situation in Scania, but I do know that the ability to recognize dialects from neighboring towns or even villages can be found all over Sweden (see for example [[Elfdalian]]). The latter is also a very good example that Scanian is in no way unique in being difficult to understand for people from other parts of Sweden. In fact, Scanian is most likely fairly easy to understand for just about any Swede. While I'm sure there are certain people in [[Lund]] and [[Malmö]] that can identify the birthplace of another person by their dialect, I doubt this is applicable to even ''a significant minority'' of the population. Also, I'd recommend reading the article [[Standard Swedish]] a bit closer. By the linguistic definition of that term, the majority of Scanians could be considered speakers of the standard language.

The term thou-reform seems better than you-reform since "du" is after all historically speaking the same word as thou.

==Distribution map==
This is a good map, but the accuracy could perhaps be improved. Some areas are unicoloured while others consist of stripes. Adding a key would be good, as all readers now are left to guess the difference of these two areas. My guess would have been that the unicoloured areas would be areas where the proportion of native Swedish speakers is higher than in the areas with stripes. In that case, though, there are several errors. All of [[Tornedalen]] is unicoloured, despite the fact that a large proportion of the population speaks [[Meänkieli]]. All of[[Ostrobothnia]], on the other hand, is striped despite the fact that some municipalities in Ostrobothnia has got a higher proportion of native Swedish speakers than any municipality in Finland and thus would be the first to be unicoloured.
