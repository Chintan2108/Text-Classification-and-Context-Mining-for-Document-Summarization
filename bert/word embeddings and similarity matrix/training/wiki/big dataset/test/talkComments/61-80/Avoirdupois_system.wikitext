Changed the "French forms" list - removed modern English abbreviations, and made the French forms primary.
At least it doesn't now appear to say that twenty hundredweights make a tonne, which is just plain wrong.
Should the quarter really be in there?

:singular for "quinteaux" is "quintal", not "quinteau".I replaced it.

:I have no objection to "quintal" - that makes the plural "quintaux", though, surely? How about "quarter"? I can't see that as being French - modern cognate forms are "quart" and "quartier". Anyone know? Does it belong there at all? -- [[User:Ian Dalziel|Ian Dalziel]] 23:17, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== Peas again ==
"avoir du pois" does not mean "goods of weight." "Avoir" is the French infinitive of the verb "to have," "du" is a contracted form of "de le" which means "of the," and "pois" is "pea." It literally translates to "having a pea." My guess however, is that this in an incorrect form and the correct form would be "avoirdupoids." This translates exactly to "having weight" and is pronounced phonetically identically to "avoirdupois." In searching the web, I discovered many websites, particularly French language sites, that use the spelling "avoirdupoids." I am much too tired to fully research this, which is why I am not actually changing this article, but wanted to make a note that in either case the translation of the word in the article is incorrect, and that it is my belief that the correct form (and ergo title) should be "avoirdupoids." <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Nybgrus |Nybgrus ]] ([[User talk:Nybgrus |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nybgrus |contribs]]){{#if:{{{2|}}}|&#32;{{{2}}}|}}.</small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

:As the article says, the derivation is from OLD French - "peis", then "pois", which DOES mean "weight". -- [[User:Ian Dalziel|Ian Dalziel]] 12:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

::In French, ''avoir du poids'' definitely means ''To have some weight''. The deformation poids=>pois makes sense (''Poids'' comes from the Latin ''Pesum'', and gave also ''pesant'' i.e. ''weighting'' ). On the other hand, ''Avoir du pois'' (''Have one pea'') does not make sense at all as a French sentence.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Remi.chateauneu|Remi.chateauneu]] ([[User talk:Remi.chateauneu|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Remi.chateauneu|contribs]]) 12:23, 1 August 2012 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Avoir==

I'de just want to notice that in french "Avoir" can mean To have but it can sometime mean income or possession which would be "l'avoir" or "un avoir" I guess avoirdupois would much better means "income by weight"  but i guess "goods by weight" is pretty close, sometime it is just impossible to have a 100% accurate translation between 2 languages, if happen often when we try to translate expressions, I guess this is one case...

== Pound unit of force? ==

Generally, there's a difference between mass and weight.  Mass is the amount of matter an object has.  Weight is a measure of the amount of force exerted on the object by gravity.  A kilo is a kilo everywhere, Earth, Moon, or Jupiter, so a person with a mass of 80 kg will be 80 kg any of those places.  But, a pound is equivalent to 4.45 Newtons (N) a measure of force.  Hence, the 80 kg person would weigh 784 N on Earth or 176 lbs, but on the moon would weigh only 128 N or about 29 lbs. (Acceleration of gravity being about 9.8 m/s2 on Earth and 1.6 m/s2 on the Moon [ 80 kg * 9.8 m/s2 = 784 kg m/s2 = 784 N and: X lbs = 784 N * 1/4.45 N])

That being said, I think the old Imperial system does distinguish between a pound of mass and a pound of force, but I'm honestly not sure.  [[User:24.78.139.32|24.78.139.32]] 03:13, 24 October 2007 (UTC)Cheers, Peter-Jean
: See [[poundal]]. [[User:Mmm|Mmm]] 16:56, 24 October 2007 (UTC)

::"Pound" is a unit of 'weight'.  The quantity of weight existed before it was divided into 'force-of-weight' and 'inertia-of-weight' (aka 'mass').   In any case, it is generally understood that for any early use of 'weight', the proper method of comparison is by a beam balance, which relies on gM, as long as g is the same on both sides of a balance.  This is usually a problem only when one gets to eight places of significant digit.

::In any case, 'avoirdepoise' corresponds to what is called in German "Handelmass" (trade-weight), as opposed to the apothecaries and troy weights.  Avoirdepoise corresponds to those units for which the bulk of trade is regulated in. --[[User:Wendy.krieger|Wendy.krieger]] 08:23, 16 November 2007 (UTC)

:Is a frog an amphibian? You can argue with a biologist about this all day long, but you won't change the minds of people who make violin bows. Frog may be the name of an animal, but it's also the name of a part of a bow. Similarly "weight" has one meaning in physics, quite another in law, government, and commerce. The avoirdupois system is a legal system of mass units in the USA, Burma, and Liberia. Physicists do not use this system. [[User:Zyxwv99|Zyxwv99]] ([[User talk:Zyxwv99|talk]]) 18:58, 25 December 2011 (UTC)

::True enough they *avoid* it, but certainly physicists have used and do use it... if only as a matter of conversion.  The physics teachers/professors I've known happily pointed out that the English/avoirdupois unit for mass is the [[Slug_(mass)|slug]].  But I've never seen that unit outside a physics class, and using pounds as both force and mass seems to be vastly more common.  I have never seen "poundal" in use (for force) that I can recall. Seems like some clarification of the various usages might be useful.  That the pound is used in practice ambiguously as either force or mass, however, is definitely true, at least in the US. --[[User:Blue9292|Blue9292]] ([[User talk:Blue9292|talk]]) 01:18, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

== Mass ==
The Pound Unit of Force discussion above does not address the issue. The Avoirdupois article should not have the clause, "(or, properly, mass)." It is a measurement system of weight and not a measurement system of mass. The only mention of mass should be one disclaiming its relation to the Avoirdupois system of measurement. --[[Special:Contributions/72.10.223.116|72.10.223.116]] ([[User talk:72.10.223.116|talk]]) 04:19, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

: As described in the article, the pound is officially defined in terms of the kilogram, which is a measure of mass. So the maybe that clarification should be added earlier in the article. --[[User:Mmm|Mmm]] ([[User talk:Mmm|talk]]) 02:56, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

== Sack ==
The sack is here reported, as in various places such as Britannica, as being 26 stones (364 pounds). However, the [[wiktionary:sack|wiktionary entry]] puts it at 13 stones (182 pounds), along with a quotation to ''A History of Agriculture and Prices in England'', by [[James Edwin Thorold Rogers]]. This quotation is also in the articles on tod and stone. Is it a misquotation, or was the eminent economist mistaken?
Does anybody have access to the book? [[User:Ratfox|Ratfox]] ([[User talk:Ratfox|talk]]) 15:53, 23 May 2008 (UTC)
:I believe there was more than one sack. Hundreds possibly. In the 19th century we had a similar problem with barrels. Many states had their own apple barrels, beer barrels, wine barrels, etc. The 364-pound sack is the wool-sack, equal to 26 wool-stones of 14 wool-pounds each. The wool-pound is also known as the avoirdupois wool-pound or avoirdupois pound. The avoirdupois weight system was originally for weighing wool. Wool was once to England what oil is to Saudi Arabia (see [[Woolsack]]). All those other stones and sacks were for measuring something else. For example, the butchers' stone was for weighing meat.

I understand if ''you'' don't use it, or even if most of the people you know don't use it, but according to every reference I just checked (eight in all), Canada '''does''' officially use avoirdupois.

== English Pronunciation ==

I just wanted to bring it to your attention that the English pronunciation of ''avoirdupois'' given here is misleading both descriptively ''and'' prescriptively, at least if correctness is measured logically, by a word's phonetic value as pronounced by the majority of the speakers of a language. Though a minority of speakers might pronounce the word as described herein, in most standard dialects and registers of modern English, the correct pronunciation (and, yes, enunciation) is /ˌävərdəˈpwä/. While Merriam-Webster, for instance, will agree with the pronunciation given here, most other dictionaries (online and hard-copy) show the aforementioned way as proper, including (significantly) the OED, which most linguists and English language students will recognize as being the definitive reference where lexicon and phonetics are concerned. To verify my suspicions I also consulted the ''TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus'', the ABNC (''Audio British National Corpus'') and the CEC (''Cambridge English Corpus''). It is my belief that four works of reference, including three prestigious English language corpora, are enough. In summation, I mean no offense, but simply wanted to inform whomever it may concern, as I cherish Wikipedia (and its offspring), tend to believe its articles and abhor those fools that have no faith whatsoever in its veracity. Eventually I'd like to contribute to the site myself. I've donated to the Foundation in the past, but would like to write and/or edit as well, holding that if one is happy for having access to something so beautiful, it is not only his/her duty but honor to contribute to its continued success. Alas, right now I lack the time to do so, but wanted to at ''least'' contribute '''something'''. =)  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2602:306:CE20:9900:44DC:DDC0:712C:47C7|2602:306:CE20:9900:44DC:DDC0:712C:47C7]] ([[User talk:2602:306:CE20:9900:44DC:DDC0:712C:47C7|talk]]) 04:19, 7 September 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
