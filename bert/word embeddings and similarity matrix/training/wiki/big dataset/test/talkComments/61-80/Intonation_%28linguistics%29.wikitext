Can anyone expand on the explanation of the notation that can be used to record intonation (IPA or otherwise)? [[User:128.12.20.195|128.12.20.195]] 04:42, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

The claim that Chickashaw uses rises for statements and falls for questions should perhaps be accompanied by a reference (Gussenhoven?) since there is no mention of this on the links to Chickashaw language and this is not a widely known fact.

The two "diagonal arrow" symbols both appear as the same white square (empty box) symbol on my screen.  I'm using IE 7, with pretty standard settings.

:Sadly, IE isn't good at font substitution. It works fine in Firefox. If you figure out what fonts they appears in, we can wrap the arrows in <code>&lt;span></code> tags that force one of those fonts … [[User:Ruakh|Ruakh]] 14:48, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

== Hungarian intonation ==

Random trivia: In Hungarian, you make a yes/no question by making the last two syllables rise and fall--"ment a vonat" means the train has left; intoned "ment a VOnat" it asks, has the train left?

== Rise and fall ==
According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_rising_terminal, "most sentences using a Wh-interrogative rise and then fall at the end." [[User:69.210.78.205|69.210.78.205]] 06:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

== Merge==
Shouldn't this article be merged with [[Tone (linguistics)]]? The concepts are virtually the same. [[User:Rsazevedo|Rsazevedo]] <sup> [[User Talk:Rsazevedo|msg]]</sup> 16:49, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
:No. They are completely different concepts. This would be like merging [[vowel]] and [[formant]]. [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 17:16, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
::Well, the articles certainly don't convey that difference in the concepts. They definitely need reworking then. [[User:Rsazevedo|Rsazevedo]] <sup> [[User Talk:Rsazevedo|msg]]</sup> 17:41, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Agreed. Currently, Intonation is described as a type of pitch and then this article talks about uses of pitch in Chinese. It neglects to address the most important information about intonation: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTONATION AND PITCH? Anyone who reads this will have the same question. I came here to see just that, and Wikipedia is offering nothing as of now...  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.61.179.133|71.61.179.133]] ([[User talk:71.61.179.133|talk]]) 08:58, 14 December 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Dubious tag on "dunno"==

The article currently says, in the section "Lexicalized intonation":

:''English intonation may become semi-lexicalized in common expressions such as "dunno" ([I] don't know)''

I dunno about that -- to me the intonation of "dunno", by itself or at the end of a sentence, seems to be the same as in "I forget" -- low on the first syllable, then high-start-with-a-dropoff on the stressed final syllable. And in the middle of a sentence, "dunno" and "forget" both seem the same again -- low on the first syllable, then medium on the stressed second syllable.  Can someone justify the assertion in the text? [[User:Duoduoduo|Duoduoduo]] ([[User talk:Duoduoduo|talk]]) 15:42, 18 July 2011 (UTC)

I think the intention here was the hummed mumble "I'unno" or "I dunno". It's basically the intonation of "I dunno" said (really hummed) without opening your mouth. It's incredibly common among English speakers and is often accompanied by a shrug. Actually, there's a quick mention of it on the page for [[shrug]]: "In the English-speaking world it may be accompanied by a three syllable grunt or hummed mumble mimicking the intonation of 'I dunno'."  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.136.237.59|74.136.237.59]] ([[User talk:74.136.237.59|talk]]) 18:46, 21 March 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Male-female intonation differences==

The article [[Gender-neutral language]] says in its last sentence, without a source:

:''...intonation differs between men and women in many languages....''

Is this true? If so, with elaboration it would make an excellent addition to the present article.  [[User:Duoduoduo|Duoduoduo]] ([[User talk:Duoduoduo|talk]]) 15:49, 18 July 2011 (UTC)

== Intonation in English ==

I want to rewrite the "Intonation in English" section, if nobody objects. At the moment, the material is presented in terms of the traditional American 4-pitch-level system and it is not made clear that this is not generally used by European linguists, and is widely regarded as outdated. I won't delete that material, though it could do with a bit of improving from the readability point of view, but I'd like to add some stuff about British analyses, about modern American work using ToBI and other European descriptions of English.  [[User:RoachPeter|RoachPeter]] ([[User talk:RoachPeter|talk]]) 14:33, 18 January 2013 (UTC)
::I find the article's opening definitional sentence confusing. Does it hold water? The difference between tone and intonation (if one is indeed supported widely in the literature) needs to be clarified. For example, the opening para of ''Intonation in English'' morphs into a quite different frame (pitch). And I'm unsure of how authoritative Cecle-Murcia et al. is ... it's a textbook for second-language speakers, isn't it? [[User:Tony1|<font color="darkgreen">'''Tony'''</font >]] [[User talk:Tony1|<font color="darkgreen">(talk) </font >]] 08:06, 22 January 2013 (UTC)
:::OK, I've made a lot of changes to the "Intonation in English" section and added a Bibliography. I will now go on to rewrite the opening section so that i) definition of intonation, ii) transcription of intonation and iii) functions of intonation are properly separated (they are rather muddled together at the moment).  BTW, Celce-Murcia et al is a textbook on the teaching of English pronunciation which contains a lot of useful observations about English phonetics [[User:RoachPeter|RoachPeter]] ([[User talk:RoachPeter|talk]]) 18:26, 16 February 2013 (UTC)

::::::That was a great improvement to the article! Do you think you can also add some things about how American and British intonations in themselves differ? I mean, the academic transcription is different, but even British intonation itself goes up and down more than in American (I think, at least). It's one of the most important differences between the two Englishes, maybe even more so than pronunciation.

:::::::Halliday and Grieves make points about this. From memory, North American English has a slight tendency towards more pronounced intonation, with considerable variety between individual speakers—perhaps more than the difference between the transatlantic averages. Text read aloud has more pronounced intonation, I believe. But I haven't looked at their refs, which would be interesting; nor have I gone back to the particular sections I'm recalling. Will have time soon to discuss more on this talk page.

== Level intonation ==

Someone has just deleted "Level intonation" from the list at line 22.  I don't feel I should just revert this change straight away, but there are many accounts of English intonation that give a role (albeit a minor one) to level tone alongside falls, rises etc. I suppose that if Level is reinstated it should be with some examples.

== French (continuation pattern) ==

At present we have:
:*''Hier ↗soir, il m'a off↗ert une ciga↘rette.'' (The English equivalent would be "Last eve↗ning, he offered ↗me a cigar↘ette.")
The English intonation given here is clearly wrong – should be: Last ↗evening, he ↗offered me a ciga↘rette (BrE) / ↘cigarette (AmE). Furthermore and in any case, is an "English equivalent" really necessary in this description of an aspect of French? I propose simply removing it. -- [[User:Picapica|Picapica]] ([[User talk:Picapica|talk]]) 05:59, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
