== Records ==

A useful addition to this entry is the normal ranges of atmospheric pressures. From a little research
it appears the the maximum recorded atmospheric pressure was 
in Siberia at 1200 GMT on 31 December 1968: 32.01 in (1083.8 mb). 
See http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.99.pressure.html

The lowest recorded pressure appears to be in the 920mb area. See
http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.lowpressurefollowup.html

::([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 10:17, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)) Can I query this a bit? Presumably, these are SLP's. Well the pacific one clearly is. But the Mongolian one can't be, Mongolia being quite high up. So it must be station pressure reduced to sea level (unless its really an actual reading♥ - unlikely) and reduction to sea level is fraught with difficulties, ie the temperature profile that gets assumed under the ground.

:::The book didn't specifically say sea level equivalent, but it notes the same Siberian measurement (which ''is'' sea level equivalent per the on-line reference) as the second highest pressure recorded. [[User:Duk|Duk]] 17:55, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::::Note I have reduced the precision values of the millibar values. Pressure measurement to 0.01 millibar precision, particularly at the centre of a typhoon, is unrealistic.

== FIX ME: Bad use of units ==
The article refers to the unit Newton in an unappropriate manner in several sections, for example: "column of air would weigh about 100 kilonewtons". Kn (kilonewton) is a measure of force, not of mass, which we is what we use the unit gram (g) for. Could someone please correct this?  small Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by[[Special:Contributions/130.243.234.161|130.243.234.161]] ([[User talk:130.243.234.161|talk]]) 14:34, 27 July 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
  There is no problem at all using the Newton as a unit of "weight".  Its the correct measure for the gravitational force between the object and the earth.  I do have a quibble with describing the weight of the atmosphere as 65 Newtons per square inch, though.[[User:Eregli bob|Eregli bob]] [User talk:Eregli bob|talk] 15:02, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

@Victor Engel
You deleted a useful statement in the introduction "Equivalently, every square centimetre supports about 1kg of air." The stated reason is "force is not mass". Where does the statement assume that force is mass? "To support a mass" is scientifically correct. Indeed, it is more correct to state mass (1kg) than force (10N) because if the Earth were hollow, say, there would still be 1kg for every cm2 but much less than 10N. Secondly, 95% of the world would prefer to see SI units in the introduction and 1kg/1cm2 happens to be more memorable than 14.7lbf/sqin. Thirdly, if you're worried that readers would mix force with mass, then you should have corrected the 1kg to 10N instead of deleting it completely.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.133.32.227|78.133.32.227]] ([[User talk:78.133.32.227|talk]]) 13:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: What I actually corrected was: "A column of air one square inch in cross-section, measured from sea level to the top of the atmosphere, would weigh approximately 14.7 lbf (65 N); equivalently, every square centimetre supports about 1kg of air." The word "equivalently" is implying that 14.7 lb (not sure what the f is there for -- it's not torque) over 1 square inch is the equivalent of 1kg over a square centimetre. They are not equivalent. While it's just fine to talk about a mass being supported by an area, that is not what's being done with the imperial units. The pound is a unit of force, not mass. [[User:Victor Engel|Victor Engel]] ([[User talk:Victor Engel|talk]]) 19:35, 20 May 2011 (UTC)

:: Perhaps the f was to distinguish pound-force from pound-mass, which, if you couldn't already tell from context, further shows that force, and not mass was being described, and thus the counterpart needed also to be about force. Alternatively, both sides could have been about mass. [[User:Victor Engel|Victor Engel]] ([[User talk:Victor Engel|talk]]) 19:47, 20 May 2011 (UTC)

==Error in article?==
Hi, maybe I'm being stupid, but this statement appears to be inconsistent: "A column of air one square centimetre in cross-section, measured from sea level to the top of the atmosphere, has a mass of about a kilogram and a weight of 63N". A mass of 1 kilo at sea level has a weight of 10N. If the mass is distributed over a range of heights, then since gravity decreases above sea level, the weight must be lower than 10N. Am I missing something? [[User:Dilaudid|Dilaudid]] ([[User talk:Dilaudid|talk]]) 19:23, 15 July 2011 (UTC)


I have just caught this and the claim about mass and force are wrong. Mass = volume x density and Force (Newtons) = density x height of column x gravity (9.8 m s^2). 
Density of air at sea level is generally accepted as being 1.225 kg m^3. If therefore the height of the atmosphere is 100 km or 100000 m this would give a FORCE at sea level of 1.225 x 100000 x 9.8 = 1200500 Newtons or 1200.5 kilo Newtons. It is after all just 
Basic physics!!!
:You are ignoring the fact that density varies significantly with altitude. Basic Physics![[Special:Contributions/24.108.28.165|24.108.28.165]] ([[User talk:24.108.28.165|talk]]) 06:40, 24 May 2015 (UTC)

==Significant figures==
760 is equivalent to 14.696 but only to the number of decimal places?!! Nonsense and gibberish!  3 decimal place accuracy can NOT EVER be equivalent to 5 decimal place accuracy.  It is called "significant figures" and can be found in any high school science class.  Perhaps the writers need a refresh, or more likely a first time exposure.  Also use of the depreciated english unit stone for a square inch column is by far the most egregious example of insularism I've seen on Wiki: 1) Stone has been depreciated 2) a pound per square inch is not only a USA standard, but is well understood throughout the world.  When is the last time anybody used a stone per in² ?!?! and 3)  As a question - does anybody use the stone when referring to weights (or is it masses?) on the order of 1 stone?  I doubt it is intuitive or helpful but I'm a yank so IDK, finally 4) when you're speaking about atmosphere BY DEFINITION altitude is implicated.  Now stick with me here, it will be a giant leap for some of the contributors: when you're speaking about altitude, g (defined at sea level), the standard acceleration CONSTANT is inapplicable.  Therefore it is no longer the case that weight and mass are interchangeable by the use of a simple conversion factor (there is a 1/r² involved - again High School physics).  g is only applicable at sea level (and I'm not sure how g relates to the actual average acceleration at sea level on dry land since the actual force depends on the density of the Earth at any given point.  I started this to fix the "cute" but IMHO less than helpful use of stone rather than 14.7 psi, but came across this other junk along the way and I found that there is no obvious way for me to fix that first introductory section, so any volunteers?[[Special:Contributions/69.40.254.72|69.40.254.72]] ([[User talk:69.40.254.72|talk]]) 16:51, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

some effects: pilots in military jets feel sometimes toothache as pressure changes rapidly.


I'm sure this must have other causes. An air pressure, as 'invented' by Otto of Guericke, as a<br> clue for his hemispheres attempt might not be existing in this nature on the planet.

:Yes, yes it does. This is only anecdotal (which is why im not putting in the articel) But I'm a great example. From the ages of 0-20 I lived in deserts; the cold and hot ones west of the rocky mountains. I would get dizzy with vertigo in places like Wyoming. But then, I moved to kentucky. Until this i had never had problems with rain. But ever since ive been here, every single time it rains i get hellish migraines. Ive never had a migraine (though always had headaches) in any of the other places west of the rockies ive lived.
:Today (more anecdotal) I woke up with a migraine and did not know why. The sky was perfectly clear! And then about..3,4 hours later it rapidly became overcast. I more or less (mostly less) predicted a non obvious change in weather because of the pressure in my head. Anyway, thats just my experience. No real evidence to back it up, but im sure someone whos having less of a migraine than me can find it. (also sorry for weird wording. I have a migraine.)

== Other planets ==

An extension of the article considering the atmospheric pressure on other planets, notably mars, would be interesting, as a low atmosperic pressure diminuishes the temperature range where water can exist in liquid form.

From phase diagrams found randomly on the internet (and evaluated by moving the thumb) it looks like the average body temperature of a terrestrial bird would be sufficient to boil liquid water given the pressure of the martian amosphere. [[User:84.160.201.148|84.160.201.148]] 11:00, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

Sure, the water in the martian atmosphere starts boiling well below the body temperature. But that doesn't mean that the blood in a human body boils instantly when someone is exposed to the martian atmosphere. For a while the pressure inside the body is a lot higher than outside. If you ever be exposed to martian atmosphere you suffocate long before your blood boiled away :-). You won't explode either. But your lung might be ruptured if you hold your breath before you are exposed.

A similar effect, but less of course, is if you ever climb the Mount Everest. The pressure on the top is just one third of the amount on sea level. At this low pressure your cup of coffee will never be more than 70 degrees celsius, because it boils away above that temperature. So, you never burn yourself because you coffee was too hot :-). --[[User:Lucius1976|Lucius1976]] 17:56, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

*i dont think the introduction sentence is very good

''Atmospheric pressure is the pressure above any area in the Earth's atmosphere caused by the weight 
of air. Standard atmospheric pressure (atm) is discussed in the next section.''

considering other planetary masses have atmospheric pressures as well... such has Venus and mars. this makes it sound like if I say oh the atmospheric pressure is .6 KPA then... its on earth, when i could be referring to mars. [[User:Barcode|Barcode]] 16:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

It say standard pressure is 100,000 Pa = 1 bar = 750 Torr, and then goes on to say that "This can also be stated as: [..] 1013.25 millibars" which is obviously wrong; being the value for 1 Atm and not 1 bar. --[[User:BluePlatypus|BluePlatypus]] 04:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== Frustrated -this page needs useful information. ==

Unfortunately, this page was not at all helpful to me. You atmospheric scientists likely know all this as obvious, but to those of us who aren't, please help us out. This info. should be easy to find here.

Specifically:
* A formula for converting height to air pressure (absolute), i.e. pressure=10^(5-height/15500); pressure is in Pascals, height is in meters above sea level.
* A formula for converting air pressure (gauge) to height, i.e.
* A formula for converting height to air pressure (gauge), i.e. 
* A formula for converting air pressure (absolute) to height, i.e.

(I didn't write the formulae, and don't want to spend a few days working them out. They should be here to save everyone this work, right?)
:The formula you're looking for is there.  Unfortunately the relationship between altitude and pressure is strongly dependent on temperature, which varies with altitude in a way that does not lend itself to a single formula applicable to all altitudes.  This variability is dealt with by dividing the atmosphere up into layers and modeling the temperature as being linearly dependent on altitude within each layer, with different layers having different dependencies, along with a separate base pressure for each layer.  The table in [[Atmospheric pressure#Calculating_variation_with_altitude]] gives the base pressure and temperature dependence (base and lapse) for each layer, along with a single formula applicable equally to five of the layers, the other two requiring a slightly different formula because their temperature is constant over the whole layer (i.e. zero lapse rate).  What you want is there, you just have to accept that the irregular variability of temperature necessitates dividing up the atmosphere in this way.  --[[User:Vaughan Pratt|Vaughan Pratt]] ([[User talk:Vaughan Pratt|talk]]) 09:08, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

I removed the following section from the end of the article:

: For the very simple reason that introducing two different versions of the same number (i.e. metric vs US) could cause an accident if the wrong altimeter setting was selected.  It is far simpler to just pick one, which in this case happens to be inches since so many of the international flights into and out of Canada either originate or terminate in the US.  Thankfully the US FAA has slowly been changing toward ICAO standards, so maybe sometime in the future we will start to see US flights (and Canadian) given their baro settings in hPa instead of inches.

== Pressure vs. altitude ==

I don't recommend that anyone use the equations given for pressure vs. altitude without checking them very carefully. The user who posted them seems to have converted the units of the universal gas constant incorrectly; there may be other conversion errors etc. Strangely, even the US standard which is cited for this material uses SI units for the universal gas constant. I don't understand why the editor felt it useful to convert them. I haven't reviewed the whole standard, though, so perhaps there was a good reason for it. Ideally, the whole section should be scrapped and replaced with a ''cited'' calculation in SI units.

They are the equations specified by the U.S. Standard Atmosphere of 1976 which was cited.  The basic formulae remain the same; only the units changed.  It is not [[original research]].  It is a simple conversion from metric to standard.  The conversion factors are very old and are well-published (refer to NASA SP-7012, ''The International System of Units: Physical Constants and Conversion Factors'').  I edited the chart to reflect both SI units and English units.  It should now be useful for people who utilize SI units as well as people (like myself) who still use English units.  The conversion of the gas constant for air is correct.  The conversion is simply "SI units / 0.3048^2"  OR  "8.31432 x 10^3 N m /(kmol K) divided by 0.3048^2"  (note that 0.3048^2 is the conversion factor of square meters to square feet).  The only weird thing about all of this is that the U.S. Standard Atmosphere of 1976 uses the value 8.31432x10^3 as the gas constant for air which it admits is not consistent with the cited values of the Avogadro number and Boltzmann's constant.  Still though, it uses this value for all it's calculations.  The effect of this disparity is negligible (less than 0.08 pascals at 35,000 feet and less than 0.00004 pascals at 250,000 feet) and, in any event, it really does not matter because the actual pressure/temperature at any given altitude is rarely the same as the value in the tables.  (Just as the actual pressure and temperature at sea level are rarely 1013.25 mb and 15 degrees celsius on any given day).  Still though, it is a realistic, usable average.  Additionally, all aircraft flight instruments (worldwide) are calibrated using the same Standard Atmosphere as the reference.  Therefore, all altimeters are equally "inaccurate".  I feel English units should remain in this article because they are still widely used today.  Instrument shops in the United States use inches of murcury and feet when calibrating altimeters; not pascals, millibars or meters.  The current, active military standard (MIL-STD-859, ''Standard Calibration Table For Aeronautical Pressure Measuring Equipment'') is tabulated in feet and inches of mercury.  Also, the equipment used to calibrate the altimeters are themselves calibrated using feet and inches of mercury (refer to Air Force technical order 33D7-3-60-71).  In Europe, however, they use SI units.  The chart in the article now shows both so everyone should be happy.  It should also be mentioned that the U.S. Standard Atmosphere of 1976 is identical to the ICAO standard up to 32 km and the ISO standard up to 50 km.

I think there's no problem using English units as well, but aren't the English using degrees Fahrenheit in stead of Kelvins, ounces in stead of grams and pounds in stead of kilograms? (Well, the latter two are nitpicking, since they only occur in constants, but then, L is (partially!) converted as well.)  Another point is this: does the model rather than just a mean value also give an error (''e.g.'' standard deviation)?  The example calculation looks suspiciously accurate to me.  [[User:Vdsluys|Sluys]] ([[User talk:Vdsluys|talk]]) 16:29, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

The "English" use the SI system in almost every day life and have done for a number of years. Fuel is bought in litres, food is bought in kilogrammes, water is used by the cubic metre, weight is depending on the person either kilogrammes or stones, pounds and ounces, rainfall and snow fall is measured in centimetres, linear distance for motor vehicles is measured in miles., but government departments use the SI - or metric system for everything.

==   Variation in thickness of the Earth's atmosphere ==

Mountaineers are interested to know more about the variation in barometric pressure due to the varying thickness of the Earth's atmosphere. I think this thickness variation is due to centrifugal force effects of the Earth's rotation.

Specifically, mountaineers would like to know:

What is the variation in sea level barometric pressure between the pressure at the equator and:<br />
a)10 deg latitude<br />
b)20 deg latitude<br />
c)30 deg latitude<br />
d)40 deg latitude<br />
e)50 deg latitude<br />
f)60 deg latitude<br />
g)70 deg latitude<br />
h)80 deg latitude<br />
i)90 deg latitude<br />

DO ANY OF THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE EQUATIONS TAKE LATITUDE INTO ACCOUNT?
Would the variation be about the same for the northern versus southern latitudes?


These pressure differences are related to items of interest to mountaineers such as:

Is the air less dense at the summit of Denali (20,320') than on Aconcagua (22,841') due to the higher latitude?

Chimborazo(20,000'+)is on the Equator in Ecuador. Thus it sits on the "bulge" caused by the Earth's rotation and is said to be the summit farthest from the center of the earth. Which effect is greater on the density of the atmosphere on Chimborazo: the "height" due to the bulge, or the greater thickness of the atmosphere at the Equator? In other words, would the air on Chimborazo be less dense if it were located at higher latitude?

On a high summit, say 20,000', would the air be more dense on a cold day or a warm day? (It would seem that if it were warm, the atmosphere would expand and more air would be above you so the pressure would be greater. Conversely it would seem that on a cold day, the air would be dense and would contract, thus more of the total atmosphere would be below your 20,000' location and so the pressure would be less at your 20,000' location.)


Can someone add more info on this topic to the main article? [[User:Ice axe 2|Ice axe 2]] 20:36, 31 August 2007 (UTC)


>> "I think this thickness variation is due to centrifugal force effects of the Earth's rotation."  The centrifugal force makes a difference in the Earth's gravitational constant g of only about 0.4%, so it does not explain the much larger difference in pressure. This is due instead to the difference in solar heating and air circulation. In general, pressure causes gas to distribute evenly, but presses downwards due to gravity. Thus the air in Denali should be less dense than Aconcagua due to the higher altitude, subject to weather variations. Strictly speaking, one should consider the altitude from the geoid, rather than sea level, although the two are almost the same. Chimborazo may be the farthest from the Earth's center but that is irrelevant; it is not the highest from sea level. Note also that barometric pressure is not proportional to atmospheric height above it; it also depends on whether the air is rising/falling, its temperature etc.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.133.92.236|78.133.92.236]] ([[User talk:78.133.92.236|talk]]) 09:34, 25 July 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I removed the image at the top of the page because it didn't illustrate the article and was confusing. The items on the graph were not identified, and it was unclear what was even being represented.

:Yes, but... the image is still referenced in the text of section "Local atmospheric pressure variation."

== More generalized case ==

I've been trying to work out a formula similar to those in the article, relating change in pressure to change in altitude, for cases in which the change in the acceleration of gravity varies significantly enough to be taken into account. For a first step, I'd assume the mass of the atmosphere between the two altitudes to be insignificant, i.e. the source of gravity could be considered a point source. Since, assuming I do work it out, it apparently couldn't be included as original research, if anyone can find a well-sourced formula for this and include it, that might be appreciated by some, certainly myself.

I think expressed as a function, it might look something like <math>P(m,r,M,T)</math>, with the variables being pressure, mass of central object, distance from central object (both radius for gravity, and used as altitude), molar mass of gas, and temperature. Constants involved would be G and R, the gravitational and gas constants. Bonus points if you can account for a temperature lapse rate, too. -- [[User:JohnOwens|J.

== Calculating Variation With Altitude ==

Not all land areas are at or above sea level.  Some are significantly below sea level, like the Dead Sea region.  I think it might be useful for this section to make some mention of whether the variation in air pressure below sea level is consistent with the variation above, i.e. would you add the same amount of air pressure at 400 meters below sea level as you would subtract at 400 meters above?

== Journey to Center of Earth ==

While most of us grownups know that a shaft to the center of the earth is pure fantasy, many movie watchers, young and old, are curious about the "what if" scenario. What if you fell into a shaft thousands of miles deep? How much would the air pressure increase? Would the pressure be great enough to turn the air to liquid or solid? What would the pressure do to your terminal velocity? How much would the air temperature increase (if insulated from the surrounding magma)? How far and how long would you fall before the heat and pressure kill you? If you're not baked and vaporized by the temperatures, how long would it take to reach the bottom? 

Any valid formula for air above sea level would have to be modified to account for gravity directly proportional to r (distance from the center), rather than inversely proportional to r<sup>2</sup>. You might also want to account for variations in density of the surrounding rock or magma. These adjustments could have some validity in planetary science, such as creating a habitat inside a moon or asteroid. 

I'm not a mathematician, and I haven't really analysed the formulas used to develop the tables for altitudes above sea level. However, I suspect they all ignore the 3D aspect of the atmosphere. I think they calculate the weight of a prism of air above the unit area. In fact, a one-meter square at sea level (r = 6,738 km) must support a '''pyramid''' of air whose horizontal cross section at 6.378 km is 1.002001 m<sup>2</sup>. Perhaps this is negligible for aeronautical purposes, but for a shaft to the center of the Earth, it would make a huge difference.

=="Reduced to sea level" needs explanation==
The phrase "reduced to sea level" appears in this article several times.  I can guess that it means taking the pressure measurement gathered at a particular location and elevation, and then calculating what the measurement  would be if one could dig down to sea level at the current location.  I'd like to see this spelled out, including whatever variations in this method are salient  It's particularly important since this calculation will generally result in a pressure value that is larger, not smaller as the term "reduced" might suggest.

== Units ==

There's little consistency in this article in terms of which units to use. For example, in the lead we have both "14.7 lbf (65 N)" - US followed by metric - and "1 m2 (11 sq ft)" - metric followed by US. The "Atmospheric pressure records" section appears to use US units exclusively. The "Boiling point of water" section, like the lead, has both US-then-metric ("3,500 ft (1,100 m)") and metric-then-US ("100 °C (212 °F)"). Given that this is a scientific article, I would suggest standardising on metric-then-US throughout, as metric is what scientists use and it's already predominant in the article.

"Over the area of your body, there is about 1,000 kg of air; this is approximately the same as having a small car press down on you." It's obvious nonsense.

== history of metric units ==

* "a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimetre (cm2), measured from mean (average) sea level to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a mass of about 1.03 kilogram"

It is a remarkable coincidence that standard atmospheric pressure is almost exactly 1.0 kg/cm*cm. Please add a history note, either that it really is just a coincidence -- or that the kg and cm units were somehow adjusted / defined in relation to atmosphere pressure.-[[Special:Contributions/73.61.15.12|73.61.15.12]] ([[User talk:73.61.15.12|talk]]) 20:38, 3 April 2018 (UTC)
:It's a coincidence, and we don't need to comment on it. Read the linked articles if you want to see how kilograms, Newtons and are connected. [[User:Meters|Meters]] ([[User talk:Meters|talk]]) 22:28, 3 April 2018 (UTC)

== Std atm pressure eq 5 mi air column, Mt Everest ==

* What is the height of air column which will produce a pressure of 1atm?
: 'If you consider density of air 1.225 kg/m^3 (near sea level at 15 degree celcius and also consider it not changing with altitude), by substituting the values you will get height of around 8.44 km."

If air density did not decrease with altitude, a column of air just over 5 miles high (5.25 mi) would be equivalent to standard sea level pressure -- just slightly less than the height of Mt. Everest (5.5 mi).-[[Special:Contributions/73.61.15.12|73.61.15.12]] ([[User talk:73.61.15.12|talk]]) 21:08, 3 April 2018 (UTC)
:See [[WP:NOTAFORUM]]. And if you are suggesting that this  should go in the article, then I disagree. [[User:Meters|Meters]] ([[User talk:Meters|talk]]) 22:34, 3 April 2018 (UTC)
