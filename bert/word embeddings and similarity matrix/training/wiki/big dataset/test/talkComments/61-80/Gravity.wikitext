== Opening sentence needs reconsidering ==
:Gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with energy are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including stars, planets, galaxies and even light and sub-atomic particles.

While the mention of "with energy" may be technically correct due to mass/energy equivalence, it is much too confusing for the ordinary reader to drop this into the opening sentence without any further (at this point) explanation. [[Special:Contributions/31.49.180.255|31.49.180.255]] ([[User talk:31.49.180.255|talk]]) 01:57, 26 September 2016 (UTC)

::I absolutely agree.  This is a good example of a common problem on WP technical articles; editors generalizing the first sentence until it is incomprehensible.  There are many better ways to state this point in the intro, which a good writer would use; for example: 
:::"''Gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with [[mass]] are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including stars, planets, and galaxies.  Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy such as light are also included.''"
::Another dweeby example of bad writing in this introduction is:
:::"''Gravity is responsible for many of the structures in the Universe, by creating spheres of hydrogen — where hydrogen fuses under pressure to form stars — and grouping them into galaxies''"
::Gravity doesn't ''create'' spheres of hydrogen out of nothing, does it?  Read the sentence as if you are a non-technically-educated reader, and that's what it seems to mean.  Instead, why can't we just say:
:::"''The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter in the universe caused it to collapse together, forming stars — and the stars to group together into galaxies — so gravity is responsible for the large scale structures in the Universe.''"
::This lead paragraph sounds like it was written by a teenage [[Sheldon Cooper]], not a competent science writer. Seriously, come on. --<font color="blue">[[User:Chetvorno|Chetvorno]]</font><sup>''<small>[[User talk:Chetvorno|<font color="Purple">TALK</font>]]</small>''</sup> 03:37, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
::: I don't agree with the first one. Light has no mass, so suggesting that it can be "included" in "all things with mass", would be a bad idea. It ''can'' be included in "all things that gravitate or that cause and are under the influence of gravitation", but not in all things with mass. In order to avoid circularity we can't of course mention gravity or gravitation. Perhaps there is another way to state the point correctly, but I think that the the current wording is very okay. It invites the ordinary reader who might expect ''mass'' here, to be somewhat puzzled and by all means go on reading. - [[User:DVdm|DVdm]] ([[User talk:DVdm|talk]]) 08:44, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
::::Your proposed version would be fine with me:
:::::"''Gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with [[mass]] are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including stars, planets, and galaxies.  Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy such as light are also under the influence of gravitation.''"
::::I don't object to a sentence that gravitation acts on "all things with energy"; I just don't think it should be the lead sentence.  I just think the intro shouldn't be 'puzzling' the readers; this subject is already puzzling enough for nontechnical people.  "[[WP:EXPLAINLEAD|It is particularly important for the lead section to be understandable to a broad readership.]]" (WP:EXPLAINLEAD) "[[MOS:LEAD|Do not hint at startling facts without describing them.]]" (MOS:LEAD) "[[WP:ASTONISH|The average reader should not be shocked, surprised, or overwhelmingly confused by your article.]]" (WP:ASTONISH)   "[[MOS:INTRO|[The lead] should not "tease" the reader by hinting at but not explaining important facts that will appear later in the article.]]" (MOS:INTRO)  Many general readers with no scientific education come to this page just wanting the simplest, most understandable explanation of gravity.  I think the current confusing lead sentence will just discourage them. --<font color="blue">[[User:Chetvorno|Chetvorno]]</font><sup>''<small>[[User talk:Chetvorno|<font color="Purple">TALK</font>]]</small>''</sup> 21:17, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
::::: The amended phrase "''all forms of energy such as light are also under the influence of gravitation''" is almost fine. I'd add something to make it complete:
::::::"''Gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with [[mass]] are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including stars, planets, and galaxies.  Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy such as light also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it.''"
::::: Do you see another acceptable way to say that these forms are also sources of gravitation? - [[User:DVdm|DVdm]] ([[User talk:DVdm|talk]]) 21:27, 26 September 2016 (UTC)
FWIW - Perhaps the following wording may be better? =><br>
* Suggestion-1: ''"'''Gravity''', or '''gravitation''', is a [[natural environment|natural]] [[force]] with which all things with [[mass]] are brought toward one another (including [[planet]]s, [[star]]s and [[galaxies]]).

I disagree with the suggested changes to the wording of the first sentence.  I think the sentence as written accurately and succinctly establishes the more universally accepted notion that gravity is associated with energy rather than the traditionally referred to notion of mass.  Even to the average reader, this article establishes correctly, right from the get-go, that to understand gravity in the present age, gravity is not a force, but rather a phenomenon, and that Newton's laws were approximations superseded by the more universal Theory of Relativity.  [[User:SquashEngineer|SquashEngineer]] ([[User talk:SquashEngineer|talk]]) 15:42, 28 September 2016 (UTC)

But it is clear from [[User:31.49.180.255|31.49.180.255]]'s and [[User:Drbogdan|Drbogdan]]'s comments that the concept of energy gravitating is unfamiliar to many (undoubtedly most) readers and I think it needs to be explained or stated explicitly, not "sprung" on them without explanation in the lead sentence.

I think [[User:Drbogdan|Drbogdan]]'s Suggestion-1 wording above would be fine, and I could live with his Suggestion-2.

: Hm, I certainly wouldn't do that. After all, in general relativity, which is our best model of gravity, it is not a force at all. So it's probably better to be neutral here and leave all options open by just using the generic ''natural phenomenon'', which is then explicitised to ''force'' and ''spacetime curvature'' later in the article, depending on the context.

The Earth's strong gravitational force simply doesn't allow two objects as small as dice to react to their gravitational forces, but if they are placed in non-gravitational environment, they will simply collide.

== gravity "OR" gravitation ... ==

so what does "gravity center" [rigid body] and "special gravity" [i.e. mass density] mean (if it's not weight)? gravity means being grave (heavy). if we draw force vector between,  it starts from weighted body (i.e. gravity) and ends to gravitator (here, earth). gravitation [: making heavy] acts on gravities, while electra and magnet make phenomena by itself: magnet makes magnetism, electra does electricity, but gravitation is "seen on" gravities. in comparison, gravitation, magnetization and electrification are in the same row.  <br>

== [[Leonard Susskind]] is very generic sometimes ==
[[Motion]] is [[information]]. The [[black hole]] limits the motion of particles, so we have jets which dissipate that [[relativity|relative to it's surroundings]] [[theory of information|information]]. Gravitational systems, are constituted of objects which slowly have their particles complexity degrading. A gravitational system, forces it's components to lose information. That means that all atoms in a gravitational group, tend to have slightly closer spin values, and slightly closer time-flow pace (relative timing among particles). The information isn't lost. It's simply transformed into motion. A gravitational system is very hard to describe, because it has many components, but if we await, we then can describe with fewer pages the characteristics of the particles''''except from their relative speed'''. Dark energy is a result of quantum fluctuations in the void. Dark energy is a cause of differentiation, thus acts in bigger orders of magnitude, as [[antigravity]]. Dark matter, is the second order gravity, among the gravitational orbits/paths and not directly the gravity of objects. Even potential paths exhibit inertia. Even particles (which are most of the time fields and not particles) are inertial flows of potentiality. The '''Universal void''' exhibits more unbiased randomness at the Planckian level than matter, but '''there is no void in the Universe'''. The '''Universal void''' is a phenomenon within our Universal topoalgebraic algorithm, thus it's not a '''void'''.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2A02:2149:8490:3400:608A:BDA2:6DF7:A815|2A02:2149:8490:3400:608A:BDA2:6DF7:A815]] ([[User talk:2A02:2149:8490:3400:608A:BDA2:6DF7:A815#top|talk]]) 11:07, 2 February 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Anomalies and discrepancies ==

Extra energetic photons: Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation gain twice as much energy as expected. This may indicate that gravity falls off faster than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.

== General Rewrite Suggestions for Accuracy, Brevity, and Clarity ==

Greetings fellow Wikipedians,

As a member of [[Wikipedia: WikiProject Science]] and a student editor with [[Wiki Education Foundation]], I have chosen to focus on reviewing and improving this article. When reviewing articles, my guiding objectives are to improve the "ABCs" of the article '''a'''ccuracy, '''b'''revity, and '''c'''larity. In this interest, the following suggestions are put forth:
<br>
:1. "On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars – and for the stars to group together into galaxies – so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe." (Introduction)
::''Proposed:'' "Earth's gravity gives weight to physical objects and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. Gravity is also responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe because it causes gaseous matter to coalesce into stars which then form solar systems and galaxies according to their gravity."
::''Reasoning:'' Improves clarity and brevity of content.
:2. Section 1.1 title: "Scientific Revolution" (Section 1.1)
::''Proposed:'' Section 1.1 title "Galileo"
::''Reasoning:'' All content in this section has to do directly with Galileo. The overall theme of the section is Galileo, not the Scientific Revolution.
:3. "Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of Galileo Galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries." (Section 1.1)
::''Proposed:'' "Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of Galileo Galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries during the period known as the Scientific Revolution."
::''Reasoning:'' If suggestion 2 is followed, this would improve the accuracy of this section.
:4. "Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets." (Section 1.2)
::''Proposed:'' "Newton's theory was used to predict the existence of Neptune based on observed motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets." 
::''Reasoning:'' Opinions such as "greatest success" should be avoided when stating facts.
:5. "The application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity." (Section 2.3)
::''Proposed:'' "Our knowledge of gravity has led to scientific breakthroughs concerning our Sun and planets in our Solar System, quasars, and even dark matter."
::''Reasoning:'' Improves brevity and accuracy by removing unsupported content. I challenge that these breakthroughs are the result of Newton's law of gravity specifically, and pose that these breakthroughs are more result of our general understanding of gravity including both Newtonian and Einsteinian contributions.
:6. "In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth." (Section 2.4)
::''Proposed:'' "In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves for the first time on 14 September 2015 as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth.

== Review of Sources and Citations ==

I have chosen to review this article's use of sources and citations in accordance with [[Wikipedia: Verifiability]]. The basis for my review is comprised of the following questions:
* Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference?
* Do the links work? Is there any close paraphrasing or plagiarism in the article?

Upon my review, I have noticed many instances in which citations are needed to verify facts. I will endeavor to edit these instances to reflect that citation is needed. Existing sources seem to be reliable and appropriate with the exception of a YouTube video which no longer exists and needs to be removed. Of the sources I explored, there appeared to be no plagiarism or close paraphrasing.

The whole Universe is a Feynman diagram. Empty space is virtual particles but they are connected with the standard baryonic matter. Gravity is a flow, a directional biasing towards someting; it is a direction of the birth and creation of the virtual particles. Baryonic matter is affected a. by the flow of the void, b. by losing time-flow energy, which becomes slower if the attracted object is small. <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2a02:2149:825f:3f00:15c4:2707:8443:1001|2a02:2149:825f:3f00:15c4:2707:8443:1001]] ([[User talk:2a02:2149:825f:3f00:15c4:2707:8443:1001#top|talk]]) 22:49, 20 September 2018‎ (UTC)</small>

::Actually as you go down into the Earth the acceleration of gravity decreases to zero at the center because, by [[Gauss's law]], at a subsurface point the gravitational force does not include the gravity of the spherical shell of matter outside that radius.  The further you go down, the smaller the sphere of matter inside the radius, so the less the gravitational force.  In a constant density planet the mass of the sphere of matter is proportional to R<sup>3</sup> but the inverse square force adds a factor of R<sup>-2</sup>, so below the surface the force, and acceleration of gravity, is proportional to R<sup>3</sup>/R<sup>2</sup> or R, and thus decreases linearly with radius, as the graph shows.  --[[User:Chetvorno|Chetvorno]]<sup><small>[[User talk:Chetvorno|<i style="color: Purple;">TALK</i>]]</small></sup> 17:51, 22 February 2019 (UTC)

:Note that even though the masses of the individual objects are important, the distance between them is a term that is squared, so that it has a much greater effect. For instance the sun is many thousands of times more massive than the moon, but because the moon is closer, its gravity causes larger tides in the ocean than the sun's gravity.

This is simply untrue.  I've just written [[:tidal force|tidal force]] which explains why the Moon affects the tides more than the Sun.

Is there anything useful to be gained by comparing the different terms in the equation?  I don't think so.  (After all, we wouldn't even be here if gravity were anything other than inverse square.)  I've removed this paragraph from the main article.

On another point, the derivation of g in this article invokes the principle of equivalence, which I guess should be an article in its own right... (I don't have time right now to start it, or the knowledge to complete it!)

My notes on M-theory, which come from statements made by physicists working in superstring theory, mention the gaps Einstein left behind are finally resolved. I do not understand much of this, but am happy that a "20 year old problem" has been removed, for the people who started all this with the formulations of string theory. Perhaps include a ref to M-theory with this data at the end of your article. It may update your credibility.

== Galileo legends ==

Did Galileo actually try dropping weights? My recollection is that he did an early, elegant thought experiment: he envisioned dropping two one-pound weights, each with a small chain atop it, simultaneously, and then linking the two chains and dropping the resulting paired weight. 

:I believe the weight dropping is legend, but he did experiment with inclined planes, where the effect can be demonstrated much easier. His thought experiment is not convincing though: it assumes that the force that an object feels does only depend on the object's mass and not on its shape. He forgot to state that assumption, and in fact the assumption is not justified in the presence of air resistance or in a non-homogeneous gravitational field (like the Earth's). --AxelBoldt

I don't recall if he physically dropped weights, but I am certain that he did pendulum experiments which are equivalent. His observation that the period of a pendulum only depends on it's length is equivalent to saying that falling objects accelerate at the same rate.

His inclined plane experiments may have been part of his observations, but their primary importance was in the idea of inertia. Galileo observed that when a ball rolled down an inclined plane and up a second, the ball will roll up the second plane until it has reached its original height, no matter the angle of the two planes. Galileo then imagined removing the second plane, and postulated that it would not stop since it would never re-achieve its original height. 

Also, Galileo's assumption that force due to gravity does not depend on shape was a damn good one. How would he know that? Simple, people have been using balances for millenia. Balances measure the relative force due to gravity. Showing that two objects  that have different shapes but the same mass experience the same gravitational force is trivial using a balance as long as their size is small compared to the radius of the Earth. The other nice thing about a balance is that it eliminates air resistance entirely.

You're point about Earth's gravitational field being non-homogenious is also false in a practical sense. IIRC, the variation to g (9.80665 m/s/s) is in the third decimal place as one travels over the surface of the Earth. Essentially, because the radius of the earth is so tremendous compared to human scales (on order of magnitude of thousands of kilometers IIRC) that treating the proportionality between mass and force due to gravity as a constant is perfectly fine for everyone but geophysicists. Essentially, all he needed to observe would be that traveling around he didn't change weight at all to prove that sufficiently for his purposes.

My whole point is that he didn't make these assumptions a priori, he made them based on experimental results. Whether or not people knew they were conducting experiments is another matter, but the results are the same.

== we *still* don't know; let's not pretend that we do ==

I didn’t change the article but note that Larson points out the fact that Newton did not assume action at a distance.  Indeed he says Newton called it 'absurd' and refused to commit himself to any specific explanation of gravity.  Maybe it would be more clear to say that 'Newton’s system ''necessarily'' involves the assumption of action at a distance.'   But there is another problem as well because the way it is worded gives the impression that Einstein provided the way out of the dilemma of having to assume action at a distance to explain gravity, but this is just not so.  He simply rearranged the problem.  Larson quotes G. C. McVitte: 'To say instead that gravitation is a manifestation of the curvature of four-dimensional geometrical manifolds is to account for a mystery by means of an enigma…' and also Bridgman: 'I believe, however, that an analysis of the operations that are used in specifying what the field is will show that the conceptual dilemma…has by no means been successfully met, but has merely been smothered in a mass of neglected operational detail.'  Larson sums up saying: 'As these observers indicate, what Einstein has actually accomplished, so far as the great dilemma of gravitation is concerned, is not to resolve it, but to push it farther into the background where its existence is less obvious.'  

The dilemma of the origin of Newton’s force has been hidden by GR is all. Now, instead of asking '1) How does Newton’s force originate?' and 2) 'How does it work?' we have to ask 1) 'How does the deformation originate; that is what is there about the property of mass that deforms space or space-time?' and 2) 'What is the mechanism of the deformation (How does it work)?' which of course, is the same dilemma. (See Larson’s Beyond Newton, pages 13-19) 

In view of these circumstances, I think the article could be revised considerably, not only to show the true status of gravitational theory, but also to eliminate the presentation of assumptions such as gravitational waves and black holes which are presented with the status of physical facts rather than the theoretical assumptions that they are.

== photons and gravity ==

I changed the line saying that a massless photon shouldn't be deflected in Newtonian gravity. On the basis that acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass you could argue that this is untrue, and on the other hand you could argue that it needs mass to respond to gravity. In essence this is a completely pointless argument because we can't get a massless particle in a Newtonian field to look at. I think it is much more revealing that Newtonian gravity still gets the answer wrong by a factor of two if you allow it to act on a photon.

== "gravity" vs "gravitation" vs "geodesy" ==

Just added a remark on gravity and gravitation being different things. Gravity is what makes you fall and includes the centrifugal (pseudo-) force.

I think it would actually be a good idea to separate the physics of the gravity field from the study of the Earth's gravity field -- the subject of physical geodesy.

== close but not exact ==

19 March 03. Someone should really edit the second paragraph after the subsection titled "History" that discusses how F=m*a together with Newton's law supposedly predicts Galileo's observation that unequal masses fall at the same rate.  Someone should correct this and point out that Newton's theory of gravity together with F=m*a actually predicts the general violation of Galileo's observation for most typical cases, and that Galileo's empirical law is only approximately correct in Newtonian theory (to very high accuracy albeit) due to the unequal mutual attraction exerted between the Earth (fixed mass) and either of two unequal masses, that results in unequal rates of acceleration or fall (again the effect is very very closely the same as Galileo's result due to the huge diffrence in mass in most cases of practical importance for objects on or near Earth, or even for large satellites).  But whatever the case, however tiny the effect, the reader should not be left with the impression that Newton's theory confirms Galileo to 100% precision!  The bit where the acceleration of a mass is given as: a_1=G*m_2/r^2 should thus be qualified by noting that, a_2=G*m_1/r^2 (the acceleration of the Earth towards the mass m_1 that should be added vectorially to get the mutual falling rate) is insignificant in comparison with a_1, and so Galileo's rule holds approximately for all practical purposes, though not exactly theoretically.

In other words, one could say on the contrary to the current Wikipedia article, that Aristotle was techically correct in the absurd sense, i.e. in an ironic twisted sort of way only when one subtracts all the fallacious reasoning that Aristotle came up with!

-B. Smith

:Well, to be fair, even to that degree of precision, Galileo's claim would still hold, since he was dropping two objects of different weight (mass) '''at the same time'''. So, the Earth's acceleration would be the sum of the acceleration caused by the two objects, but not different for the two objects. And both those objects would be accelerated at exactly the same rate. So, you'd get exactly the same measured acceleration no matter how many decimal places, as long as you dropped them both at the same time. ;-) -- [[User:JohnOwens|JohnOwens]] 00:54 Mar 26, 2003 (UTC)

== dark energy ==

Removed this

::Interestingly, recent experiments are leading many physicists to the conclusion that there is another force in the universe, a repulsive force, that opposes gravity.  Currently dubbed Dark Energy, the source of this force is also a mystery to science, but it may be connected to the same phenomenon responsible for the gravitational force.  If so, Sir Isaac's insight into the nature of the problem may yet prove prophetic, and his reservations prudent. His desire was to be able to circumscribe physics into one great whole by what he called 'reasoning from mechanical principles.'

There's no particular reason to think that dark energy has anything at all to do with gravity.

:Or that there is such a thing as "dark energy". 

:IMHO the "dark energy" is only an attempt to modify ''Einstein's Equation'' by making the ''cosmological constant'' a part of the ''source'' in order to fix another lame modification of Einstein's theory that demanded zero cosmological constant (to fix "Einstein's greatest blunder") and so it predicted a ''decelerating expansion''. After this prediction turned out to be wrong (and Einstein not as inept as assumed), the failure had to be blamed on something that was not possible to guess rather than on poor understanding of Einsteinian physics. But since Einsteinian physics works quite well then due to Occam's razor we may safely forget the "dark energy". [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 16:23, 2004 Jun 27 (UTC)

== EM v. gravity ==

The subparagraph concerning the relative strengths of EM and gravity substitutes unfounded theory for tested fact.  It is stated that one or both masses must be neutral to a very high degree, but there is no confirmation of this.  In fact there is a huge amount of common sense data that conflicts with it.  It is highly unlikely the all the gravitating masses we know of could be EM neutral to the degree stated.  It is felt that they must be, to make QED's current conception of gravity consistent, but no one has ever measured the overall electromagnetism of the earth, as a discrete body.  Likewise, the statement that a simple magnet overwhelms gravity is only one explanation of the phenomenon, an explanation that has no data to back it up.  The truth, as admitted earlier in the article, is that no one, not Newton, not Einstein, and not current theorists, know what causes gravity.  All the analyses, no matter how mathematically complex, are very short on basic concepts.  It is not even known that gravity is in fact a field.  The graviton is just an hypothesis at this point.  No scientist should pretend to understand a phenomenon he or she does not understand.  The magnet sentence, as well as the EM neutral sentence should be saved for much later, lest they end up making the writer look foolish.

== Is it ''g'', ''gee'', ''g''<sub>e</sub>, ''g''<sub>0</sub>, or what ? ==

In the [[specific impulse]] and [[gravity]] articles
"the acceleration at Earth's surface (9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)."

But it's still inconsistent with the [[gravity]] article.

Is there some reason to pick one over the other ?
I hear it pronounced like ''"gee"'' ("most people black out in a 11-gee acceleration"), but how is that spelled ?

:Well, I would recommend a lone ''g'', and put in a qualification to say that acceleration at the Earth's surface is intended in this context. I'd make it an italic ''g'', too, since physical constants are typically italics. That distinguishes it from g (grams), but it's a pretty weak distinction.

== Is this really a problem with Newtonian gravity ? ==

The article currently says

: 5. Under Newtonian gravity (with instantaneous transmission of gravitational force), if the universe is Euclidean, static, infinite, and of uniform, average, positive density, then the total gravitational force on a point is a divergent series. In other words, newtonian gravity is inconsistent with a universe which is Euclidean, static, infinite, and of uniform, average, positive density.

I fail to see why this is a "problem". All kinds of other bizzare things happen in a infinite, uniform universe (for example, [[Olbers' paradox]]). I've been told that even Einstein's general theory of relativity can't handle an infinite, uniform universe either.

== the acceleration due to gravity ==

Is ''"the acceleration due to gravity"'' really a helpful concept, or is it just confusing ?
Raindrops and parachutists are clearly pulled to the ground by gravity, but over most of the fall, their acceleration is zero.
-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:49, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)

See
[[WikiBooks:Gravity (Physics Study Guide)]]

----

In the case of raindrops and parachutists, the acceleration due to gravity is still present, but at a certain point, the air resistance pushing against the fall becomes great enough to stop any further acceleration - this is what we call terminal velocity. --[[User:Darkstone|Darkstone]] 19:55, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Yes, that's true.
Some textbooks say that ''"the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2"''. Is that a good thing to say, or will it be less confusing if we emphasize that gravity is a force, not an acceleration ? Raindrops *never* accelerate at 9.81 m/s^2.
-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:42, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Gravity is a force, not an acceleration: "the acceleration '''due''' to gravity", there's a distinction. Raindrops don't accelerate at that speed, and I'm willing to bet that parachutists don't either, because of air resistance. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth would only be 9.81ms^-2 if one was falling through a vacuum

== Rename law of universal grav to Newtons... ==

The section "law of universal graviation" needs renaming (I have) to "newtons law of..." to emphasise that this is the old theory. Its not true under GR, of course.

:I think it's largely fine. "Newtons" needs to be "Newton's" - I think I've changed all of those. I'm also changing the bit about very dense objects - because the field is then only strong very close to such an object (unless it's already massive).

:: OK so far (WMC)

::: Hello. If I may jump in -- perhaps giving each theory the most descriptive name will be most felicitous. Naming theories after people is slightly problematic in that it doesn't tell anything about the content of the theory, and sometimes introduces irrelevant controversies about credit and precedence. Can we say ''relativistic theory'' instead of ''Einstein's theory''? I'd prefer ''classical'' to ''Newtonian'' or ''Newton's'' too, although I must admit "classical" is not very descriptive. Comments? -- [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 02:36, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:::: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 09:14, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)) I renamed it because the previous title - universal law or whatever - was quite misleading (for the N section). classical graviation is a possibility, but I would prefer N's, because: *everyone* knows its N's law of gravitation. If you called it classical, many would mistake that for pre-N laws (ok, they would be swiftly corrected when they read it). As for the GR version: again, I would say E's name should be there. Perhaps "E's GR theory of G"?

==Theories of gravity in chronological order==

WMC is right. People's names are much better to identify theories since they prevent ambiguity. E.g. "classical" may be presently understood as ''Einstein's general relativity'', a physical theory of gravitation based on curvatures of spacetime, not necessarily adopting any particular metric. Unlike ''standard model'' general relativity that is based on particular form of ''Einstein's Equation'' and on FRW metric as its solution, a particular mathematical theory, which also, unlike ''Einstein's universe'', includes expanding space. 

:We have in chronological order: 
#'''Newtonian gravitation''' characterised by its ''fundamental force of universal gravitational attraction'' if not necessarily invented by Newton then by someone who couldn't imagine anything else
#since 1915, '''Einstein's general relativity''' with the fundamental gravitational attractive force replaced by ''pseudoforce'' and cosmological constant fitting "static" universe since it [[Hubble redshift]] hasn't been discovered yet
#since 1929 ''standard general relativity'' without cosmological constant (named then "Einstein's biggest blunder") and with FRW metric predicting expanding universe with expansion slowing down due to the "attractive gravitational force" (mysteriously recovered) since Hubble redshift has been discovered by [[Edwin Hubble]] and soon after for lack of any sensible ideas why the universe would look expanding nut really wasn't it was declared that the universe must be really expanding, an idea lasting till today ([[2004]])
#since 1998, the present general relativity (non standard yet, since cosmologists are not sure any more) with restored cosmological constant in form of ''dark energy'' represetning now a "repulsive force" (presumably fundamental too, "overcoming" the mysteriously recoverd attractive force) and very unpleasant accelerating expansion of the universe (unfortunately observed by astronomers to the great dismay of cosmologists)
#nonexistent yet "quantum gravity" that everybody and his brother is talking about but makes no sense as Einstein's type theory since it is supposed to restore the "fundamental force of gravity", this time "repulsive", in form of action of "gravitons" so nobody needs to learn general relativity any more (in which I see certain cultural regress and a possible return of the new middle ages but I hope I'm wrong).

Actually we should know if we read "The Universal Theory Of Pressure" by Zony Said. The thesis proved that gravity is actually caused by pressure and not by mass.

When I read this discourse on gravity, it seems to me this is all a presentation of our observations and measurements of gravity, its effects and so on, but it leaves me unfulfilled.

Is there any way to tell readers exactly What Is Gravity?

What is it?  We have explanations for photons, for waves, for whatever phenomenom.  But why isn't there an explanation for what gravity really IS.

Maybe it's like magnetism.  We don't know yet what it is.

I think it's better to change its concept rather than its name.

Hello, I was thinking... You know how the religious folks say that evolution is "just a theory"? Even though they have theory and hypothesis confused, I'd like to indirectly help them understand that evolution is one of, if not the, strongest theory in science. I tend to say to religous folks "we also have the theory of gravity, and the theory of the atom, both of which are quite incomplete compared to the theory of evolution". I may be wrong with this statement, since i'm not a scientist.

::Hi William, did you have a good time? Where have you been? [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

So: I've stripped more stuff from the intro. Which will undoubtedly annoy Some People so I'll try to justify this:

* ''Later developments have shown that this force does not actually exist.'' This can't really be justified. What anyway is a "force"? Don't forget, GR is not the end of gravity theory, its just another and better model (actually for all we know it may be the end but I don't think thats generally believed, what with QM and all)

::Whatever is ''believed'', this first sentence that you deleted presents the present state of the theory and we can't put here what we believe there should be according to our understanding of physics but what we ''know'' that there is in the theory that we describe. We are to inform readers and not to push our own ideas. Whoever wrote the sentence that you deleted (it was not me BTW) he/she expressed the truth about GR. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 

* ''Newton's formulas with their simple math are sufficiently accurate. For example, rocket ships, bullets, and peregrine falcons do not attain the high speeds nor involve the immense masses which necessitate the use of Einstein's math.''. I don't like "simple math" in this contexts since it suggests "simplistic". "high speed" is wrong, I think. Speed makes no difference that SR doesn't cover. "immense masses" is also wrong: its the concentration of the mass. After all, black holes are no more massive than the starts which made them. 

::The same thing. The author (I believe the same) expressed very well why Newtonian stuff is OK (he/she was correcting my stuff and did it well). It is "simple" and surely not "simplistic". "High speed" ''makes'' difference for Newtonian gravity, the same as "strong field". But "immense mass" make very good sortcut because the explanation of "strong field" that involves curvature of space has to be put for later. Surely can't be explained at the beginning. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

* ''We present the description of gravitation starting with Newtonian math. It isn't physics, but it is simple and helpful for learning the [[quantitative]] part of the physics of gravitation. Then we proceed to Einstein's model to explain the true, as we believe now, and even simpler physics. It is simpler since there is no mysterious "gravitational attraction" in it that would require an explantion. We skip the exact math that is not very useful even for professonals and is generally considered the most difficult math that has ever existed in physics (Einstein once said about his theory something like "if you think that you have problems with math I may assure you they are nothing compared to mine".).'' This isn't OK. You mean, it is no longer the currently accepted best-theory and has problems with action-at-a-distance. But that doesn't disqualify it from being physics. GR is very attractive but, I think, is properly regarded as a better model rather than true. "simpler" is a slippery concept. You and I are skipping the exact math for the excellent reason that neither of us understand it in detail. Suggesting that its not useflu for proffs is weird.

::(This is my part). There can be only one physics, and if there is a "better one" all others are disqualified since only one can be '''true'''. Science is not like political theories. It is either true or not. If you don't like GR, too bad, but for the time being we can't prove it is wrong. We have to tell that it explains everything if it does, and we can't say "Oh yeah, it explain everything all right but we don't believe it anyway and actually we prefer the old theory, or we just wait for quantum gravity". You may express such an opinion privately only, because Wikipedia is here to inform people of what is there and not that we have better ideas. 

::I agree that "simpler" is the matter of opinion. It is simpler for me but it may be not simpler for you. "Objectively" it is simpler because it uses less assumptions and more facts that Newton didn't even know about. But if you don't like "simpler" let's dump it. 

::It is really not usefull for proffs. There are no exact solutions for any practical problem and Newtonian math has to be used all over the place, even if its physics is wrong. But it is irrelevant. Introduction to GR's math is about 1000 pages long. We can't even start producing the GR's math, we just have to explain the (simpler than Newtonian) physics.

* ''When we see Einstein's physics we might understand why Newton's math based on "gravitational attraction" is accurate despite that masses in the universe don't attract each other.'' This actually skates round something the article doesn't mention - that GR has the newtonian limit built into it. GR *doesn't* (in my admittedly limited understanding) derive the laws ex nihilio. The basic equations come from the equiv prin but to actually get gravity you need to be aiming at something that looks like N's formulae. I'll try to dig out a ref to prove this. 

::This is what I'm doing there: I'm showing how the most relavant part of GR is ''identical'' to Newtonian math. The same equation different physics. I also show that whatever you may think about, Einstein's theory explains that too. What else do you need to show? And where did you get the idea about the "basic equation coming from the equivalence principle"? The basic equation is  Einstein's field equation, that has very long way to this principle, which is just (simple) physics with very little value in proving anything. It is just another illustration that Einstein's physics explains whatever there is to be explained.

==Mass equivalence==

I find this puzzling: The sentence
"General relativity also explains the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass, which has to be assumed in Newtonian theory."
is tucked away in the "Experimental" section of this article. Why? This a '''very''' important difference between Newton and GR and should be prominently displayed, even more so than the Mercury orbit precession, because it is a "qualitative" difference of the theories and '''testable''' for GR. [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 18:06, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:I explained in the end of section "Why Einsteins' gravity differs from Newton's" why quantitative differences are decisive and qualitative diffs are only a nice addition. It is an illustration of the old truth that only agreement with observation can deliver knowledge. It is because human logic can be too easily abused to be a reliable device in science (with a possible exception of math, but math without physics behind it is useless anyway). [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 09:25, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I completly disagree! Let's say theory A and B are said to explain why an experimenter measures the number 2.5 +- 0.01. This is a quantative check of both theories. But for something complex like real life, all theories must make decisions, what input to use to calculate the expected result, plus the systematic errors of the experiment (bias). For example the Mercury orbit precession: Do I try to add a not yet discovered planet (Vulcan) to explain its value or not? Does alpha Centauri have any influence or not?
In contrast, if the foundation of theory B says that the number is fixed to 2.0, than there is no way to wiggle out of the conclusion that B is incorrect! That is a "quality" of theory B and can not be "tuned." Therefore I think that the equivalence principle in GR is one of the most important aspects, being a qualitative consequence of the geometric basis of the theory! I do not mean to say that "qualitative" means unmeasurable!! [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 11:58, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:You're right but I meant different kind of importance. Not a quality of a theory as a piece of art but simply whether we can trust the theory because the result it predicts are as observed (regardless of how the theory gets them). Of course if there is no flexibility in the way of predicting the results it is a "better" theory. However first of all it can't be a false theory since then no amount of beauty will save it. So testing predictions is always the first step and in this sense it is more important. Only then we analyze the means of achieving those results (and sometimes have to suffer in silence).

:Whatever Einstein's gravity predicts is achieved without any possibility of adjustments, which makes it a great theory, and maybe we should expose this fact. In my opinion it is because Einstein's theory is simply a true theory and so all the results have to come out necessarily true. But I think that very few people really appreciate this kind of beauty that you are talking about and the only thing that counts for them are "hard data". Especially in gravity physics which is too close to cosmology with its endless ad hoc adjustments any time a new discovery turns the old stuff upside down. 

:Please note that in cosmology the leading scientists already abandoned even the principle of conservation of energy to be able to explain the observed results, while Einstein's theory requires only to abandon the idea of expansion. Yet it would be too tough on many leading scientists so we keep adding new epicycles and so our "hard data" still "confirm the theory". A theory without conservation of energy, with superluminal "speed of expansion" when it's needed to keep the theory alive, and now with unknown yet new forms of matter ("dark") and energy (also "dark") that is not even included in T<sub>&mu;&nu;</sub> tensor of Einstein's equation but mysteriously in &Lambda; that suddenly became a "repulsive gravity" (in a supposedly Einsteinian type of theory in which there is not even "attractive" gravity!). 

:However who cares if nothing else in it makes much sense anyway. Just let's see what other physics we have to give up to keep the expansion. Enjoy the spectacle while it lasts. Suddenly someone with access to a scientific journal may notice that Einstein's gravity doesn't need all that ... and it might end overnight as if it never happened. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 14:16, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:BTW, in section "Why do we see an accelerating expansion of the universe?" I'm trying to explain why Einstein's gravity doesn't need all that ... I'd appreciate your opinion about it. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 14:37, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I'm sorry, but I was under the impression we are trying to create a good encyclopedic page about Gravity, and have some information about its current explanation by science. Even though you're points are interesting and might lead to some entertaining discussion, how does what you say change the structure of this page? We should '''not''' do the work of the scientists trying to figure out how it works, but summarize what they have done so far, and if further work is being done. So, saying things like 'GR is true' is not helpful, since nobody knows that. It is an assumption, right? So, back to my point: I would suggest to add the "equivalence of masses" as an important quality of GR to a fitting section at the beginning, explaining that this follows from the geometry approach of its base equations and concepts. That's all I ask. Anything wrong with that? [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 16:47, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Of course it is an assumption. What else one can have in science? But IMHO for the time being this asumption can't be falsified so we better treat it seriously. We don't need to try to figure out how it works since Einstein already did it for us, we just need to report it. And as for adding the "equivalence of masses" go ahead and add it. Then we see how it looks and if good then it stays. But there are people here who seem offended by suggestions that Newtonian stuff might be wrong. So they may remove it as they keep removing my messages that there is no universal gravitaional attraction in contemporary physics what Einsteinian stuff says and I'm just reporting it according to what is presently thought about the gravitation.

==Creating a good encyclopedic page about Gravity==

In "trying to create a good encyclopedic page about Gravity," special attention should be paid to the opening paragraphs.  Currently, they read as follows:

:''Gravitation is the tendency of masses to move toward each other.''

:''The first mathematical formulation of the theory of gravitation was made by Isaac Newton and proved astonishingly accurate. He postulated the force of "universal gravitational attraction".''

:''Newton's theory has now been replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of General relativity in which there is no such force as "gravitational attraction" ("universal" or otherwise) but for most purposes dealing with weak gravitational fields (for example, sending rockets to the moon or around the solar system) Newton's formulae are sufficiently accurate. For this reason Newtons law is often used and will be presented first.''

First of all, Newton did not formulate a "theory of gravitation."

:Someone had to and called it "Newton's theory of gravitation" because it is in the history of science. Is it known who did it? It's an important piece of info for a good page on gravitation. But it probably has to go to the page on history of science with a link in "Gravity" page. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

Second, he didn't postulate a "force of universal gravitational attraction."  

:Someone had to and called it "Newton's force of universal gravitational attraction" because it is in the history of science as well. A doubt that it is known who's done it but link to history page should be sufficient. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

He formulated a mathematical law that described the observed universal attraction of matter.  I know that this may seem nitpicky to some, but it's important to be accurate, especially in light of the fact that Newton stated that he refused to form a hypothesis (theory) concerning gravity, and indeed explained why he refused to do so.  

: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 08:31, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) I don't believe any of that, but I'll check in his papers when I get home. AFAIK Newton thought he was describing an universal law. The "no hypotheses" stuff is oft misquoted - all he meant was that he didn't like action at a distance.

: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 21:38, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) OK, I am at home and do have my copy of principia with me (actually Hawkings collection "on the shoulders of giants"). Newton says (defn V and after): ''A centripetal force is... Of this sort is gravity, by which bodies are drawn to the centre of the earth magnestism, by which iron tends to the loadstone; and that force, whatever it is, by which the planets are perpetually drawn aside...''.

Then, in the Einstein section, the text of the article reads as follows:

:''Newton's formulation of gravity is quite accurate for most practical purposes. There are a few problems with it though:

:*''It assumes that changes in the gravitational force are transmitted instantaneously when positions of gravitating bodies change. However, this contradicts the fact that there exists a maximum velocity at which signals can be transmitted (speed of light in vacuum).'' 
:*''Assumption of absolute space and time contradicts Einstein's theory of special relativity.'' 
:*''It does not explain the small portion of precession of orbit of Mercury of order of one angular second per century that kept astronomers baffled for more then a century as to the reason for it.'' 
:*''It predicts that light is deflected by gravity only half as much as observed.''

Again, Newton's formulation was a mathematical expression of the force of gravity, not a formulation of (a theory of) gravity.  So, this would read better if it read: "Newton's formulation of the law of gravity..."  However, in the list of four problems that follows, there is more trouble.  First, "it," that is, Newton's Law of Universal Gravity, doesn't "assume" that "changes in the gravitational force are transmitted instantaneously," this is an observed fact.  

:You ''assume'' that it is a fact, don't you? [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

:: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 08:31, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) I agree with Jim, only more vehmenently (especially if I could spell it...): your so-called observed fact is nonsense. Nothing goes faster than light (or at least, nothing (carrying information) has ever been observed to, and it would destroy SR if it did).

Second, this observation doesn't "contradict the fact that there exists a maximum velocity at which signals can be transmitted (speed of light in vacuum);" The contradiction is with the ''assumption'' that gravity must operate through a transmission process that is so limited.  

: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 08:31, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) I think you're either in pet-theory territory or totally confused.

:I think it would be considered ''original research'' if we did it this way. We have to stick closer to what is ''known''. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

We need to keep the facts straight so as not to be misleading if at all possible.

:That's a good idea. But IMHO the "facts" which existence we ''assume'' are at least a little misleading in view of present theory of gravitation (''Einstein's''). [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 06:37, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

The second "problem," having to do with Newton's assumption of absolute space and time, does not pertain to his law of gravity specifically, and therefore to say that it contradicts "Einstein's theory of special relativity," and for this reason is a problem as a law of gravity is nonsense in this context.  It doesn't make any sense because the fact that Einstein assumed relative values of space and time in order to explain the observed behavior of light is unrelated to law of gravity.  This issue is only relevant to Einstein's ''theory'' of gravity, not to Newton's formulation of the law of gravity.

Likewise, the third and fourth "problems" could be stated better in order to reflect the true situation.  The third one should simply state that Newton's law fails to correctly account for the gravitational force between bodies moving at relatively high speeds such as in the case of the planet mercury's high-speed orbit around the sun.  The fourth one should state that it fails to correctly account for the effect of mass on the propagation of radiation, which of course was never contemplated in Newton's day.

Changing these paragraphs will necessitate a minor change in the text of the paragraph that follows them, but otherwise presents no real obstacle and would improve the accuracy of the article considerably in my opinion. [[User:Dbundy|Doug]] 21:11, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 08:31, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) Fair enough. I'm very reluctant to trust you because of all that stuff about particles "wanting to" move around. And if you are trying to explain this to 15-y-olds, if I don't understand (never mind agree) with it, its pretty unlikely that 15-y-o's will. We shall see.

::::The story about particles "wanting" move around gets a little bit into quantum mechanics (or perheps rather deeply but we, the intrepid discoverers of mysteries of the universe, don't mind).    

::::As you may recall, the basic thing in quantum mechanics is ''probability'' that a particle is somewhere. Now each particle has its "wave function" that for our porpose is just "probability wave" with certain strange properties, which we don't need to get into because quantum physicists take care of them (and don't understand them neither, which is irrelevant here). We just need to know that those "probability waves" interfere either constructively or destructively with each other. Now, you can take it on faith (to save me long derivation) that when a paths along which the time has an extremum (either minimium or maximum) then all those waves add constructively otherwise the summation is destructive and results in ''zero''. The same thing goes for "light waves" by the way, and so light moves only along paths with extremal time. If you remember this from physics it makes my lecture more credible and saves me derivation (simple derivation but tedious so why to bother if you believe me). So if those "waves of probability" add destructively (and so the probability of finding a particle on a "destructive path" is zero), quantum mechanics says: particle can't be there. And it just happens, for the form of the Newtonian math that is the same as Einsteinian math for "time dilation", that proper time along Newtonian orbits has a maximum. So all those "probability waves" add constructively only there. So one can find particles ''only there''. Only on Newtonian orbits, without any "force" placing the particles on those orbits.    

::::So we are justified saying that they just "want" to be there "by themselves". It's of course realy not their "free will" but laws of quantum mechanics, but the final result is exactly the same, so we may advise 15 y. o. that those particles just want to be only there. When they got interested ''why'' it happens, and start reading quantum mechanics stuff to figure it out, we don't need to worry any more because they'll learn pretty soon by themselves. And when their curiosity gets awaken maybe they find out also something that we don't know yet. Which would be a very good use of wikipedia. 

::::Of course those Newtonian orbits are, because of extremal time, also geodesics in spacetime. But for 15 y.o. it might be safer to explain everything in 3D flat space only with which they may be more comfortable than with 4D curved spacetime. Besides it is a straightforward physics, even if quantum, rather than mysterious ''geometry in curved 4D spacetime'' that for some people may be too mysterious to comprehend it (even if it is exactly the same thing). The advantage of physical explanation over mathematical.

::::Is the explanation sufficient or you have more questions why those particles take Newtonian orbits without any force holding them on those orbits? Of course with "strong fields" the picture is a little bit distorted by "curvature of space" but I hope you expected it anyway. So the exact math (with both, time dilation, and curvature of space, or as we rather say with ''curvatures of spacetime'') is rather complicated but we want only to have an idea how is it possible that something happens without a force forcing it to happen. And possibly what was Einstein thinking about when he proposed his theory of curvatures of spacetime replacing "gravitatinal attraction". [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 17:23, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Faster than Speed of Light? ==

Can anybody tell me their opinions on these:
* [http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992796] ''While the peak moves faster than light speed, the total energy of the pulse does not. This means Einstein's relativity is preserved''
* [http://www.ldolphin.org/vanFlandern/] Probably junk
* [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/faster_than_c_000719.html] ''"This is anything but dramatic," said Happer. "If you look at the data, there’s essentially no evidence that [the beam] is going faster than the speed of light." ... What’s more, most scientists agree that even if such a beam can be proved speedier than light, it would probably not be able to carry any information.''
* [http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/gravity/speed_limit.asp] Same chap as #2

So...what is the speed of gravity?

:According to Einstein's theory (of gravitation) the "speed of gravity" is c (the same as speed of light). 

:: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 16:57, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) Agreed.

: There is an effect of "apparent speed", which is not really an effect of ''speed'' but an effect of ''dirction'' from which the ''interaction'' comes that is a little bit tilted forward, pointing almost exactly toward the place where the actual position of the object that causes this interaction is, and that's why it looks like the ''interaction'' comes "''instantly''". Because it comes from the ''direction'' of actual position of the object and not from the ''retarded position'' as non physicists might expect it to come from. It is a well known effect in physics, especially in electromagnetism, and so real physicists simply ignore such problems. However those problems excite amateur astronomers (and even some professional astronomers who didn't have enough training in physics) a lot causing endless discussions. If you are interested in details of physics of this effect the subject to study is ''Linard-Wiechert potential'' or some variation of it.

:: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 16:57, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)) I think I know what you mean here but it isn't really about the speed of gravity in particular.

:As for "super luminal speed of light" it is easy see how it can be simulated: If you set a long row of people and tell each of them to raise a hand at certain specific time, an observer might see a ''wave'' of raising hands moving through this row with certain speed. This speed may be faster than light, but it is only a "wave moving" not any physical object moving, just a visual impression (what waves really are; we tend forgetting that in "wave motion" no substance really changes permanently position it just oscillates). So ''waves'', also light ''waves'' (but only ''waves'', not photons) can move with any speed imaginable because it is not a physical speed that is limited by relativity to c (in flat space, to be exact).

==Why Einsteins' gravity differs from Newton's - Last paragraph==
Some more issues with this article: The last paragraph of this particular section talks about the "cosmological constant" introduced by Einstein, I presume? If yes, than it is not correct (besides its also questionable style). The constant was not dropped because of "beauty," but because it was introduced by Einstein to accomodate the (then) held view of a static cosmos. That forced him to introduce a (mathematically natural) constant '''and''' at the same time '''choosing its value''' to counteract the attractive forces of the total mass in the cosmos, which by itself forces change to its curvature over time. 

:Einstein's theory is based on lack of "attractive force" so the above is not quite exact: the theory doesn't need to counteract something that the theory sais doesn't exist. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

::I'm rather surprised you say that. I have the text book in front of me, which I used to study GR (by ''H. Stephani'') and it shows the "Einstein Universe" created in 1917 by Einstein as a solution to the GR equation for the cosmos. It is a specific setup of a "Friedman Cosmology," where all parts in the equation want to change the "curvature" of the cosmos in the '''same''' direction. I used the word "force" to describe its general effect on the Universe, even though the equation does not have the correct units for it, I admit. Even so, "Lambda" was explicitly added to have all such effects cancelled and make the Universe static and stable. Do you dispute that? [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 11:05, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Now I'm surprised that you are surprised. "Force" is measured in kgm/s/s (or N for short). If it is in other units that don't reduce to N it is not "force". If you call "force" something that is not force while you are talking about physics at least you have to mention what it is. 

:Of course I don't dispute that "&Lambda; was explicitly added to have all such effects cancelled and make the Universe static and stable". It was more than 20 years before anybody suspected that the universe may expand or contract (even now some doubt) so most people in Einstein's shoes would do it. What's strange about it? If you have a solution that is non physical in your opinion you set parameters in your equation in such way that the solution makes sense physically, which Einstein did according to his understanding of physics of the universe. Farthermore the value of &Lambda; doesn't introduce any "force" since this variable only determines the evolution of geometry (if it has different than "Einstein's value", regardless of the fact that wordlines of the particles take geodesics in spacetime and therefore are imune to any forces). The burden of explaining why the universe is physically expanding without any force forcing it to do so (only with Freidman solutions showing that it is) is on you if you think that the universe is physically expanding. Einstein set &Lambda; so that it doesn't show the expansion, so he is sitting pretty with nothing to prove (except possibly that his universe should show accelerating Hubble redshift but it is in his theory already if you look closely, as I tried to show in the last section). [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

Einstein itself called it a "blunder," because he could have predicted that "Lambda" could be different than '''that''' value, and with it the expansion or contraction of the universe. This is important history, which predates discussions about the (second order) change of the speed of the curvature change, as it is now brought about by observation! This should not be mingled, IMO. I agree that setting it to zero and adjusting all other values to match observation was a particular choice, but it was done more because of the unknown physical meaning of "Lambda" than for any other reason, I believe. 

:The ''physical reason'' was known and it was of course ''lack of expansion'' assumed by Einstein. Whether it is a ''true physical reason'' is still the matter of debate among physicists. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

::I don't get it. Parts of this article describe the history of the theory of Gravity, so this '''is''' an important item to describe correctly. What does any "not yet known ''true reason''" have to do with that? I wonder if there is a problem with the general approach to NPOV in the current form of this article... [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 11:05, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC) 

:The problem that you missed somehow is that what you call "the (second order) change of the speed of the curvature change" has thrown a monkey wrench into cosmology. We don't know (surely I don't know), neither any astrophysicist knows (because none is volunteering any opinion), what is the true state of the universe. I've been attending seminars in cosmology for whole 2003/2004 academic year and it turns out that it is not known what is the true theory of gravity. Most people wait for quatum gravity. We have Einstein's theory, which we know exactly, and that so far didn't contradict any observations. Neither it explain existence of any "repulsive force" though, which some physicsists postulate to explain accelerating expansion ("dark energy" if it rings any bells). That's why quantum gravity got so promissing. But apparently no one knows how to reinstate the Newtonian "gravitational force" so that it would act as attractive force in one instance and as repulsive force in another (or work at all). And also to predict all things that Einstein's theory predicts, not to mention geodesic motion. That's the situation. So the best thing we can do is just to report all that we know and see if someone is able to make some sense out of it. Do you have a better idea? [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 17:50, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::Okay, I think I understand where you are coming from.
::I'm not sure about a "better idea", but I agree we should report what "we know," ie. what current science sees as our best theory matching (even if just barely) the observations. However, my "pet gripe" with some articles is that they have too much info crammed into one big page. I would like to see this article slightly changed, where the details of the theories have their own respective pages, and in here we have summaries of the theories of "Gravity" in their historic succession. This must include pre-Newtonian, Newtonian and GR theories.

=== Rewrite the Article ===

In my opinion, the three subheadings "How Curvatures...", "Why Einstein's Gravity...", and "Why Do We See..." are out of scope for this article.  Any in-depth discussion of GRT/SRT vs Newtonian concepts are not discussions of gravity, but discussions of theories.  It would be better to stick to the facts of what gravity does, how it behaves, and what the experiments show, instead of getting into the theoretical concepts that can only lead to confusion here and POV disputes because they cannot possibly be clarified sufficiently within the scope of the article.  Just state the the most basic facts:

*Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation requires "action at a distance."
*Einstein's GRT does not, but introduces a non-Euclidian reference system to escape it, which requires finite transmission of gravitational waves.

The gravitational issue is instaneous action vs non-instantaneous action.  We shouldn't even get into the more esoteric theoretical aspects.  These issues can be clarified in the articles on SRT, GRT, Newton's Law, Inertia, Speed of Light, Cosmology, etc.

Actually, the article could be written to disabuse the all too common perception that Einstein's theory was formulated to replace Newton's Law.  This is not correct.  The Michaelson - Morley experiment demolished the validity of the universal aspect of Newton's laws of motion.  Their experiment produced a direct conflict between the observation of the constancy of the velocity of light and Newton's concept of motion.  Obviously, something had to give and the issue was what should it be.  The concept of sacrificing absolute magnitudes of space, time and motion started with Fitzgerald, continued with Lorentz, and culminated with Einstein, but this development lasted nearly a decade of excruciating embarassment because there seemed to be no answer to the problem.  

Einstein's theories came to be accepted in spite of serious weaknesses due in large part to the fact that there was no viable alternative and the scientific community was desperate for a solution after so many years without a clue.  However, the theoretical approach's vehement critics lost the battle because "you can't beat something with nothing."  Nevertheless, that doesn't mean that some alternative other than the sacrifice of absolute magnitudes and Euclidian geometry won't be found eventually.  In the meantime, we should strive to keep the facts straight and the issues clear, and not confuse the real issues of motion and force with issues of theoretical concepts such as choice of reference systems, assumptions of the nature of space and time, and political issues of "normal" science.
[[User:Dbundy|Doug]] 15:31, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:You might be right that we should limit ourselves to the math of gravity and whether it is based on "instaneous action vs non-instantaneous action". The problem though is that it wouldn't explain to readers "why things fall?" an answer to which they might be looking for in an article on gravity. For an article about gravity it would be probably even worse than venturing a little bit into various ideas responding to "why things fall?" Which is just a theory that you want to avoid discussing. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 17:50, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::This is funny.  You just made my point: WE DON'T KNOW WHY THINGS FALL!  We have some theories, but those are best explained in their own articles.  The only thing we know for sure is that things fall (move) inwards towards one another in proportion to their mass and in inverse proportion to their distance from each other.  We also know that relative motion between them somehow affects the rate of their fall if it's magnitude is great enough.  We also know that whatever causes the gravitational motion cannot be screened off nor modified in any way not involving mass.

::We do not know if space-time is a 4D metric that can be curved or warped or cause matter to follow a certain path.  We do not know if time "dialates," if length "contracts," or if one mass instantly attracts another or not.  These concepts belong to abstract ideas - speculations, hypotheses - proferred to explain how gravity operates, but they are not facts or laws.  We should make this clear.

:::It's not ''that'' bad. We know that time gets dilated and how much (we don't know why). The time dilation has been measured. The same about curvature of space (gravitational lensing is an obvious astronomical observation). We know how much space has to be curved if time is dilated and energy is conserved. So ''we know'' that nothing in Einstein's theory is contradicted by observations. A lot of it is confirmed by measurments. What is not agreed upon is not proven either way yet so it still may agree with Einstein's. So ''we know why '''according to Einstein's theory''' things fall''. So far there is no better theory. Don't we want to tell it the readers because it's ''only a theory''? [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 05:17, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::::True, we know that motion in time occurs as well as motion in space, but we don't know that the time coeffiecent of SR (actually Lorentz), which is used in SR to make the speed of light "special," is the correct procedure or not.  The sacrifice of absolute values of space and time is an expediency that works mathematically, but it doesn't mean that there is a corresponding physical reality behind it.  That's why it is a theory, not a law.  By the same token, gravitational lensing does not prove the existence of the curvature of space, only that the effect is similar, but what if there is no such thing as space, as all observations to date indicate, then what?  

:::::" but what if there is no such thing as space [...]?" Then we are really in trouble because then there ain't such things as ''us'' neither (we can't exist without space, can we?)

::::::For space to be warped, curved or changed in any way by matter it has to exist as something, yet every observation, every experiment we know of has not been able to detect it.  It only exists in theory.  Current theory cannot account for gravity without a space continuum, a medium represented by a mathematical expression that can be changed by mass.  Computer simulations always depict it as a grid, yet no grid exists as far as we know.  There is no detectable physical phenomenon corresponding to a medium, or ether, or metric.  This is a fact.

:::::::We are supposed only to ''report what '''gravity''' is'' according to actual theories, especially Einstein's whose theory so far has ''no problems'' with explanation of all ''observed phenomena''. If the ''space'' as you suggest is not observed, Einstein's theory doesn't need ''to explain'' it, does it? We don't need to discuss here the deep philosophical problems of epistemology, only ''gravity''. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

::::This is exactly why experiments like the Gravity-B Probe continue to be fielded at such great expense.  We don't know if there is such a thing as "space" that can be curved, and we don't know what the meaning of "motion in time" really is.

::::::Here's what they say on their web site (http://einstein.stanford.edu/):

:::::::''General relativity is hard to reconcile with the rest of physics, and even within its own structure has weaknesses. Einstein himself was dissatisfied, and spent many years trying to broaden his theory and unify it with just one other branch of physics, electromagnetism . Modern physicists seeking wider unification meet worse perplexities. Above all, essential areas of general relativity have never been checked experimentally....''

:::::::''Moreover, deep theoretical problems -- some old and some new -- remain. Einstein himself remarked that the left-hand side of his field equation (describing the curvature of space-time) was granite, but that the right-hand side (connecting space-time to matter) was sand. The mathematical structures of general relativity and quantum mechanics, the two great theoretical achievements of 20th century physics, seem utterly incompatible. Some physicists, worried by this and by our continued inability to unite the four forces of nature -- gravitation, electromagnetism , and the strong and weak nuclear forces -- suspect that general relativity needs amendment.''

::::::"Deep theoretical problems" are their words, not mine.  The fact is, general relativity is a theory with "weaknesses" in its structure and certainly one of these is the assumption that space is a medium.

:::::::This is just a proof of what I already said: they list ''gravitation'' as one of "''four fundamental forces of nature''".

:::::::''Other more profound phenomena ...remain untested. Save for some indirect evidence from the binary pulsar, no data exist on gravitational radiation. Even less is known about a vitally important relativistic effect -- "frame-dragging."''

If matter/energy is the basic constituent of the universe and the fabric of space-time was generated and stretched out by the big bang, and this fabric is warped in the presence of matter/energy, then the next question is "How does matter warp space-time?"  "What is the nature of space-time that makes it susceptible to the effects of matter?"

Gravitation (''why things fall'') got explained once we found out ''how'' "warping the spacetime" causes gravitational effects: through geodesics in spacetime; explaining Newtonian orbits and all the rest of ''known'' gravitational phenomena. Now it is a problem of regular physics: "how (and possibly ''why'') matter warps the spacetime". So far we have it as a fact with an unknow reason and not known the way ''how'' matter is doing it. I.e. the metric of spacetime is still not known. So far it is ''assumed'' by many cosmologists that it is a Riemannian FLRW with expanding space and not conserved energy, but it might be that energy is conserved and the effect of expansion is an illusion as predicted by (partly forgotten) Einstein's theory, which would predict a differently warped spacetime. Possibly with ''non symmetric'' metric, as Einstein proposed it in 1950. Also very interesting and worth pursuing because it explains the accelerating expansion that we observe as a total illusion in a totally stationary universe.

== Observations vs Conjecture ==

To simplify the discussion I'm removing all the previous stuff in this section (still available in "history") and the items that don't relate to observatons and cause only theoretical problems. Even if those problems are tremendous they shouldn't consider us since the phenomena that they refer to are not observed (e.g. quantum gravity, big bang, black holes, etc.) What's left is:

''"We need to be able to explain at the quantum level how gravitational mass arises and is always equivalent to inertial mass."'' 
:It was in Newton's theory that "(passive) gravitational mass [] is always [equal] to inertial mass". Einstein solved this problem almost a century ago by showing that there is ''no (passive) gravitational mass''.
:: Einstein did not "solve the problem."  He merely postulated that gravitational mass is equivalent to a constantly accelerated mass.  However, this does not answer the question as to ''why'' they are the equivalent.
:::What's ''gravitational mass''? The mass that is accelerating is called ''inertial mass'' (or ''relativistic mass'') (gamma)m, where m is ''rest mass'' The (active) ''gravitational mass'' is the one that causes gravitational effects around it. So what do you mean by "gravitational mass" while asking about "equivalent" to inertial mass? What equation does define this mass? [[User:JimJast|Jim ]]

::::From [[Mass|Mass Wiki]]: Inertial mass is a measure of an object's inertia, which is its resistance to changing its state of motion when a force is applied. An object with small inertial mass changes its motion more readily, and an object with large inertial mass does so less readily. 
::::Gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object's interaction with the gravitational force. Within the same gravitational field, an object with a smaller gravitational mass experiences a smaller force than an object with a larger gravitational mass. (This quantity is sometimes confused with weight.) 

''"how does it act instantaneously at a distance?"''
:You talking again about Newton's theory. There is no such a problem in GR. Do you want to know why? [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 19:42, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)
::Look, I know about the quadrapole moment and all, but, again, confusing the theory with the observaations is what we want to avoid.  Observations of gravity show that it acts instantaneously from a distance, it cannot be screened or blocked off, and it cannot be modified.  GR postulates that this is because a 4D space-time metric is somehow warped in the presence of matter. Such a hypothesis squares with some of these observations, but not all.  For instance, the quadrapole moment must produce a  gravitational wave, which has not been observed.  Again, Newton had no theory of gravity.  His Universal Law of gravity did assume instantaneous action at a distance, but he disliked the idea as much as anyone else.  He simply did not know how to explain it, and refused to hypothesize ahout it, but that doesn't mean that it's not observed, because it is.

== Additions to Einstein's gravity section==

I added a missing section about physics of conservation of energy. IMHO it might be interesting to lay people becuase of the lack of gravitational forces accelerating free falling objects while kinetic energy of those objects is increasing. It often puzzles lay people since the physics of the automatic conservation of energy that math of [[general relativity]] assures through the vanishing divergence of <math>T_{\mu\nu}</math> isn't obvious. So I showed the physics of this phenomenon. 

There is also at the end of first section a new part about the true meaning of Newton's Law that makes Newton, for his refusal to interpret his equation as ''action at distance'', the fortuitious discoverer of ''geodesic motion in spacetime'' (in this case in Euclidean spatial hypersurface) with Einstein showing how to transfer this law in a covariant form into pseudo Riemannian geometry or into any other suitable geometry. 

If there is a NPOV concern about this piece, IMO it should be reformulated rather than deleted. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 19:15, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Comparison with electromagnetic force ==

"Attractive force" (non existent in gravitation) has been replaced by "interaction" that seems good enough a term to fit gravitation. 
The same in the previous section. [[User:JimJast|Jim ]] 18:41, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== noncovariant explanation ==
"It often puzzles students of Einstein's gravity that without any force acting at distance the kinetic energy of a free falling objects changes. The puzzling question is "where this kinetic energy is coming form where the object is moving down or going to when the object is moving up"? The old "gravitational field" of the "attractive force" that was considered to be a repository of this "gravitational energy" in Newton's gravity isn't any good any more since now, if "attractive force" is zero, so is the "gravitational field". We need to identify another repository for this energy.

As we know the total energy of an object is E = mc<sup>2</sup>, where m is so called "relativistic mass", and c is speed of light. When object falls "down" its kinetic energy goes up. Energy has mass and so m goes up. However c<sup>2</sup> drops down by the same amount since falling object gets into space where time is running slower (recall time dilation) and so the speed of light, as observed by the same observer who is seeing the increasing kinetic energy, is slower as well (that's why speed of light is not constant in gravitational field). If both m and c<sup>2</sup> change in opposite direction by the same amount the product, the total energy of the object stays the same for a free falling object. That's how the conservatoin of energy works in Einstein's gravity.

There is one important result of Einstein's gravity: to keep the change of c<sup>2</sup> the same as change of m there must be a relative increase in amount of space (space curvature) equal the relative time dilation. It might be said that the nature has to curve the space by the same amount as time gets dilated because of nature's inability to create energy from nothing."

:First of all, energy is only conserved in general relativity if spacetime possesses a timelike Killing vector field. Second of all, "relativistic mass" and "nonconstant speed on light" are outdated noncovariant concepts. [[User:Phys|Phys]] 14:11, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== I disagree with this edit. ==

I disagree with this edit.
''It should be noted that here, the word "cause" is not being used in the same sense as "cause and effect" or "the defendant caused the victim to die." Rather, when Newton uses the word "cause," he (apparently) is referring to what modern English-speakers call an "explanation." In other words, a phrase like "Newtonian gravity is the cause of planetary motion" means simply that Newtonian gravity explains the motion of the planets. It does not mean that Newtonian gravity (which is just an idea in someone's head) somehow sends planets telekinetically whirling through space. See Causality and Causality (physics).''

Newton was unhappy with ''cause'' in the sense of ''why''. Part of his revolution was to relax the need for ''why'' and simply describe ''what'', which we, as his intellectual descendants, call an ''explanation''. However Newton was still (unsuccessfully) looking for ''why'', and never found one. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 21:55, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)

As it stands, the paragraph is revisionist.

Let's see. ''The Principa'', Translated by ''Andrew Motte'', page 442, ''General Scholium''. In here Newton says:
:''Hitherto we have explained the phaenoma of the heavens and of our sea by the power of gravity, but have net yet assigned the cause of this power.''
So the first part of this edit looks okay, but I'm unsure of the latter! Obviously, if "Newtons Gravity" explains the motion, it is "on the surface" the cause for the planets to move in ellipses. However, "under the surface" the mathematical properties are not explained from deeper first principles, and so that "cause" is missing. So "Newtons Gravity" '''does''' somehow sends planets whirling, but it is unexplained through what mechanism. I would be in favor of changing the sentence. [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 01:24, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:Well, I don't know whether or not Newton was unhappy with "cause" in the sense of "why," but he does use it in the sense of "explanation."  For example, "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."  Objections and suggestions to sentences 3-4, however, seem reasonable to me, as their wording may be misleading.  My edit does not claim that Newton cared about an underlying explanation.  Nor does it claim that Newton didn't care.  So I don't see where the "revisionist" label applies.  If you think my wording doesn't convey what I just wrote here, go ahead and clarify it.  As far as where Newton actually stood, it appears to be a mixed bag.  On the one hand, he says, "Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done," but on the other hand, he also says, "For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena... have no place in experimental philosophy."  Draw what conclusions you wish.

== Newton & Calculus ==

I've heard that Newton couldn't convince himself that the law for point objects would also work for spherical heavenly bodies and hence didn't publish the theory until he invented the methods of calculus necessary to arrive at the total gravitational force of a sphere on a neighbouring point object. Should this be included in the article, e.g. under the "History" or "Newton's Reservations" sections? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:39, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
: I learned the same thing. But I learned his work was for Earth specifically, as the celestial bodies are far away (hence could be treated as points), and Newton needed to prove that his theory applied to Earth, and to the Moon, and to all the other bodies. I learned that he spent years trying to include the Moon, and couldn't solve the 3-body problem exactly. (He got headaches from the effort) But that didn't stop his publication, because he included the System of the World as volume 3. Since he solved it for Earth, I imagine it wasn't a reservation any longer for him.
Now that I think about it, I believe it is a theorem in Principia. Total force from a sphere is same as from a point that would have been located at the center of the sphere. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 22:56, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Newton's law and Planck units==

Does whoever wrote this section realize how large the [[planck mass]] is?  I am not disagreeing with their mathematics at this point.  What I would like them to realise is that the implication of the gravity not being transmited by a particle of less than the planck mass is that only large assemblies of particles can create a gravitational field while smaller particles can just react to a field that is already there. 

Consider the though experiment of taking a particle that is less than the planck mass and collapseing it into a black hole. If you do this you get a Schwarzschild radius that is less than the planck lenth. What do you get? --[[User:Hfarmer|Hfarmer]] 16:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)
:See [[Mach's principle]] and [[equivalence principle ]]. That is indeed the implication; that the totality of the fixed stars, and other large assemblages form our conception of gravitation. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 18:10, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I realize well how large the planck mass is. Indeed, it would be the "heaviest" and thereby smallest elemetary particle possible. But if the Planck mass would not exist in a "particle" per se but only as it's square (= hbar*c/G) you wouldn'n detect the "particle" when looking for a mass. And of course you hardly would detect it at all because it's so tiny. Consequently it appears questionable whether gravity really is transmitted by a particle or wave having whatever mass/energy. 

From the mathematics I believe that the "particle" we need to look for is a "real" square. Taking into account the Planck charge I would visualise this "particle" by four Planck charges sitting at the corners of the square at a distance of a Planck length and moving (rotating square) with the speed of light. This moving could be the basis of Planck impulse. If you would illuminate that rotating square with "strobe light" of Planck frequency and look to it, the charges would appear static but change their signs with Planck frequency. 

Because the charges get pretty much neutralised within the square the "particles" would not interact with their environment except transmitting impulses. Accordingly they would not appear in any instrument's reading. Therefore no wonder that the universe full of sqrt mP = hbar*c/G is largely considered to be pretty empty.

Only if you would "divide" the square into two dipoles with two Planck charges each at a distance of a Planck length within the dipole you would get the Planck mass. Guess that would be a difficult experiment and likely is the reason why we do not see Planck masses (their "weight" would be more than enough, in the microgram range, to be detected even as individual particles by simple instruments).

As far as black holes are concerned they are impossible if you accept the Planck length to be the smallest possible unit of length. Collapsing masses then cannot get a higher density than Planck density. If you do not accept the boundaries of Planck units (to save black hole theory) this means you cannot accept the natural constants to be constant either. As a consequence all calculations around  a black hole or other "singularities" that are based on or contain the conventional values of the natural constants would then be forbidden or wrong. 

What I therefore think really happens in a "black hole" is that the collapse results in Planck masses (dipoles mentioned) which then spontaneously associate (due to the huge attraction of the Planck charges) forming the squares as described. I.e. the masses therefore would disappear as such but "survive" as their squares (=hbar*c/G) at site.

: ([[User:William M. Connolley|William M. Connolley]] 22:11, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)) I've taken the section out again. If the ideas are your own, they don't belong in wiki: free web space, or the newsgroups, are readily available if you want to popularise your own ideas. OTOH, if they are someone elses, please reference them. Rewriting the equations in terms of new constants seems pointless: nothing is thereby gained. The pull/push stuff seems reminiscent of [[LeSage (gravity)]]... is this what you are thinking of? If not, I don't know what you are trying to say.


It will be in again with modifications (will take some while; comments on below are welcome to be considered). Rewritten equations I do not think belong to myself or anybody else but to the public. They are a matter of fact. 

What I'm ultimately thinking of is the following re-written equation:
 
Gravitational force = Sum of gravitational interactions between the protons and neutrons of two masses, each interaction expressed as 

[Planck Impulse * Planck Frequency * sqrt(Planck Length/wavelength of a neutron resp. proton) * sqrt(Planck Length/distance of interacting neutrons or protons)]


What is to be gained from the re-written equation are the following insights:

1. Transmission of Planck Impulses is the cause of gravity

2. Frequency of the impulse transmission is a fraction of Planck Frequency

3. The fraction of Planck Frequency is determined by two probabilities: sqrt(Planck Length/wavelength of a neutron or proton) and 
sqrt(Planck Length/distance of interacting neutrons resp. proptons)

4. The appearence of Planck Length within these probabilities suggests that the area of impulse transmission is of the size of sqrt of a Planck Length. 

As gravitational force is always attractive whereas impulse transmission is repellant it is obvious to think about a push model, without the need to involve Le Sage. And Le Sage never considered Planck units. 
However, the "gas" Le Sage was thinking of exists in reality, being hbar*c/G.

Transmission of Planck Impulses could happen without generating heat as long as it occurs fully isotropic. Only if the impulse transmission gets anisotropic it would result in acceleration of a proton or neutron.

Transmission of Planck Impulses also seems to be the key mechanism of the inertial force as mentioned earlier.

Briefly speaking, general relativity is a good theory which uses differential geometry and tensors to describe strong gravitational forces. But saying that gravity is weak is an oxymoron because according to the theory, gravity is not a force but a manifestation. 

However what the theory fails to explain is how the [[gravitational field]] really works. What is spacetime?

: I have a more simple approach as outlined earlier in the discussion and I think there is no mystery. 

It's just about disturbance of isotropicity of transmission of Planck impulses.   This transmission occurs at any time and anywhere with high (Planck) frequency. But because it happens fully isotropic there is no force being detected despite the Planck force (= Planck impulse per Planck time)is applying everywhere and all the time. It's applying this way because the Planck Force is the speed of light to the power of four divided by the gravitational constant, both constants being present everywhere at any time. 

If this isotropicity gets disturbed either by another mass (e.g. by "shielding" against transmission of Planck impulses) the excess (repellent) transmissions from the opposite side drive the particle towards the shielding mass. Also, if the isotropicity gets disturbed by applying a force to a particle, this force (= impulses per time) gets counteracted by the transmissions of impulses from the opposite side of the particle. This we experience as inertial force. - RABecker

== GR mistakes ==

I am not impressed with the GR part of this page, but am not in a good position to edit it.

First, the tendency of object to move towards a massive object in GR is due to [[geodesic deviation]], (which I hope to write on soon).  The change in time dilation, while closely associated with gravitaional potential, is '''not''' fundamentally the reason for gravitation.

Even if time dilation were known, noone would have known what to make of it or why it was associated with gravitation.  The reason for the illusion of gravity is because gravity does exist in accelerated frames of reference as a D'Almbertian force:  Since you are being accelerated, all objects in inertial motion must fall with respect to you.  The result is what is perceived as a gravitational field.

Also, gravitational potential is nothing more than the difference in kinetic energy that an object would have as a result of its being accelerated with respect to the observer between two positions.  (Yes.  That is the Newtonian definition.  Some things just don't change even in relativity.) There is no need to invoke changes in the speed of light, especially since such changes are in apparent contradiction to the constancy of the speed of light in SR.  (Yes.  I know that this is a real effect as perceived by an observer in accelerated frames even in SR.  However, it is an effect of gravitation instead of a cause and presenting it in this context will cause confusion).

----

I strongly advise against calling gravity a "manifestation of inertia".  My own preference is somewhat for "inertial force", but the technical term is "D'Albertian force".  Basically D'Almbert came up with a beautiful formalism of Newton's third law.  In the process, he showed that an observer being accelerated finds all inertially moving objects acting as if they are under the influence of a force which acts on the objects with a strength that is proportional to the mass of the object.  

Look at it this way:  Any observer, even an accelerated one, is always at rest with respect to themself.  So there is a frame of reference for the accelerated observer which is at rest with respect to that observer, and in which objects which maintain their position with respect to the accelerated observer are considered to be at rest.  However, inertially moving objects will not stay at rest in this frame of reference, but will instead accelerate with respect to it.  There is not a real force involved since it is the observer and not the object that is being accelerated, but from the standpoint of the accelerated observer the effect really is that of a force acting on the object.  That phenomenon is what Einstein refers to as a "gravitational field", and it exists in an accelerating rocketship in free space just the same as it does for us when we are standing on the surface of the Earth.

So the odd bottom line is that gravity is perfectly real even in GR.  It's just that in GR, we are in an accelerated frame of reference, and what we perceive as acceleration due to gravity is really inertial motion as it exists due to gravitation.  This automatically explains the equivalence of inertial and gravitaional mass:  It is a required attribute of a "D'Almbert force".  In essesnse the Equivalence Principle (or at least the weak version) is nothing more than a way of identifying a D'Almbert force and realizing that the observer is the one being accelerated instead of the objects in [[freefall]].

Of course the problem with using the term "D'Almbert force" or "D'Almbertian force" is that noone will understand it, and if I attack the article itself I will seek to avoid the term (even though I like it).  As I mentioned above, I would call gravity an "inertial force" since that is more easily definable.  I hate to call it "fictitious" since that does not keep you from getting killed if you should fall off of a cliff.  

Beyond that I strongly advise avoiding Cleon's suggestions in this matter.  He is fairly smart and capable in dealing with classical phenomena, but in the GR realm he just does not get it.  "Manifestation of inertia" is only half of the story.  Instead, gravity is intertial motion ''as it is perceived by an accelerated observer''.  Without telling the reader how gravity is related to inertia, you are only creating confusion.

== manifestation of inertia ==

Inertia is a rockbottom concept in physics. I use the expression 'manifestation of inertia' to express a dynamic process. When two objects are moving towards each other a force is required to reduce their relative speed to zero, and the necessity to exert a force in order to change velocity is called inertia. With inertia, the acceleration is proportional to the exerted force. Without inertia, objects would be instantly accelerated to lightspeed.

When an electric car designed to regain energy on decellerating is switched to braking then the manifestation of inertia is driving the generators, recharging the batteries. So the manifestation of inertia is doing [[work (physics)|work]]. Alternatively, you can do the accounting by stating that the batteries are doing negative work in the process of being recharged.

The way I like to do the accounting is to state that the manifestation of inertia is doing work. (It doesn't really matter, as long as you make sure that you keep track of conservation of energy.) One can also state this in the form that manifestation of inertia is involved in conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa.

I think the expression 'inertial force' is an oxymoron because there is one thing that manifestation of inertia cannot do: accelerate an object with respect to the inertial frame of reference. Manifestation of inertia arises in response to a force being exerted. When the force stops, the manifestation of inertia stops immediately too.

Inertia and manifestation of inertia have unique properties, and I think this justifies giving them a name of their own. 

The name 'fictitious force' is horrendous, I hate that expression so bad I can taste it. <BR>
--[[User:Cleon Teunissen|Cleon Teunissen]] | [[User talk:Cleon_Teunissen|Talk]] 11:17, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)


The expression 'fictitious force' is (I think) originally designed for the following type of situation: suppose you have a videocamera on a rotating platform, and it is recording a perfectly normal scene. Suppose you show the footage to some physicists, and ask them to ''retrofit'' force laws to what they see, on assumption that the camera is stationary. The force laws that they would retrofit do not represent anything real, so those retrofitted force laws describe ''imaginary forces''. The formula's for those retrofitted force laws are a spitting image of for example the dynamic law for centripetal force. In fact, in the mathematical derivation often the fictitious force law is derived, and then a minus sign is added to the formula (or removed, I forget).

Anyway, manifestation of inertia is real physics, of course, it's doing [[work (physics)|work]].<BR>

== The physics of Gravitation and Inertia ==

Both in Special relativity and in General relativity the following is valid: objects follow geodesics. In order to make an object deviate from moving along a geodesic a force must be exerted. Whenever a force is exerted, inertia manifests itself. (Attempts have been made to identify a physical cause for inertia, but on the whole inertia seems to be regarded as something that needs to be assumed "as is" in order to frame a theory.)

Free-fall straight towards a center of gravitation is motion that follows a geodesic. (the usual example to illustrate what a geodesic can look like is orbital motion, but free-fall straight towards a center of graviation is geodesic motion just as well).

An example: an electrically powered elevator cabin designed to regain energy on descent. If the cabin's descent would not be a controlled one the cabin would free-fall, accelerating towards the center of gravitation. When there is a controlled descent, then a manifestation of inertia arises, directed towards the center of gravitation. This manifestation of inertia is driving the electric generator, recharging the battery system, analogous to a decelerating electric car recharging its batteries. 

Metaphorically speaking: curvature of space-time geometry is "cheating". Space-time curvature changes the rules at the deepest level. In interstellar space, where the gravitation of surrounding stars evens out, space-time geometry is exceedingly close to Minkowski space, hence the geodesics there are very close to euclidean straight lines. A gravitating mass such as our planet Earth alters surrounding space-time geometry in such a way that inertial motion is motion towards the center of gravitation, and whenever a force prevents an object from moving towards the center of gravitation inertia manifests itself.


Because of the existence of inertia, acceleration with respect to the inertial frame of reference is proportional to the exerted force. Without the existence of inertia, gravitation wouldn't exist either. 

Before general relativity, inertia and gravitation were seen as separate phenomena. General relativity reveals underlying physics principles, bringing many aspects of physics into a unified theory. General relativity unifies the descriptions of gravitation and inertia. --[[User:Cleon Teunissen|Cleon Teunissen]] | [[User talk:Cleon_Teunissen|Talk]] 06:11, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

This "manifestation of inertia" business is so unique that I suspect that it can be described as "new research" under the rules of Wikipedia.

I am not contesting what you are saying, but the '''how'''.  Free-fall is inertia in GR.  That is a point that needs to be made.  That the force of the engine on the elevator is pushing it out of inertial motion instead of keeping it from accelerating is the point.  Instead you are declaring the interaction to be a "manifestation of inertia", and for someone who does not know what inertia is in GR, that term is useless, if not worse.

It is difficult not to inappropriately innovate in this forum.  I have had my face rubbed in that with the Equivalence Principle page, and it makes me all the more careful now to be sure that I am trying to communicate real and known concepts (even if it is in my own way) instead of introducing new and novel concepts.

The term "manifestation of inertia" is wholely unique to you, and its conceptual orientation is also unique to you.  As such, its use in Wikipedia is automatically questionable.  Combine that with its not communicating what GR is about effectively, and the use of this phrase ends up being inappropriate. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] 18:59, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, I have encountered the expression 'manifestation of inertia' in non-wikipedia related places that deal with physics. Inertia is a standard physics concept. Both in SR and in GR free moving objects move along geodesics. Moving along a geodesic is inertial motion. In order to make an object deviate from geodesic motion a force is required. None of that is a new conceptual orientation, that is all standard GR. 

:Of course, no single expression can explain GR in one big swoop. It is how an assembly of concepts is lined up in a coherent picture that constitutes explaining.

:: "Manifestation of inertia" may be a good physics concept, but it is not a good GR concept.  However, the trouble with using it in GR is not in what it says, but in what it does not say.

Free-fall is inertia in GR.  That is a point that needs to be made. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] 18:59, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:In attempting to communicate GR concepts, we have the following 2 aspects of GR:<BR>
:(1) When an object is in free-fall in the curved space-time surrounding a gravitating mass, then it is accelerating towards that gravitating mass. In general: two masses in free motion will accelerate towards their common center of mass.
:(2) Free-fall is inertial motion. Special relativity defines inertial frames of reference as those frames in which the speed of light is the same in all directions, and during free-fall we have that measurement of the speed of light yields the same velocity in all directions.

:Any attempt to communicate GR must show how GR reconciles those two aspects into a coherent picture. Merely stating that "Free-fall is inertia", without further explanation, is worthless. Opinions may differ on exactly how the reconciliation can be shown, but any attempt to explain GR must in some form present the wonderful GR resolution to the above issue.

:: I appreciate that too, which is one reason why I have not touched the aticle yet.  I also agree that making the point about free-fall being inertia involves more than writing one sentence.  However, that one sentence will be more valuable than taking about gravitation as a "manifestation...".

:: I have too many Wikipedia project in my queue.  What I want is for people to be aware the time dilation is an effect and not a cause of gravitation; that gravitational potential evergy even in GR is just as Newton described it:  the potential to obtain kinetic energy through free-fall.  In an accelerated frame of reference, that is a perfectly valid way of describing things.  In fact, through <math>E=mc^2</math> the mass of an object rises as it is raised up.

== Movement of photons ==

According to the thread between EMS and Cleon above, one contrast between the inertial motion of a body in free-fall and a photon traversing space is that the photon is theoretically not subject to gravitation, as it has no mass (Newton's 2nd law). But a photon traversing a geodesic, which might be bent by the presence of a huge mass, is subject to that mass (GR + geodesic equations). But if I understand this thread, both a body in free-fall and the photon are in inertial motion. The question then arises: Is there a way to impart rotational acceleration to a photon? [[Image:Science.jpg|right|thumb|100px|X-ray jets from a black hole]]In the presence of a black hole, as a star is getting squeezed and emits X-rays, spinning more and more rapidly, it appears that even those X-rays are not subject to rotational acceleration. Thus one formulation of ''inertial frame'' might be the ''frame of motion of a photon''. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 09:38, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

: The issue of whether a [[photon]] is subject to gravitation in [[Newton]]'s physics is debatable.  Surounding a massive object, everything is [[acceleration|accelerated]], and that can be interpreted as including photons.  The [[Equivalence principle]] left no doubt that this is in fact the case, but at the cost of losing Newton's view that gravity is a [[force]].

: In GR, massive objects follow [[timelike]] geodesics of spacetime, and photons follow [[lightlike]] geodesics of spacetime.  Inertial motion is experienced by following a timelike geodesic.  Photons are different in that since they are massless they automatically go as fast as they can (namely at ''c'' as viewed by any observer they happen to be passing) and therefore cannot be accelerated.  This is not to say that they are unaffected by the presense of massive objects or by whether the massive object is rotataing.  Such things affect the spacetime itself.  So a photon passing the Sun is deflected because the spacetime has become curved.  Also, since the [[fabric]] of [[spacetime]] is somewhat pulled along by a rotataing object, a photon will have some rotation imparted to its motion by a rotataing massive object in its vicinity.  (Note however that this is affecting where the photon goes.  There is another interpretation to "rotataing a photon", but I really don't think that you are refering to [[Polarization|polarized light]].)

: The "frame of motion of a photon" is not useful.  An observer on a photon experiences no [[proper time]].  When it comes to GR and gravity, I strongly council that people keep the discussion short and simple and use a minimum of GR itself.  There are plenty of other places for GR in its full glory to be discussed (such as in the [[general relativity]] page itself).  In GR, spacetime is curved as dictated by the [[Einstein field equations]] and the presense of [[mass]],[[energy]], and [[momentum]] in the spacetime.  The paths that objects take are governed by [[geodesics]] of [[spacetime]] as described above.  Given a lack of knowledge of [[curvature]], it is easiest to treat gravitation as being due to a [[force]] (namely [[gravity]]).  This article really does not need to say much more than that, although talking about the [[perihelion]] [[precession]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the bending of light by the [[Sun]] are not inappropriate.  A mention of [[black hole]]s is also not unreasonable.

== Gravitation and the propagation of light ==

:Thus one formulation of ''inertial frame'' might be the ''frame of motion of a photon''. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 09:38, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

Indeed, in his explorations of theoretical physics, Einstein relied on the propagation of light to guide his intiutions.

Like all classical wave-mechanical models, Maxwell's equations describe that electromagnetic waves spread into space as a spherically symmetrical wave-front, so you get an equality like c^2t^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2. Einstein proposed for special relativity that ''all'' observers that move inertially observe a spherically symmetrical "expanding" wave-front. So instead of '''one''' ether you have in a sense a superposition of all ethers, which can be seen as a superposition of the symmetry-group of all inertial frames of reference of Minkowski space-time.

Special relativity unified two concepts of relativity of inertial motion. The kinematic concept, and the wave-mechanical concept. Special relativity says the two following things '''coincide''': a mechanical accelerometer does not register acceleration, and (interferometric) measurement of the speed of light yields isotropy in all directions. 

The online book ''[http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm reflections on relativity]'' by the mathematician and astrophysicict  [http://www.magicdragon.com/math.html Jonathan Vos Post] is a rich source of ideas. From 
[http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s1-04/1-04.htm section 1.4 The dilemma of light]: 
::(E2') The speed of light with respect to any system of inertial coordinates is isotropic and independent of the state of motion of the source.
:This form emphasizes the fact that this principle can be regarded as an assertion of wave-particle duality for light, because if light behaves like material particles its speed ought to be isotropic with respect to any inertial frame, and if light consists of a wave in a material medium its speed ought to be independent of the state of motion of the source, whereas the above principle asserts that light exhibits both of these characteristics. In this sense, we see that the wave-particle duality commonly associated with quantum mechanics is actually at the core of special relativity as well. (It's not surprising that Einstein was occupied with a paper on light quanta at the same time that he was formulating his ideas about relativity.)

::: This is an interesting insight, but has nothing to do with inertial motion.  Indeed, the whole point on inertial motion is lost in description.  Inertial motion happens which there are no [[force]]s acting on you.  Your being in an [[inertial]] [[frame of reference]] can be inferred by the lack of an apparent force that acts on all object in direct proportion to their mass.

::: --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] 15:57, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

In relativistic physics, the way gravitation affects photons cannot be understood in terms of force. The only way to understand gravitational bending of light is to consider the wave-mechanical properties of the propagation of light.

::: That is a 1911 view, and it gives an answer that is off by a factor of 2 (being the same as the Newtonian one).  Light follows lightlike geodesics through a curved spacetime.  In essense, gravitation causes the path taken by light to appear to be bent as it is perceived by a distant observer.

::: --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] 15:57, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

In a Minkowski space-time diagram, a shift from one Lorentz frame to another can be represented as a rotation over a particular angle in space-time, involving the time-coordinate and at least one space-coordinate. The space-time surrounding a gravitating mass can be represented as rotated over an angle with respect to flat space-time; the closer to the gravitating mass the further away from the state of flat space-time geometry. (There is "rotation" with respect to multiple axes of rotation, hence curvature of space-time cannot be represented as a vector field.) 

During acceleration in gravitationfree space the speed of light is not isotropic. If you are stationary (or in uniform motion) with respect to the center of gravitaiton of a gravitaing mass, then the speed of light is not isotropic. However, if you accelerate towards a center of gravitation, at exactly the gravitational acceleration, then the two anisotropies largely even out, and locally isotropy of space is restored. 

:The question then arises: Is there a way to impart rotational acceleration to a photon? [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 09:38, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

When two atomic clocks are on a rotating disk, one halfway between the hub and the rime and the other at the rim, and they relay some of their photons to each other, then the recieved photons will not match the frequency of the "home-brew" photons. The difference in frequency will be consistent with the fact that the two clocks are in different Lorentz frames, with a correponding difference in rate of time. It would introduce inconsistency in the model to assume that something happens to the photons during transit. (Or worse: to assume that some kinematic momentum is imparted to the photons. Yukh!) Likewise: in the propagation of light in curved space-time it would introduce inconsistency to assume that something happens to the photons during transit. (Anyway, with photons, you can measure only once, so you can't compare.) <BR>
--[[User:Cleon Teunissen|Cleon Teunissen]] | [[User talk:Cleon_Teunissen|Talk]] 11:22, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::: The idea that "something happens" to the photons is actually one way of viewing it.  As for the photons having some momentum imparted to them due to the movement of their source:  That does happen, affecting the direction in which the photons are perceived to go and even their energy (although the time dilation effect is a far simpler way of describing the red-shifting).  So what your "yukh" is aimed at is actually good physics.

::: --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] 15:57, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

It is customary to understand doppler shift in terms of different velocities, it can also be understood in terms of difference in rate of time. It doesn't really matter, but thinking about doppler shift in terms of difference in rate of time can help to "blend" it into the rest of relativistic physics. --[[User:Cleon Teunissen|Cleon Teunissen]] | [[User talk:Cleon_Teunissen|Talk]] 11:40, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

== A quick question about the article... ==

''As we know the total energy of an object is E=mc², where m is the so-called "relativistic mass", and c is the speed of light. When an object falls "down" its kinetic energy goes up. Energy has mass and so m goes up. However c2 drops down by the same amount since the falling object gets into space where time is running slower (recall time dilation) and so the speed of light, as observed by the same distant observer who is seeing the increasing kinetic energy, is slower as well (that's why the speed of light is not constant in a gravitational field). If both m and c2 change in opposite directions by the same amount, the product (the total energy of the object) stays the same for a free falling object. That's how the conservation of energy works in Einstein's gravitation.''


Doesn't this mean that nothing actually ever drops into a black hole ie. reaches the event horizon? If the speed of light 'slows' near the event horizon to a near 0 wouldn't it mean the distance to such a ''horizon'' would be infinite?
:Dunno if this helps but I found it an interesting tangent; according to Andromeda series co-executive producer (and head writer) Robert Hewitt Wolfe, talking about the space ship 'stuck' at the event horizon: "If it were just the event horizon by itself, the point at which time really does slow down sufficiently is about 2 feet away from the actual event horizon. At that point the gravity tides would tear you apart molecule by molecule long before a time dilation could take place. At least we know we cheated." - I guess he's looked at the science???[http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/andromeda_overview_000502.html] [[User:SeanMack|SeanMack]] 14:51, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

The important fact about the event horizon is that is "easy to see" for an outside observer, but not for an object falling towards the black hole. If you imagine yourself surviving traveling towards it, there would be nothing holding you back from falling further in. For an outside observer, however, the time dilation becomes very large when the object (= you) nears the event horizon, so it seems to that observer that you never fall in. [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 22:07, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Well yes and no to the issue of an object never entering a black hole as seen by an outside observer.  As the next object comes in behind the previous one, the event horizon rises up towards it.  It does not pull in the current object, but it does pull in the previous one.  Or so I have been told.

:: Also, an observer gets to and enters a black hole in finite proper time, which is considered to be more important than external/coordinate time.

:: Beyond that, if the black hole business looks odd to you, you are not alone.  I do not like it either.  However, black holes are a [[theorem]] of [[general relativity]] (GR), so that concept will not be removed without modifying GR itself somehow. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:59, 10 May 2005 (UTC)


:: One more thing:  In GR, the kinetic energy an object gains through free-fall is still offset by the loss of potential energy, just as is the case in [[classical mechanics]].  This business of light slowing down is '''bogus''' in terms of its reducing the mass of the object.  It should be noted that the retardation of light is an affectation of how measurements are made in relativity.  Locally, the speed of light always remains ''c''.  It is as observed in a gravitational field that this retardation occurs.  In fact, the loss of mass/energy in a gravitational field is proportional to the square of the time dilation factor, while the slowing down of light is proportional to the '''square''' of the time dilation factor.  So not only is this the wrong concept, but it also produces the wrong answer!

:: I disagree.  At least my understanding is that '''gravity''' is an attractive ''force'' acting between objects, whereas '''gravitation''' refers to the tendency of objects to move towards each other.  So Newton's theory describes gravity, whereas Einstein's describes gravitation.  [In [[general relativity|GR]], no [[force]] is in [[action (physics)|action]].  Instead the way massive objects cause [[spacetime]] to [[curvature|curve]] results in [[inertial]]/[[geodesic]] [[motion]] in which objects undergo [[coordinate]] [[acceleration]] (as opposed to physical acceleration, which would involve a force) towards each other.]

== Gravity ==

We seem to observe conditions and then set mathimatical formulas around these observations.  Gravity, we call an attraction.  We know two or more objects tend to come together but how can we tell if these objects are being pulled together or pushed together?  We can't see, touch, feel, or get our arms around it yet we have concluded that gravity is an attraction.  If mass absorbs energy (the same energy we attribute to attraction) we would obviously see the same result.

===Gauss's Law of Gravitation?===

The electromagnetic form of Gauss's Law is an invaluable aid in developing equations for electric fields. While I realize that the gravitational field concept is not as well-developed as the electric field concept (In my gravitation course we dealt exclusively with forces, and used all the same line-after-line-of-integrals methods to solve gravitation problems as Newton himself probably did), the analogies that one can draw using Gauss's Law of electromagnetism suggests very powerfully to me that developing a fully-fledged usable Gauss's Law of gravitation would be an excellent pedagogical advance in teaching gravitation courses particularly at the college or university level.

Up until now the only treatment I have seen regarding Gauss's Law of gravitation has been to treat it as a theoretical curiosity in problem sets in electromagnetism texts amounting to "Develop from first principles Gauss's Law of gravitation and show that it is essentially identical to Gauss's Law of electromagnetism", whereupon if you crank through the formulas you get the familiar integral g dot n dA = 4*pi*G*M , which can be shown to be essentially equivalent to integral E dot n dA = 4*pi*k*Q.

But surely there is more use for it than just treating it as a theoretical curiosity. Would someone be kind enough to develop a section on the use of Gauss's Law in gravitation problems?

Re: Awolf002.  Thanks for your comments above, it makes a change for people to delete other people's contributions repeatedly and then admit to it.  Surely the idea of this particular enclclopedia, and what gives it a unique appeal, is that it sets out to reduce the barriers and red tape.  The material I would like to insert has been published and checked.  Either Wikipedia is going to be a laggard encyclopedia, or it is going to be ahead of the rest.  Facts are not really open to debate, unlike opinions.  If you have a disproof of the established facts, namely that the recession of galaxies away from us involves speeds increasing linearly with time past (not necessarily with distance, which varies while the light and gravitational influences come to us at light speed), and Newton's laws, then you are welcome to state them.  I have heard all of the objections against "new" knowledge, and these facts are 10 years old, have been on the CERN Document Server, and in Electronics World which has more readers (and readers qualified in physics!) than most scientific journals (which are biased in favour of string "theory" which goes nowhere).  If you look at the history of science, you see that the greatest enemy can be the humble teacher and encyclopedia compiler, who relies on authority.  With dictators of "string" theory suppressing me for 10 years, it is obvious that everyone alive today will be dead and buried before these facts get known if I can't slip them into Wikipedia.  My internet site has been getting 200-1,400 hits per month.  However there is no mechanism to get "peer" review in Nature or Classical and Quantum Gravity, since the peer reviewers of those journals are mainstream string "theorists".  Why should readers of this encyclopedia be denied access to the proved facts which have been discussed between more physicists - practical physicists (working in electronics, designing the computers used to host Wikipedia) - than would be the case for Classical and Quantum Gravity?

It's not original.  It's published.  Please look before you leap into dismissing it as original:

Jan '04 paper "Solution to a problem with general relativity" CERN EXT-2004-007 (http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search.py?recid=706468&ln=en) states: "It was proposed that a mechanism of gravity should be developed to rigorously test all of the consequences of the physical fluid model for the fabric of space." Instead of 10 dimensional, conscious, and multiverse space speculation, consider what physics can do to prove the cause of gravity with real experimentally-proved properties of space.

: This is a [[preprint]] paper. Please, provide where it was published in a peer-reviewed publication or cited by any paper(s) in such periodicals. If the CERN paper server works like ''arXiv'', then all you succeeded in was submitting a file that complied with the ''format'' rules of that server, right? [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 02:02, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Edwin Hubble when discovering the redshift evidence for the big bang in 1929 made the experimental error of saying H = velocity/distance which leads to cosmological problems today; the observable fact is time past, since distances can vary while the light comes to us. Individual galaxies are accelerating away in the space-time we observe in which distance is linked to time-past. We see and are affected by the past; the higher speeds refer both to earlier periods in the evolution of the universe and to greater distances. 
This means:
(1) recession speed in big bang divided by time past we are seeing = constant acceleration,
(2) F=ma so constant outward force of big bang,
(3) Newton's 3rd law so inward force towards every point. The force/area or pressure acting inward thus goes as inverse square law with correct strength to within 1.65% if using consistent supernova-observation data published in Physical Review Letters and other peer-reviewed journals on the expansion rate and observed density (although the errors are about +/-20% in the data, not the 1.65% coincidence). See proof at: http://nigelcook0.tripod.com/ or http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/

The popular model of general relativity, as causing a flat surface like a rubber sheet to curve is unhelpful since physical space fills volume, not surface area.  This surface manifold model of space has stifled progress in physics.

‘In many interesting situations… the source of the gravitational field can be taken to be a perfect fluid…. A fluid is a continuum that ‘flows’... A perfect fluid is defined as one in which all antislipping forces are zero, and the only force between neighboring fluid elements is pressure.’ – Bernard Schutz, General Relativity, Cambridge University Press, 1986, pp. 89-90.

No matter how much you want to find some of the proved facts above wrong to dismiss this as crackpottery, you can't without saying proved physics is wrong.   These facts are widely known in the physics community, but are being suppressed by the string theory lobby from that (crackpot) side.  They are widely known in Electronics World, CERN etc.

'''137:''' First of all, please, stop forcing your text into the article. This is very '''rude''', and can lead to a lengthy blocking of your access to Wikipedia!

'''213.137''':The retrospective facts on the cited web page are intriguing. However, it reads like a lot of cut and paste, you need to edit and present the statements with a single voice. The retrospective statements will not have the power and persuasiveness of an ''inference'' from a unified picture which you should be proposing. 

If you state some logical consequences of your point of view, and then back up those inferences with some experiments designed to test your logical consequences, then you will attract some attention from the scientific community. 

Thus in the publications of your article, are there any predictions of a hither-to unknown effect? (For example, is the acceleration in the expansion of the universe always linear with time? How does this match to the cosmic inflation idea?) Merely to ''curve-fit'' some selected observations ("facts"), is as non-illuminating as the list of all the stock prices for all history; where is the predictive power of all those stock prices? If you counter that you are not getting published, there are many other researchers in the same fix. 

But try writing an article with a uniform style (Not just camping on the gravity article, but some other venue, with a theme and some point-by-point statements.). There are guides in this encyclopedia for good style. Try to avoid the Talk page conversation style you have been using. Make your case. You have references. Go for it. But not in the Gravity article; that is too well known and too well watched for you to try to make a splash there. I have to warn you that you have not made a good impression on the community of editors here. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 00:54, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== Wikipedia policy with regards to this matter ===

From section 2 of the [[NPOV|Wikipedia NOPV policy]]: 
:"''If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.''"  
If Bryan is correct, then he will eventually win the Nobel Prize, and this encyclopedia will have been long before updated to discuss his ideas.  In the meantime, we must remember this from the NPOV policy:
: "''Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, which means it is a representation of human knowledge at some level of generality.''"
It is not a part of current human knowledge that Bryan is right or even that he may be right.  For that reason, Bryan's ideas do not belong here.  Bryan chided us above about whether Wikipedia will be laggard or ahead of the rest:  The answer very much is that Wikipedia is going to be, due to the nature of its mission, laggard.  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:25, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Everything above by EMS57fcva is speculative and contrary to the facts: for example "Nobel prize" has nothing whatsoever to do with providing people with knowledge, and is controlled by the string lobby; in any case in discussions published in peer-reviewed Electronics World papers (see references cited on my internet page, some of the peer-reviewers are not anonymous; for example Dr David S. Walton, former assistant professor of physics, Trinity College, Dublin) and elsewhere Catt and I have pointedly make the case that this work is not egotism.  The reporting of widely discussed peer-reviewed facts on physics.

The credit goes mainly to four people which do not include myself so I am not eligible for any prize, despite having actually written up and seen to publication the facts.  Newton, Hubble, Einstein, and Schultz provided the facts.

Bryan (I know this editor's name is Bryan, courtesy of his references) -

First and foremost:  Your idea does not belong in the Gravity article '''even ''if'' it is true''', per the [[NPOV]] policy.  That is the main issue, and there is nothing speculative about it.  (If you are saying that my saying that you may win the Nobel Prize is speculative, then I am more than happy to agree you, by the way.)  Not only is your idea lacking in acceptance, but the scope of the article is Newton's theory anyway. 

As for the facts that you cite:  I do not contest them.  What I do contest is your ''interpretation'' of those facts.  It is not a given that they mean that gravity is due to the shielding that you describe.  In fact, general relativity provides a much more elegant explanation for those observations, and the accelerating expansion of the universe is describable within its context.  

The comments in your web pages on GR shows that you have a limited understanding of that theory.  Those of us who are familiar with it are not too bothered with ''G = 8&pi;T'' being uninformative to the uninitiated (not that this is a good thing).  Also, it was [[Minkowski]] who added time to the manifold to create the concept of spacetime, not [[Riemann]].  As someone who was inspired by his own attempts to modify GR to take courses on it, I strongly call on you to do the same, and in your case I would study string theory too.  If nothing else, "know thy enemy". 

Finally, a piece of advice:  You will get nowhere if you insist on treating the failure of your ideas to be published in respectable peer-reviewed journals as being the fault of others instead of yourself.  It speaks of your views that they have been published in ''Electronics World'' and not ''Physical Review D''.  If journals like ''Nature'' and ''Physical Review'' are rejecting your paper without even a peer review, that speaks even more strongly against it.  My own experience is that well thought out and thoughfully presented ideas have little trouble obtaining a peer review, not that it is easy to get new ideas past one (as my ideas have yet to do).  It is your job to speak to the field and to put your ideas into a form where the editors of respectable journals are willing to publish them.  It is not anyone else's job to understand or accept them.  In their current form your ideas are more speculation than theory.  You need to realize that and to realize that you have to show how your ideas differ from and improve on GR before you can legitimately seek publication.  All that your attitude about string theorists dominating the discussion does is to freeze you and your ideas in place.  Given that, your ideas will never go anywhere.  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:43, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I stated this on the webpage, so glad you have read it for information!  But please don't patronise.  When I help others by providing peer-reviewed information suppressed by Edward Witten, it is not appreciated that people insult me!  Please learn the rudiments of courtesy and science before involving yourself in this matter in future.  Thanks.

In response to the comments of Ancheta Wis above, I have updated my style on http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/   In particular, the facts of the Hubble discovery and Newton's 2nd and 3rd laws:

Fact 1: big bang is receding galaxies with speed increasing linearly with time past, v/t = constant acceleration in observable space-time

Fact 2: by Newton’s 2nd law, F = ma, the mass of receding galaxies times this acceleration is outward force of big bang explosion

Fact 3: by Newton’s 3rd law, every force has an equal and opposite reactive force: so equal inward force (like an implosion type nuclear weapon)

This inward force is carried by space around accelerating matter, so the inward pressure (force/area) is the inverse-square law, causing gravitation where shielded by mass. The correct force of gravity is proved below (http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/ ) : F = mMG/r2, where G = (3/4) H2/( p r local e3 ) = 0.0119H2/r local = 6.7 x 10-11 Nm2kg-2. This is not speculative: all 3 facts above are hard experimental results. Electromagnetism and nuclear forces are well-known energy exchange processes, but gravity is not.

: Interesting.  This may be a variation of the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]].  BTW - That was also based on known facts and did not work out either. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 29 June 2005 23:34 (UTC)

Science is not an authority-dictated enterprise, like some third world dictatorship. Proved facts are not points of view, they are not opinions, not personal pet theories. Newton’s laws and the big bang are not drivel. Unlike politics, science is controlled by natural facts, not by the authority of Stephen Hawking or some political type leader. If the boots fit, wear them. Professor Stephen Hawking may or may not know or care about the mechanism of gravity, but we do not all have to follow the example of others and bury our heads in the sand like Witten: http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/Gribbin.htm

Edwin Hubble in 1929 made the experimental reporting error of assuming he had measured constant velocity/distance, which leads to the cosmological problems today; the observable fact is time past, since distances can vary while the light comes to us. He should have reported constant velocity/time past, hence constant acceleration. If somehow light went instantly and we could see and be affected by where things are in the universe at the same time, 15,000 million years after the big bang, we would not see any acceleration, but this we cannot do. We live in a universe where we always see things as they were in the past, and influences like gravity travel at the speed of light. This is observed fact. Individual galaxies are accelerating away in the space-time we observe in which distance is linked to time-past. We see and are affected by the past; the higher speeds refer both to earlier periods in the evolution of the universe and to greater distances. (In any real explosion, such as nuclear tests in space in 1962 or just TNT detonated in a vacuum, the outward speeds are greater at the greatest distances, because debris remaining near the origin has suffered equal impacts from all directions during the explosion, and has not picked up an outward speed.)

‘In many interesting situations… the source of the gravitational field can be taken to be a perfect fluid…. A fluid is a continuum that ‘flows’... A perfect fluid is defined as one in which all antislipping forces are zero, and the only force between neighboring fluid elements is pressure.’ – Bernard Schutz, General Relativity, Cambridge University Press, 1986, pp. 89-90.

: That is meant as an analogy.  It is a highly useful one, I will admit, but still an analogy. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 29 June 2005 23:34 (UTC)

The facts above are not a theory.  They are not new.  They have been around for a very long time.  Newton's laws since 1687, Hubble's discovery since 1929, Schutz in 1986.

EMS57fcva and Awolf002 seem to taking the regular approach of insisting that Newton, Hubble, and Schutz should be suppressed, or that the facts above are just some "interpretation" (which is the only correct one since the recession speeds are linked to time past by the fact of light speed) that is too new or radical or unorthodox to be mentioned by Wikipedia.  When I point out that it is not new, I am then called a failure for getting it published a decade ago in a journal with 60,000 readers.  
: 60,000 readers, yes.  But how many of them have a good understanding of non-Euclidean geometry, cosmology, and string theory? --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 29 June 2005 23:34 (UTC)
This is interesting, because the reason why I have been pursuing this particular path is this sort of speculation.  In order for you to decide that I have failed by having it published, you have to speculate on what I want to do. Suppose that I would ideally like these facts to continue being suppressed by the media for another year, so that I can point out how silly and intolerant people have been.  In that case, it would hardly make me a failure to have not received widespread recognition a decade ago!  That is the danger of presuming what someone is motivated by.  I did actually have a hearing defect as a child which affected my speech and made me well aware of intolerance and ridicule of anyone different, and although that is cleared up now, I am left with a thick skin.

‘You sometimes speak of gravity as essential & inherent to matter; pray do not ascribe that notion to me, for ye cause of gravity is what I do not pretend to know, & therefore would take more time to consider of it… That gravity should be innate inherent & essential to matter so yt one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum wthout the mediation of any thing else by & through wch their action or force may be conveyed from one to another is to me so great an absurdity ...’ – Isaac Newton, Letter to Richard Bentley, 1693.

‘But if, meanwhile, someone explains gravity along with all its laws by the action of some subtle matter, and shows that the motion of planets and comets will not be disturbed by this matter, I shall be far from objecting.’ – Isaac Newton, Letter to Leibniz, 1693.

‘To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever... Recapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of relativity, space is endowed with physical qualities... therefore there exists an ether. According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable.’ – Albert Einstein, Leyden University, 1920. (Einstein, A., Sidelights on Relativity, Dover, New York, 1952, pp. 15, 16, and 23.)

‘The Michelson-Morley experiment has thus failed to detect our motion through the aether, because the effect looked for – the delay of one of the light waves – is exactly compensated by an automatic contraction of the matter forming the apparatus.’ – Professor A.S. Eddington, MA, MSc, FRS (Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, Cambridge), Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1921, p. 20.

‘The idealised physical reference object, which is implied in current quantum theory, is a fluid permeating all space like an aether.’ – Sir Arthur Eddington, MA, DSc, LLD, FRS, Relativity Theory of Protons and Electrons, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1936, p. 180.

‘Looking back at the development of physics, we see that the ether, soon after its birth, became the enfant terrible of the family of physical substances. First, the construction of a simple mechanical picture of the ether proved to be impossible and was discarded. This caused to a great extent the breakdown of the mechanical point of view. Second, we have to give up the hope that through the presence of the ether sea, one co-ordinate system will be distinguished and lead to the recognition of absolute and not only relative motion. … After such bad experiences, this is the moment to forget the ether completely and to try never to mention its name. We shall say our space has the physical property of transmitting waves and so omit the use of a word we have decided to avoid. The omission of a word from our vocabulary is of course no remedy; the troubles are indeed much too profound to be solved in this way. Let us now write down the facts which have been sufficiently confirmed by experiment without bothering any more about the ‘e---r’ problem.’ – Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld, Evolution of Physics, 1938, pp. 184-5; written to get Jewish Infeld out of Nazi Germany and accepted as a worthy refugee in America. (Einstein was against ether in 1905 to wide praise from politicians, because ether had bogged physics down in speculation, but then in his inaugural lecture at Leyden in 1920 Einstein said ‘According to the general theory of relativity, space without ether is unthinkable’, and in 1938 conceded defeat at the e---r word!)

‘… with the new theory of electrodynamics we are rather forced to have an aether.’ – P.A.M. Dirac, ‘Is There an Aether?,’ Nature, v.168, 1951, p.906. See also Dirac’s paper in Proc. Roy. Soc. v.A209, 1951, p.291.

‘It has been supposed that empty space has no physical properties but only geometrical properties. No such empty space without physical properties has ever been observed, and the assumption that it can exist is without justification. It is convenient to ignore the physical properties of space when discussing its geometrical properties, but this ought not to have resulted in the belief in the possibility of the existence of empty space having only geometrical properties... It has specific inductive capacity and magnetic permeability.’ - Professor H.A. Wilson, FRS, Modern Physics, Blackie & Son Ltd, London, 4th ed., 1959, p. 361. 

‘Scientists have thick skins. They do not abandon a theory merely because facts contradict it. They normally either invent some rescue hypothesis to explain what they then call a mere anomaly or, if they cannot explain the anomaly, they ignore it, and direct their attention to other problems. Note that scientists talk about anomalies, recalcitrant instances, not refutations. History of science, of course, is full of accounts of how crucial experiments allegedly killed theories. But such accounts are fabricated long after the theory had been abandoned. ... What really count are dramatic, unexpected, stunning predictions: a few of them are enough to tilt the balance; where theory lags behind the facts, we are dealing with miserable degenerating research programmes. 

‘Now, how do scientific revolutions come about? If we have two rival research programmes, and one is progressing while the other is degenerating, scientists tend to join the progressive programme. This is the rationale of scientific revolutions. ... Criticism is not a Popperian quick kill, by refutation. Important criticism is always constructive: there is no refutation without a better theory. Kuhn is wrong in thinking that scientific revolutions are sudden, irrational changes in vision. The history of science refutes both Popper and Kuhn: on close inspection both Popperian crucial experiments and Kuhnian revolutions turn out to be myths: what normally happens is that progressive research programmes replace degenerating ones.’ - Imre Lakatos, Science and Pseudo-Science, pages 96-102 of Godfrey Vesey (editor), Philosophy in the Open, Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1974.

‘You will say to me… Do you mean to tell me that a planet looks at the sun, sees how far it is, calculates the inverse square law of the distance and then decides to move in accordance with that law?’ In other words, although I have stated the mathematical law, I have given no clue about the mechanism.’ – Nobel Laureate Professor R.P. Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, Penguin, London, 1992, p. 33, emphasis added.

‘All charges are surrounded by clouds of virtual photons, which spend part of their existence dissociated into fermion-antifermion pairs. The virtual fermions with charges opposite to the bare charge will be, on average, closer to the bare charge than those virtual particles of like sign. Thus, at large distances, we observe a reduced bare charge due to this screening effect.’ – I. Levine, D. Koltick, et al., Physical Review Letters, v.78, 1997, no.3, p.424.


To Ems: if you wish to dismiss all the viewpoints above on the physical fabric of space as being the physical basis for gravitation, from Einstein onwards, that is personal opinion.  You are entitled to do this.  However, if you wish for a more pleasant discussion please stop deleting mainstream viewpoints.  I understand that you favour the string lobby.  However, there is no successful string theory.  String theory is an attempt to unify field theory and relativity via adding extra dimensions.  It fails to predict gravity, despite arm-waving claims from the likes of Edward Witten.  General relativity and special relativity both imply a contraction, physical space pressure:

This inward pressure makes the radius of the earth contract by a distance of 1.5-mm. This was predicted by Einstein’s general relativity, which Einstein in 1920 at Leyden University said proved that: ‘according to the general theory of relativity, space without ether [physical fabric] is unthinkable.’ The radius contraction, discussed further down this page, is GM/(3c2). (Professor Feynman makes a confused mess of it in his relevant volume of Lectures, c42 p6, where he gives his equation 42.3 correctly for excess radius being equal to predicted radius minus measured radius, but then on the same page in the text says ‘… actual radius exceeded the predicted radius …’ Talking about ‘curvature’ when dealing with radii is not helpful and probably caused the confusion. The use of Minkowski light ray diagrams and string ‘theory’ to obfuscate the cause of gravity with talk over ‘curved space’ stems to the false model of space by the surface of a waterbed, in which heavy objects roll towards one another. This model when extended to volume type, real, space shows that space has a pressurised fabric which is shielded by mass, causing gravity.) But despite this insight, Einstein unfortunately overlooked the Hubble acceleration problem and failed to make the link with the big bang, the mechanism of gravity, which is proved below experimentally with step by step mathematics.

Above is from http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/ which also includes a discussion of general relativity mathematics, and of the physical basis of those equations.

Many thanks for replying, Nigel

Yours is not a mainstream viewpoint.  If it was, you would not be reduced to trying to promote it on the gravity page of Wikipedia.

Actually, I don't.  However, I know that from your viewpoint I may as well.  Please see my "piece of advice" to you above again.  Giving you that advice is all that I can do to help you. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 30 June 2005 15:07 (UTC)

=== "Closing the book" ===

I think that it is time to close the book on this business.  To make my case, I will quote from the above quotations of Imre Lakatos (from Science and Pseudo-Science, pages 96-102 of Godfrey Vesey (editor), Philosophy in the Open, Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1974)

: "''Now, how do scientific revolutions come about? If we have two rival research programmes, and one is progressing while the other is degenerating, scientists tend to join the progressive programme.''"

I do not see that Nigel's program is progressing.  Instead I see it as being pretty much stuck in place where it was 10 years ago, offering an alternate explanation for that which is already explained.

:"''Important criticism is always constructive: there is no refutation without a better theory.''"

This points out Nigel's worse sin.  He keeps refusing to accept criticism of his ideas, equating it with a desrire to suppress them.  However, scientific progress is not made by scientists blindly jumping on the bandwagon of any new idea that comes along.  Instead it comes from kicking the tires and trying to tear the ideas apart and seeing what happens.  Ideas that cannot withstand strong scrutiny are quickly dismissed, and with good reason.  However, sometimes the creator of the theory can address those criticisms and over time build a stronger edifice on the foundations of the initially dismissed idea.  It is the interative reworking of ideas in the face of justified criticism that creates scientific progress.  That is how string theory came to be accepted as a possibility:  It's advocates worked for years to build the theory and eventually demonstrated (much to people's surprise) an underlying self-consistency.  This is in accord with another of Imre Lakatos's comments:

: "''Scientists have thick skins. They do not abandon a theory merely because facts contradict it. ... What really count are dramatic, unexpected, stunning predictions: a few of them are enough to tilt the balance ...''".

I see nothing dramatic in the predictions of this theory.  If anything, it demands a regression to older, abandoned concepts:  that gravitation is due to a force of gravity, that Big Bang was an explosion in space instead of being an explosion of space, etc.  SR predicted the Fizeau effect and the inability to [[accelerate]] [[electron]]s beyond ''c''.  GR predicted the observed perihelion precession of Mercury and the bending of starlight near the Sun.  Where is anything at all similar here?

There isn't.  However, more important than that is this:  This is Wikipedia, and Nigel's work very much is original research, and will be so until and unless he can get it published in a [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal]].  If it then becomes referenced and built on by others, then we will have a progressing reasearch program which is built on these ideas.  At that point, there will be reason to document that program in Wikipedia, and I assume that someone else will gladly do so.  

(Perhaps this should be an explicit rule here in Wikipedia:  You never document your own work here nor ask another to do so, but may critique and edit the independently created attempts of others to do so.) --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 30 June 2005 19:49 (UTC)

To EMS: thank you for quoting my source Lakatos.  Please notice that in the first place people have to document their own studies.  For example, Newton claimed to work out the inverse square law in 1665 or so, and published it in 1687.  It appears that he was happy to keep others in ignorance until Hooke came up with the same idea (less proof), when Newton became keen to assert priority.  Similarly, Darwin kept his work under wraps for twenty years, until Wallace came up with similar arguments and submitted them for publication.  It is not a sin to document old work.  As I keep pointing out, although it is presently being suppressed by the string lobby - relying in Witten's 1997 article in Physics Today which claimed strings predict gravity - to deny it means disproving Hubble's law or Newton's laws, and evidence supports them.

If it is a sin to document your own work, then everyone who writes on the basis of their authority is a sinner.

Major results

The inverse-square law of gravity which formerly had to be derived empirically by Newton’s method using Kepler’s observed laws of planetary motion (hence no understanding), plus uniquely the correct universal gravitational constant G, accurate to within 1.65% for Physical Review Letters reported data, i.e., a prediction of 10 ms-2 at the earth’s surface compared to a measured 9.8 ms-2. Newton never estimated this constant, it was later worked out by Laplace by fiddling the equation to fit observations, not by a proof based on the mechanism of gravitation. This is completely unique. 

There is little ‘dark matter’ around because the false ‘critical density’ in general relativity is out by a factor e^3/2 = 10. 
 
The falsity of the ‘acceleration’ of the universe implied from supernovae red-shift (since gravity is a response to the surrounding matter, distant galaxies in the explosion are not slowed down by gravity, so there is no need to claim there is an acceleration offsetting a fictitious gravity pull-back). This was predicted via Electronics World 1996, before discovery of the ‘acceleration’ confirmed it. Nature’s editor said he was ‘unable’ to publish. 
 
The smoothness of the ripples in the cosmic background radiation (gravity and electromagnetism forces, Electronics World April 2003, increase in direct proportion to age of universe but this does not vary the sun’s brightness as you might think because each variation offsets each other; fusion rate depends both on electric repulsion between protons and gravitational compression). (See http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/ for proper symbols in the equations that follow.) Since G = (3/4) H2/( p r local e3 ) = 0.0119H2/r local , G is proportional to H2/r . H varies with the age of the universe as 1/t, while r is mass divided by volume so it varies as the inverse cube of radius and (with light speed expansion of the observable radius), inverse cube of time. G thus varies as (1/t)2/(1/t3) = t, so G gets bigger in direct proportion to the age of the universe. Since the mechanism for electromagnetism is linked to gravity by the drunkard’s statistical walk of energy between similar charges in the universe, the forces vary in the same way and no observable effects of this have been predicted to date despite ongoing efforts.

Best wishes again, Nigel

Interesting.  The varying ''G'' is also predicted by the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]].  You may wish to research that.

I wish you well with your project.  I do not think that you are right, but I am not interested in seeing anything worthwhile suppressed either.  However, please realize that even if it is right, a 4-page write-up like yours is not suitable for pulication in a journal like Nature.  In GR, if one assumes that the universe is 5% visible matter/energy, 25% dark matter, and 70% dark energy, then the observed charactersitics are obtained from a solution of the [[Einstein field equations]].  So is this proof that dark energy exists, or is the need for dark energy a proof that GR is not right?  You can choose the later, as you have done.  But in that case, you need an alternative to GR (as both of us have), and then need to describe how it differs from GR and how it still conforms to observation in the known cases.  After all, GR is the existing theory and is compatible with observation, including in ways that other theories are not.

You need to realize that the burdens both of proff and of presentation are on your shoulders.  You have a lot of work ahead of you, and of an amount that can only be appreciated in hindsight.  You also need to come to grips with the fact that what is suppressing your views is not the opposition of string theorists but instead your blaming them for your failure to so far produce a genuine scolarly article on this subject.

So please stop trying to sneak you ideas in through the "back door" (which for an idea like this is what Wikipedia is).  If it is worthy, it deserves a can obtain better than that.  It it is not, then it does not belong here either.

So my best wishes to you too,  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 5 July 2005 04:38 (UTC).



Hello again Ems57:

This is not personal or original research, peer-reviewed articles were published as cited in Electronics World.  A lot of further advances have occurred and are documented over the years, as the result of many people, in Electronics World.  Physical Review Letters editor for comparison:

Sent: 02/01/03 17:47
Subject: Your_manuscript LZ8276 Cook
MECHANISM OF GRAVITY: 
Physical Review Letters does not, in general, publish papers on alternatives to currently accepted theories… Yours sincerely, Stanley G. Brown, Editor, Physical Review Letters

(Other responses are here: http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/ScienceWorld.htm )

Now, why has this nice genuine guy still not published his personally endorsed proof of what is a ‘currently accepted’ prediction for the strength of gravity? Will he ever do so?  Dr Brown is a nice person, but he has a difficult job.  He can't have peer-reviewed anything but stringy stuff, as that is the flavour of the day.  There is no point pestering him regardless of the type of article, style, or length.  That is not the issue.  If it were, I would get that sorted out at the request of the reviewers.  The whole discovery is contrary to string speculation, and falls foul for that reason, not any other reason.  It is not being rejected by Brown for a comma out of place or the long list of confirmed predictions it makes in gravitation and cosmology, and for resolving existing problems.  It is being suppressed politically, as per the "alternatives to currently accepted theories" (HINT: STRING THEORY).  Thank you.

You will also notice that Electronics World published two major papers, the first of 4 pages and the second of 6 pages, plus a large number of subsequent letters.  The material on the internet is extensive.

On page 896 of his book Road to Reality, Roger Penrose analyses those who use string ‘theory’ as an obfuscation of gravity’s cause:

‘In the words of Edward Witten [E. Witten, ‘Reflections on the Fate of Spacetime’, Phys. Today, April 1996]:

   "String theory has the remarkable property of predicting gravity,"

‘and Witten has further commented:

   "the fact that gravity is a consequence of string theory is one of the greatest theoretical insights ever."

‘It should be emphasised, however, that in addition to the dimensionality issue, the string theory approach is (so far, in almost all respects) restricted to being merely a perturbation theory …’

String ‘theory’ has no proof of a physical mechanism and predicts not even the inverse square law, let alone the strength of gravity! (In apt words of exclusion-principle proposer Wolfgang Pauli, string ‘theory’ is in the class of belief junk, ‘not even wrong’.) 

The major drive behind my work on this subject stems from suppression of the error in electronics calculations of computer crosstalk, which is due to transverse electromagnetic waves in the fabric of space.  There have been problems in Maxwell's model of light ever since it was proposed, if you look at Fig. 67 in article 791, page 439 in Maxwell's "Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism" you see the classical illustration of light as electric field and magnetic field as sine waves in perpendicular directions.  This has long been exposed in Wireless/Electronics World as contrary to the following facts: Maxwell's model claims that varying one field causes the other, but he illustrates them conveniently as in phase, also the peak fields are always the same.  Hertz' experiments, claimed to prove Maxwell's model, ignored the fact that the peak field falls inversely with distance from the transmitter aerial for radio.  We know for light that photons don't lose energy by spreading out with distance.  Hence, the mechanism for radio waves is entirely different to light.  Radio waves are propagating variations in the electric field strength around an aerial, not quantum packets.

If, you check my writings, you will see that I dismiss speculation: Dirac had no mechanism for his large numbers hypothesis.  In addition it makes predictions about the sun's radiating power which appear to conflict with the evidence from geology, the fossil record, since the sun's radiating power is very sensitive to gravity constant G.  Dirac at least in his major 1970s papers suggested that gravity is falling in strength, not rising in strength.  There is no accord between the mechanism of gravitation based on facts and the speculations of Dirac, Eddington, or others.

If you look at my internet page, referenced above, you will see that many people have been killed due to the insistence of some "experts", ignorant of the real physics, on "correct" approaches.  These "experts" behave like dictators, ridiculing life saving inventions (see www.ivorcatt.com for my Jan 03 Electronics World article on this).  I hope you can see that the motivation here is constructive, and that the destructive approach is due to those who object.

Best wishes again,
Nigel

Nigel, please do not add those links. They do not help anybody reading this article. The current discussion has not ended in a way that you could go ahead with this. [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 8 July 2005 00:06 (UTC)

Hello Awolf,

Could I temporarily include the link here: http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=215

Peter Woit, a Columbia University mathematician (see
http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/; he runs ‘Not Even Wrong’ about string theory – physicist Pauli deemed speculative belief systems like strings which predict nothing and cannot be tested or checked ‘not even wrong’).  He helped Davidson write the skeptical San Francisco Chronicle newspaper article (http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/):

March 14 2005: Today's San Francisco Chronicle contains an article about string theory entitled "Theory of Everything" Tying Researchers Up In Knots. The lead sentence is (http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/03/14/MNGRMBOURE1.DTL ):

‘The most celebrated theory in modern physics faces increasing attacks from skeptics who fear it has lured a generation of researchers down an intellectual dead end.’

Davidson contrasts Michio Kaku's very pro-string theory point of view in his new book Parallel Worlds, with the much more skeptical views of Lawrence Krauss, who has a book entitled "Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions" coming out in September 2005.

Stanford's Robert Laughlin makes the point that string theorists are trying to camouflage the theory's increasingly obvious flaws by comparing the theory to ‘a 50-year-old woman wearing way too much lipstick.’

Best wishes to you, Nigel

: Nigel, I can't really see how a reader of this article is helped by this link. It might be an "interesting discussion" for some, but not for the majority of people, I think. It just does not fit into the scope of this article in my oppinion. If you want to initiate some discussion about "string theory" that also would not fit in here. AFAIK for now is that the current state of what you advocate in relation to gravity is original research and is not (yet?) ready to be included here.

Nigel -

As far as I am concerned, the book is closed.  There is no further reason to discuss your ideas here.

It is time to return to the real issue at hand:  Your work, and references to it, do not belong here.  Period.  If this means that we are aligning ourselves with the nasty theory-eating string theorists in your eyes then so be it.  Myself and others will revert each and every edit of yours, and keep on doing so until you quit. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 8 July 2005 04:22 (UTC)

EMS - Above I listed statements from mainstream physicists, Newton to Einstein and beyond, on the physical fabric of space.  I also pointed out that this is not my work, it is other people's.  Nothing on it is original.  All of the "reasons" you give for not allowing Wikipedia to distribute peer-reviewed and published information are your personal opinions, unsubstantiated by any facts at all, and indeed contrary to the facts.  While Wikipedia does not allow unpublished facts, it also does not allow unpublished personal opinions.  I hope therefore that you will stop threatening to vandalise other people's contributions.  Please realise that this Wikipedia is about information and spreading it.

Thank you in expectation of your cooperation!  Best wishes, Nigel

If you truly think that what myself and others are doing is [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]], then feel free to report it as such. Do kindly reference this thread when you do so, <s>and be aware that you may be the one who is ruled to be the vandal</s>.  However, since both sides here are acting in good faith, it seems that under Wikipedia's rules there is no vandalism going on here.  So I advise using the [[Wikipedia:dispute resolution|Wikipedia dispute resolution process]] if you think that you are in the right here.

For their sake the administrators, I will summarize my case against your work here:
# Although built on established observations and facts, the intepretation that you give them and the model that you build on that interpretation are highly speculative.  For that reason, this is [[original research]].
# One of the statements that you make in support of your views, that [[general relativity]] cannot describe a [[universe]] with an accelerating expansion, is just plain false.
# One of the predictions of your model, that the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' varies over time, has been predicted before and is incompatible with the observed variations in the [[cosmic background radiation]].
# Your work has not been either published or referenced in a relevant peer-reviewed journal such as Nature, Science, or Physical Review (amongst others).
#* As best I can tell, this work has not even been peer reviewed in such a journal, in spite of its having been submitted to them.
#* While your views have been published in Electronic World, an electronics magazine is not a journal peer reviewed by scientists trained in the fields of gravitation and cosmology.
# Perhaps most importantly, I know of noone else, much less any respected scientsts, who would endorse these views.
#* This disqualifies it under the [[NPOV]] which states that "if a viewpoint is held by a extemely small ... minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia ..., regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not". 

Since we both are independent researchers, I will happily lay off if an adminstator/sysop tells me to do so.  I wish you luck, but don't expect you to have any.  I therefore offer you my apologies for not cooperating, but (as I understand it) Wikipedia is about ''documenting'' existing knowledge instead of dissemenating new knowledge.  The job of dissemenating new knowledge is left to the peer reviewed journals that you assume you cannot be published in. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 8 July 2005 18:32 (UTC)

P.S.  You really should look at the history of the article itself by going back to the article and then clicking on the "history" tab.  (Be aware that clicking on the history tab while reading this talk page will give you the history of the talk page instead of the history of the article.)  Of all the times that you have been reverted, I have been the one who did it only once or twice.  You are not fighting me.  Instead you are fighting (or trying to fight) an entire community.  What I have been doing here is
# trying to reason with you, and
# acting as an advocate for the Wikipedia community.
When I wrote above that "myself and others" will revert you, I was not asking others to do so.  Instead I was acting with the expectation this this would in fact continue to happen, and indeed it is happening.  Noone here knows or supports your views, or has any reason to support their presense here.  Without the support of others, your edits will have no staying power, even if I should choose to lay off.  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 8 July 2005 22:25 (UTC)

Hello EMS;

All of the statements above from you are false: http://members.lycos.co.uk/nigelbryancook/ shows where you are wrong.

You state :

"# Although built on established observations and facts, the intepretation that you give them and the model that you build on that interpretation are highly speculative.  For that reason, this is [[original research]].
# One of the statements that you make in support of your views, that [[general relativity]] cannot describe a [[universe]] with an accelerating expansion, is just plain false.
# One of the predictions of your model, that the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' varies over time, has been predicted before and is incompatible with the observed variations in the [[cosmic background radiation]].
# Your work has not been either published or referenced in a relevant peer-reviewed journal such as Nature, Science, or Physical Review (amongst others).
#* As best I can tell, this work has not even been peer reviewed in such a journal, in spite of its having been submitted to them.

1. The interpretation is not "highly speculative" as it REJECTS SPECULATION.

2. I make no statement of "that [[general relativity]] cannot describe a [[universe]] with an accelerating expansion, "

3. "''G'' varies over time, has been predicted before and is incompatible with the observed variations in the [[cosmic background radiation]]."  IS TOTALLY FALSE as my webpage shows: Dirac got it wrong.  I've told you this before.  Please don't insult everyone by repeating it.

4. It was peer-reviewed in Electronics World, which also first published Arthur C. Clark's article on  satellites in 1945.  Before you start throwing insults at the people who peer-review and publish work for the first time, I suggest you remind yourself we are dealing with weeding error out of a community of physicists, not innovating.  So don't insult me again please.

5. There are grave errors in general relativity stemming from an ignorance of electronics, as I have pointed out before to you, viz the physical properties of space already explained.

6. The fact that you admit to ignorance about who would endorse these views says an awful lot more about your suitability to evaluate contributions to Wikipedia.  Your own admitted ignorance does not discredit anybody but yourself.  Please stop insulting yourself, therefore, and wasting the time of others.  The editor of the book "Pushing Gravity" has endorsed it

Dear Nigel,

Thanks for your interesting e-mail. I have had a look at the website you mentioned and found the mechanism you propose there quite novel. …

In fact, yours is the first paper I'm aware of that ties a Le Sage mechanism of gravity explicitly to expansion of the universe …

I hope that yopu will see fit to stop being so abusive to users of Wikipedia in future.

Dear Nigel,

Since you stated above that I endorsed your theory, I have no choice but to reply.  I did not endorse it.  I merely noted that there were some mathematical similarities between your model and something I was working on (which did not appear in the book).  Your model is premised on the Big Bang model.  As I made clear in the full text of my letter to you, I do not subscribe to the Big Bang.  I support a model featuring a universe in perpetual equilibrium, in the manner of Jaakkola's work.  Please be more careful about quoting others.

Best wishes,
Matt Edwards


Dear Matt Edwards,

I read your email and you apparently endorsed the mathematical similarities between the mechanism's prediction of my model, and the measured experimental gravity laws of Newton and Einstein, the newtonian law and the general relativity contraction mechanism.  Either you want science or not.  Ivor Catt has also done this, muddling the water.  If you understand what science is about you know it rests on facts.  If you don't subscribe to the big bang model, you need a replacement model which has at least as much testable evidence for it.  It really is sickening that the few people who understand LeSage mechanism chicken out of the science of the big bang.  Do you subscribe to evolution, or is it just the big bang which your personal feelings don't tag along with?  Please be reasonable here.  I'm talking about predictions confirmed by experimental measurements, this is the scientific criterion, not prejudice.

Best wishes,
Nigel Cook

:‘Children lose interest … because a natural interest in the world around them has been replaced by an unnatural acceptance of the soundness of certain views, the correctness of particular opinions and the validity of specific claims.’ – David Lewis, You can teach your child intelligence, Book Club Associates, London, 1982, p. 258.

:The problems of speculation in physics about non-causual (purely mathematical) guesswork are discussed at http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/ for example http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=230 where Peter Woit of Columbia University says: 'the danger is that there may be lots of ways of “quantizing gravity”, and with no connection to experiment you could never choose amongst them. String theory became so popular partly because it held out hope for being able to put the standard model and gravity into the same structure. But there’s no reason to believe it’s the only way of doing that, and people should be trying different things in order to come up with some new ideas.'

:Gravity is a prime example of the need for causality since all purely speculative attempts at finding predictive equations for quantum gravity have failed. Causality is discussed at http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search.py?recid=706468&ln=en and in more detail at http://nigelcook0.tripod.com/

:It is unacceptable for a few to suppress proved developments giving false reasons for doing so.  There is always a need on the part of some to dismiss approaches which they are ignorant of for false reasons, for example stating that they have not been properly peer-reviewed or published when they have been, and stating that they should not be included in an encyclopedia simply because they are not already in it.  This sort of argument is circular.  Another suppression is by the false statement that facts used to prove correct results are speculative.  When the three facts are in fact well accepted, this is a false statement. (edit by [[User:217.137.87.10]], Nigel)

To Ems: your statements about the moon being made from green cheese just show how ignorant you are of mechanism, unlike questionable associations based on facts.  The facts are widely accepted, I am not proposing them, they are already well known, and the proof deals with the mechanism in detail.  There is no mechanism in arriving in associating the moon with green cheese, so it shows that you don't know what you are talking about.  Everything you have ever said has been false statements made to suppress the freedom of people to learn.  You support ignorance, and that alone is what I object to.  It is inexcusable for you to continue deleting references to mechanistic proof.  For example, Einstein and many others supported a mechanistic view of the fabric of space in producing gravity.  It is not my personal idea, all I'm doing is trying to get knowledge spread more widely.  I give credit to who it is due, which is to other people:

‘… the source of the gravitational field can be taken to be a perfect fluid…. A fluid is a continuum that ‘flows’... A perfect fluid is defined as one in which all antislipping forces are zero, and the only force between neighboring fluid elements is pressure.’ – Bernard Schutz, ‘General Relativity’, Cambridge University Press, 1986, pp. 89-90.

‘It was proposed that a mechanism of gravity should be developed to rigorously test all of the consequences of the physical fluid model for the fabric of space… The success of this model for gravity has implications for the unification of fundamental forces via quantum theory.’ – Nigel Cook, Solution to a problem with general relativity, CERN Document Server paper preprint EXT-2004-007.

Fact 1: big bang is observed as receding galaxies, with speed increasing directly in proportion to the time past that we are seeing, so increasing speed/time = acceleration in the observable space-time (if you go faster with distance in your car, you are accelerating, the acceleration being the increase in speed divided by the time interval taken)

Fact 2: by Newton’s 2nd experimentally based law (F=ma), this outward acceleration multiplied by the mass of the receding galaxies is the effective outward force of big bang explosion, 7 x 1043 N (acceleration implies a force)

Fact 3: by Newton’s 3rd experimentally based law, every force has an equal and opposite reactive force: so there is equal inward force caused by the fabric of space (like an implosion type nuclear weapon in which half the total force of TNT initially goes inward)

In quantum gravity, the big error in physics is that Hubble in 1929 divided the recession speeds by the apparent distances to get his constant, v/R = H. In fact the distances increase while the light is coming back to us. What he should have done is to represent it as a variation in speed with time past. Whereas H has units s-1 (1/age of universe), the directly observed Hubble ratio is equal to v/t = HR/(1/H) = RH2 (and therefore has units of ms-2, acceleration). In the big bang, the recession velocities from here outward vary from v = 0 towards v = c, and the corresponding times after the big bang vary from 15,000 million years (t = 1/H) towards zero time. Hence, the apparent acceleration as seen in space-time is

a = (variation in velocity)/(variation in time) = c / (1/H) = cH = 6 x 10-10 ms-2.

Although a small acceleration, a large mass of the universe is involved so the outward force (F = ma) is very large. The inward Higgs field pressure gives the right value for G, disproving the ‘critical density’ formula of general relativity by ½ e3 = 10 times. This disproves most speculative ‘dark matter’. Since gravity is the inward push caused by the Higgs field flowing around the moving fundamental particles to fill in the void left in their wake, there will only be a gravitational ‘pull’ (push) where there is a surrounding expansion. Where there is no surrounding expansion there is no gravitational retardation to slow matter down. This is in agreement with observations that there is no slowing down (a fictitious acceleration is usually postulated to explain the lack of slowing down of supernovae).

The big bang causes an outward force (Newton’s 2nd law) that results in an equal inward force (Newton’s 3rd law) which causes gravity as an inward force, Higgs field pressure. Where partially shielded by mass, the inward pressure causes gravity. Apples are pushed downwards towards the earth, a space shield.

This inward force is carried by the fabric of space around matter (Higgs bosons in the standard model), so the inward pressure (force / area) goes as the inverse-square law, causing gravitation and predicting correct G. Current teaching of general relativity, as causing a flat surface like a rubber sheet to curve into a manifold, is unhelpful to further progress in unifying quantum space with gravitation, since physical space fills volume, not surface area.

The Higgs boson explains inertial mass, which by Einstein’s equivalence principle is the same as gravitational mass. Feynman seemed to discuss this vaguely in ‘Character of Physical Law’ 1965 BBC lectures, with a diagram showing that if there is a pressure in space masses will be pushed together by mutual shielding. He elsewhere noted that the contraction effect in general relativity compresses the earth’s radius by (1/3)GM/c2 = 1.5 mm. (By the same pressure effect for inertial mass in motion, you get the FitzGerald contraction in the direction of motion, explaining the Michelson-Morley result; see discussion of general relativity below.) The gravitational contraction is radial only, not affecting the circumference, so there a difference between the true radius and that calculated by Euclidean geometry. Thus curved space using non-Euclidean geometry, or you can seek the physical basis of the pressure in the surrounding universe. If you have a big bang with speeds increasing in spacetime (v = dR/dt = RH, where H is Hubble constant) that means acceleration of a = dv/dt = [d(RH)]/[dR/(RH)] = RH2, so there is outward force F = ma due to the big bang around a mass, which means equal and opposite reaction (inward force divided by area is the Higg’s field pressure, F/A = P). The drag effect that worried Feynman is simply the increase in mass that occurs as speed rises.

The fact that you personally wish to keep other people in ignorance is not proof that there is no interest in science.  It certainly is not proof that the information I wish to add a link to on Wikipedia is information which is my work.  Other people, such as Einstein and Eddington, came up with the central work.

Ems: not "everything" just you, and not "my views" but the work of Einstein, Eddington, and others.  It is a shame every reason you have given for deleting a single link I whish to insert to the research of Einstein and others has been shown to be wrong.  Since you continue to invent reasons of increasing absurdity, such as analogy to the moon being made of cheese, you appear to be deliberately fabricating excuses for keeping this off the Wikipedia article.  A rational person, once the evidence is explained, would behave in a more civilised way.  Your approach has at no time been constructive on this matter.  It is no good saying that science is a personal business, or that I discovered that a fluid fabric of space is the source of gravity according to general relativity.  All I did was to popularise other people's work by adding a rigorous calculation of the gravity law and strength prediction from mechanism.  A published correct calculation is not a view or opinion.  Yours sincerely, Nigel

: You hold up [[Einstein]], [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]], and others like a [[amulet|talisman]].  That helps you little if you do not understand their work.  Example:  In [[general relativity]], [[gravitation]]al effects (including the accelerating [[Hubble expansion]]) are due to ''inertial'' motion along the time-like [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of a [[curvature|curved]] [[spacetime]].  '''No forces are involved.'''  (That is a '''''fact''''' about GR, whether you like it or not.)  That is enough to turn your logic into a bunch of green cheese.
: In fact, your using Einstein like a talisman is a red flag that something is wrong.  [[Issac Newton|Sir Issac Newton]] once said "If I have seen farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants".  Yet [[gravity]] is his own work, not that of [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]].  Similarly, this shielding theory is yours, even if it has been inspired by others.  If it could stand on it's own, you would not need to prop it up with Einstein's name.
: I have presented the above to you for your own edification, since it strikes me as unfair to you to bring up green cheese yet not explain it fully in this case.  I know that you will not accept <s>that argument</s> any of this, but at least you have seen it.  I hope that someday it will be helpful to you.
: In any case, Wikipedia cares not if you are right or wrong.  It cannot tell and it is not it's job to rule on it.  The real question is not whether your idea deserves scientific or popular consideration but whether it is getting it.  For whatever reason, it is not.  That is the bottom line, and I will now leave it at that. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:39, 12 August 2005 (UTC)


EMS: It is Einstein's, and acceleration is real, see: http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=240:

Nigel Cook Says: 

August 12th, 2005 at 2:23 pm 
‘It’s just common sense to be skeptical of people who are making grandiose and radical claims unless they’ve got some good evidence for them…’

Eddington, who verified GR in 1919 wrote in his 1920 book Space Time and Gravitation, p. 152: ‘The great stumbing-block for a philosophy which denies absolute space is the experimental detection of absolute rotation.’

The best example of Einstein’s problems was the twin’s paradox, which is resolved by absolute acceleration, requiring general relativity, not special.

It’s the popularisations of relativity, based on out of date stuff, which discredit common sense. Or else they go with one ‘interpretation’ and quote Bohr (defending Copenhagen Interpretation wavefunction collapse) saying: ‘Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.’

This means that commonsense approaches, like the simple mechanism for gravity that Feynman discussed in a 1965 BBC lecture (click my name), are not encouraged, even if they give more testable predictions than string theory, and are consistent with general relativity! 


EMS, this proves you wrong.  I need to use Newton and Einstein, we all do.  However much you rave madly about green cheese or your other paranoid fixations on snobbery and raging abuse without checking the facts (oh yes, the facts should not be in Wikipedia, because you hate Einstein) - other people disagree with you.  Can't you understand that you are just plain wrong and everyone is laughing at you?

Thanks,

Nigel Cook

<A HREF="http://feynman137.tripod.com/">The gauge boson radiation causing gravity and electromagnetism is DISPLACEMENT CURRENT.  Catt shows that Maxwell got his interpretation of this ‘displacement current’ wrong, by ignoring the time it takes light speed electricity to flow along the capacitor plates. His co-authors Drs. Walton and Davidson mathematically worked out how the transmission line theory of Heaviside can be applied to explain the charging curve of a capacitor, which is compared to reality and is a correct prediction. Catt's error follows from Heaviside’s false idea that the light speed electricity Poynting-Heaviside vector is the same as light, with the two conductors guiding the light which travels in the insulator between them. This is false, as we know electricity originates as electrons in conductors and such like, although it is true that the measured speed is that in the insulator not the wires. What is going on is plain from quantum electrodynamics, gauge bosons/photons are being exchanged via the insulator between the two conductors. This is why parallel wires carrying currents attract/repel. In addition, the radio transmitter and receiver aerial form a capacitor with air as the dielectric. The radio waves are displacement current energy, detectable just when the varying current varies the electric field across the transmitter aerial. In the same way, the displacement current flows in the capacitor only while the field in the capacitor plate is varying, due to its charging up or discharging. Maxwell's error was fiddling a theory to fit Weber's 1856 observation that 1/(root of product of permittivity and permeability) = c. This fiddle is like the application by Rayleigh of a wave equation to sound without understanding the pressure and force mechanisms involved in particulate (molecular) sound waves. Planck showed the resolution to the problem with the wave model of light by the quantum theory, while Bohr had shown that Maxwell's light theory was incompatible with the atom. Nobody corrected Maxwell's false theory, however. In reality, ‘displacement current’ is the gauge boson, causing electromagnetic and gravitational forces, and all radio and light waves. Emitted by due to the centripetal acceleration of continuous, uniformly spinning charges (fundamental particles) with no oscillation, it is undetectable radiation, but still carries pressure and force (pressure times area), causing fundamental forces.</A>

== Gravity and Energy ==
The first sentence of the article states:

"Gravity is a force of attraction thawit acts between bodies that have mass."

This is not exactly true, is it? Photons are also affected by gravity. shouldn't it be rewritten to something like:

"Gravity is a force of attraction that acts on packets of energy."

This would lead to the following equation:
:<math>F = {{E_1 E_2} \over {F_P r^2}}</math>

where,

:<math>E_1 \ </math> is an energy packet
:<math>E_2 \ </math> is another energy packet
:<math>r \ </math> is the distance between the energy packets
:<math>F_P \ </math> is the [[Planck force]]

The Planck force is given by:

<math>F_P = \frac{E_P}{l_P} = \frac{c^4}{G} </math> = 1.21027 &times; 10<sup>44</sup> N

Magicmarc: agreed but remember a photon can be represented as a particle or a wave. The only reason we say it has no mass as a model is so that it can be accepted at travelling at the speed of light.

Hi, I was wondering if gravity used any energy to attract other masses? If so then where does the energy come from? if not how does it actually attract masses together? Because all I've heard is that its the force of attraction between two or more masses.

: Newton's theory of gravity has been superseded by [[general relativity]].  Under that thoery, there is no [[force]] of gravity.  Instead, the tendency of massive objects to accelerate towards each other is called ''gravitation'', and it is due to the way that the masses [[curvature|curve]] [[spacetime]].  In the lack of a force, there is no exchange of [[energy|energy]], as is the case for [[electromagnetism]] (in which case the "source" and "sink" of the energies in the [[electrical charge]]s themselves).

: A particle called a [[graviton]] must exist as the quantum of [[gravitational radiation]].  However, the purpose of the graviton appears to be transmit information about changes in spacetime curvature instead of acting as the [[List_of_particles#Gauge_Bosons_.28integral_spin.29|gauge boson]] (or mediator of) gravitation. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 7 July 2005 14:56 (UTC)

:: The graviton should exist if modern formulations of quantum gravity are correct.  This is far from "a graviton must exist". In fact, there is very little evidence that gravity is quantized at all. Thus, I think your statement is false as stated, and definitely misleading. --[[User:Dennis Estenson II|D. Estenson II]] 12:59, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

:: To answer the original question, ''where does the energy come from?'', classically, the energy in gravity was provided by the universe when the particles were originally separated from each other by the "big bang". This is can be traced to the fact that mathematically, negative force is attraction, energy tends to decrease, and the zero-energy point between two masses occurs when they are infinitely distant from each other.
:: From the more correct view of general relativity, the energy is an illusion caused by the fact that [[spacetime]] itself is not [[euclidean space|flat]]. This follows from the idea of [[curved spacetime]] and Newton's law of [[inertia]] if extended to include a mass in a gravitational field. Since time is taken as a dimension similar to space, "motion" through ''time'' contributes to overall motion through space''time''. A particle must always follow the shortest path between two points, and it turns out the shortest path between here-now and here-one-second-from-now is a path which ''feels'' to a particle like a downward force. Since gravity distorts lengths in space and time, as "time passes", a mass "feels a force" in the direction of the source of the gravational field.  So a mass is mutually attracted by another mass because of ''inertia'' and nature of the non-flat spacetime which surrounds any mass. --[[User:Dennis Estenson II|D.

Dear EMS57,

In ignoring the gravity mechanism as verified experimentally, you should be aware of some interest in the spacetime fabric by Professor t'Hooft, sor example http://eskesthai.blogspot.com/2005/08/fifth-dimension-is-spacetime-fabric.html

The difficulty with suppressing a defensible viewpoint by simply refusing discussion (or claiming to disprove it by a bogus claim that 'logic' can prove the moon to be cheese), is that it does not stop progress from being made.  Current teaching of general relativity, as causing a flat surface like a rubber sheet to curve into a manifold, is unhelpful to further progress in unifying quantum space with gravitation, since physical space fills volume, not surface area.

Yours sincerely,
Nigel

Astronaut-physicist-programmer Dr Lunsford has proved that the simplest mathematical system which gives Maxwell’s equations and general relativity is 6 (SIX)-dimensional. Notice that he got it published in a theoretical physics journal last year but it was removed from arXiv.org, since mainstream physics uses only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 dimensions. They used to also have 26, but that is replaced by Witten’s string theory breakthrough of 1995, ‘M-theory’ in which 10 dimensional superstrings are proved to have 11-dimensional supergravity as a limit. M-theory is crackpot, Dr Peter Woit says, because it produces no testable numbers. It is defended by the establishment as it involves 6 dimensions curled up into ‘beautiful’ Calabi-Yau manifold, which Woit describes as being mathematically vulgar and ugly. The fourth dimension is necessary to explain why Pi is constant 3.14159265... in maths, because general relativity has volume reduced radially around a mass without affecting circumference, which would increase Pi if there were only 3-dimensions. The radius of the planet earth for example is reduced by (1/3)MG/c^2 in general relativity radially, with no transverse contraction of circumference, so that Pi increases slightly unless you have a 4th dimension so that the 3-dimensions we perceive are ‘distorted’: similarly, a circle (2-d) drawn on the inside of a globe (3-d) has reduced radius, since the radius is longer over the curved surface than a straight line radius. The fifth dimension comes in two ways. First the Kaluza-Klein attempt at unifying general relativity and electromagnetism, which Lunsford shows is wrong in his paper, involved a fifth dimension being added to general relativity. Second, more recent work by string theorists has led to the ‘holographic conjecture’ of t’Hooft, which states the 4-d spacetime of general relativity is a like a 2-d hologram of a 3-d underlying reality. Holography reduces the number of dimensions by 1, and the fifth dimension can be described as a spacetime fabric. By themselves, these mathematical theories have no mechanisms or predictions of a concrete testable support, which is why I’m concentrating on unifying it with my stuff based on some of Catt’s ideas, to get mechanisms and tests. (Lunsford’s 6-d work may however make some testable predictions itself, as it gives general relativity and Maxwell’s equations as approximations to a deeper mathematical system.)

‘With such a dramatic lack of experimental support, string theorists often attempt to make an aesthetic argument, professing that the theory is strikingly ‘elegant’ or ‘beautiful.’ Because there is no well-defined theory to judge, it’s hard to know what to make of these assertions, and one is reminded of another quotation from Pauli. Annoyed by Werner Heisenberg’s claims that, though lacking in some specifics, he had a wonderful unified theory (he didn't), Pauli sent letters to some of his physicist friends each containing a blank rectangle and the text, ‘This is to show the world that I can paint like Titian. Only technical details are missing.’ Because no one knows what ‘M-theory’ is, its beauty is that of Pauli's painting. Even if a consistent M-theory can be found, it may very well turn out to be something of great complexity and ugliness.’ (Dr Peter Woit, ‘Is string theory even wrong?’, American Scientist, March-April 2002, http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/18638/page/2#19239)

Predicted force strengths and all nuclear particle masses from causal mechanisms

Danny Ross Lunsford’s major paper, published in Int. J. Theor. Phys., v 43 (2004), No. 1, pp.161-177, was submitted to arXiv.org but was removed from arXiv.org by censorship apparently since it investigated a 6-dimensional spacetime which again is not exactly worshipping Witten’s 10/11 dimensional M-theory. It is however on the CERN document server at http://doc.cern.ch//archive/electronic/other/ext/ext-2003-090.pdf, and it shows the errors in the historical attempts by Kaluza, Pauli, Klein, Einstein, Mayer, Eddington and Weyl. It proceeds to the correct unification of general relativity and Maxwell’s equations, finding 4-d spacetime inadequate: ‘… We see now that we are in trouble in 4-d. The first three [dimensions] will lead to 4th order differential equations in the metric. Even if these may be differentially reduced to match up with gravitation as we know it, we cannot be satisfied with such a process, and in all likelihood there is a large excess of unphysical solutions at hand. … Only first in six dimensions can we form simple rational invariants that lead to a sensible variational principle. The volume factor now has weight 3, so the possible scalars are weight -3, and we have the possibilities [equations]. In contrast to the situation in 4-d, all of these will lead to second order equations for the g, and all are irreducible - no arbitrary factors will appear in the variation principle. We pick the first one. The others are unsuitable … It is remarkable that without ever introducing electrons, we have recovered the essential elements of electrodynamics, justifying Einstein’s famous statement …’ D.R. Lunsford shows that 6 dimensions in SO(3,3) should replace the Kaluza-Klein 5-dimensional spacetime, unifying GR and electromagnetism: ‘One striking feature of these equations ... is the absent gravitational constant - in fact the ratio of scalars in front of the energy tensor plays that role. This explains the odd role of G in general relativity and its scaling behavior. The ratio has conformal weight 1 and so G has a natural dimensionfulness that prevents it from being a proper coupling constant - so this theory explains why ordinary general relativity, even in the linear approximation and the quantum theory built on it, cannot be regularized.’

Rueda and Haisch, Physical Review A v49 p 678 (1994), suggested that the virtual radiation of electromagnetism can cause inertial mass, and in Annalen der Physik v14 p479 they do the same for gravitation in general relativity. The virtual radiation acts on fundamental particles of mass, quarks and electrons, which are always charged. It doesn’t ignore all the quarks in a neutron just because they have no net charge. A gauge boson going at light speed doesn’t discriminate between neutrons and protons, only the fundamental quarks inside them. Therefore, the background field of virtual radiation pressure besides causing inertia (and the contraction of moving objects in the direction of motion) also causes gravity (and the contraction in the direction of gravitational fields, the reduction in GR). The force strength for electromagnetism is then naturally related to gravity. Between similar charges, the electric field causing the radiation pressure adds up like a series of charged capacitors or batteries (remember, we’re talking of potential energy difference in volts, not current). In any line, there will be approximately equal numbers of both charges, so the sum will be zero. The only way it can add up is by a drunkard’s walk, where the statistics show the net charge will be the square root of the number of similar charges in the universe. Since there are 1080 charges, electromagnetism will be the square root of this, or 1040 times stronger than gravity.   ... http://nigelcook0.tripod.com/

There has been a lot of progress in the past month on this subject.

== Scalar gravity ==

The added section on scalar gravity was removed for the following reasons:
# I have not heard of this before.  So it probably is [[original research]].
#* The link [http://users.whsmithnet.co.uk/paulbird/gravbook Introduction to Scalar Gravity] is by Paul Bird, whom I suspect is the person behind this new section.  
# It is none the less a speculative theory.
#* The site treats the existing evidence for GR as being questionable, but offers no detailed alternative explanations for its successes.
#** Scalar gravity allows for no deflection of light by massive objects such as the Sun.  Other explanations are proposed, but no detailed analysis of them is done.
#** Scalar gravity allows for no non-Newtonian perihelion precession.  It is noted that there are potential Newtonian causes for the perihelion precession of Mercury.  The author is unaware that the perihelion precession of Mercury has been carefully analyzed, and the issue is an observed non-Newtonian component, as described in [[tests of general relativity]].
# There is still too much GR stuff in this article for my liking.  As this is an alternative to GR, it would be much better being mentioned the [[general relativity]] article as one of the [[General_relativity#Other_theories|other theories]].  This however assumes that it is even worth mentioning.  Also, if it is mentioned there, it '''must''' be with a one-line description.

So (as I see it) even if this anonymous poster (most likely Paul) can show that this is not his original research and is of some current or past acceptance in the field of gravitation research, it would at best rate an "honorable mention" on the GR page.  However, I will give him credit for a well-written web site, even if I cannot support this scalar gravity or its being mentioned here. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:12, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

For this reason, these pages should remain seperate. --[[User:Dennis Estenson II|D. Estenson II]] 12:53, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

::I would be more in favor of that position if the section in this article entitled "[[gravity#Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of universal gravitation]]" was not larger and more informative than the article [[Law of universal gravitation]].  As-is that article is only redundent, and would be better off being a redirect, with the link to it in the [[gravity]] article itself referencing the section lower down itself (and I am seriously considering changing that link now, btw.)

:: I for one think that we need to figure out just what these articles are supposed to be about.  My own feeing is that "gravity", being by definition the force hypthesized by Newton that causes gravitation, ought to be uniquely the focus of this article.  The only references to general relativity or quantum gravity ought to be in a "status" section wherein the change of paradigm is noted along with the fact the Newton's model continues to be used for "normal" situations since it is much simpler and more than accurate enough.  A fuller overview ought to be in an article entitled "gravitation" (which currently is a redirect to this page).  However, that should just be a broad brush overview of the field, '''briefy''' touching on Newton's theory, [[general relativity|GR]], [[quantum gravity]], and significant alternative theories. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:04, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

: 90% of the information in the first two sections, and section 11, should be moved onto its own page, like [[law of universal gravitation]].  In fact, a good deal of the total information in the article would be better suited in more specific articles.  For example, I think the only equation that [[gravity]] should have within it is F=G*m1*m2/r^2.  There may be a good argument for keeping the miscellaneous equations near the bottom, but maybe they should be moved to an article such as [[equations of falling bodies]] or something.
: I agree with you that the article, as it currently stands, seems to lack <s>any purpose</s> focus, and looks to be a hodgepodge of miscellaneous information variously related to gravity.  The article ''should'' provide an introduction to gravity, giving an overview of what gravity is and how it is used, as well as an overview of its history in science, and brief introductions with links to each of the well-developed theories of gravitation. Everything else is bloat that should be moved to more specific articles or removed altogether, IMHO. --[[User:Dennis Estenson II|D. Estenson II]] 10:09, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

:: I would be happy to see a reorganization of this material. It badly needs it.  However, I would not say that this article lacks purpose.  If anything it has too much purpose!  My complaint is that it lacks a simple, coherent focus.  It tries to do too much, and in the end does little of it well.  It also jumps back and forth, with standard material interleaved with discussions about various alternatives.  Newton's objections is near the bottom while a section on problems with Newton's theory is near the top, etc.
:: I think that the idea in your last paragraph is good one, and echoes my own call for an overview page.  I think that you should go for it.

: I don't know that I am the right person to do this. I have been contributing to wikipedia for only a little more than 1 month, and that's been primarily minor corrections of fact or grammar. Also, I am only a layman's expert on gravity, without the encyclopedic knowledge of the subject that should be required. At any rate, I think I could serve a role in the redesign but not the primary one. For example, I could provide some material from a few books written by [[Ernst Mach|Mach]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]], [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]], [[George Gamow|Gamow]], and [[Max Jammer|Jammer]] but most of the information contained within them is too sophisticated for a general gravity article.

: Gamow's ''Gravity'', at least the one I have, is not a textbook.  It is more like a 150 page handbook composed of 10 essays suitable for people at an average level of education.  I only mentioned it because the structure of the book, and the order and depth of many of the topics within it, would be suitable for this article.  I did not mean to use it as an exclusive source, abandoning everyone else's contributions, or splitting [[gravity]] into 10 articles (one per chapter), or some other such nonsense. Anyway, I am a better critic than creator, so I shouldn't be doing any major revisions to the article.
: BTW, how is [[gravitation]] so different from [[gravity]] and [[Law of universal gravitation|Newton's gravitational law]] that it might need its own article? (Notwithstanding that most of the detailed information about Newton's theory in [[gravity]] belongs in [[Law of universal gravitation|Newton's gravitational law]].) --[[User:Dennis Estenson II|D. Estenson II]] 07:17, July 28, 2005 (UTC)

== Gravity vs. Gravitation ==

To answer [[User:Dennis Estenson II|D. Estenson II]]'s question above:

''gravitation'' is the tendency of massive objects to accelerate towards each other.
 
''gravity'' is Newton's theory under which all masses exert an [[inverse-square law]] force on all other objects which is proportional to the mass of the gravitating object. 

So "gravity" specifically calls for there to be a force acting between objects while gravitation refers to the phenomenon in more general terms.  The reason for the distinction is beacuse in [[general relativity]] masses are not exerting a force on each other.  Instead, the way a gravitating mass bends spacetime causes other object (massive objects, photons, etc.) to accelerate towards it.

This is why an overview article can be written on "gravitation" with a fair part of what is in this article moved there.  What remains can then focus on Newton's theory instead of being part gravitation overview and part Newton's theory description.  BTW - This means that doing the proposed merge becomes obvious.

: This is where we disagree. Where are you getting your definitions from?  See, e.g. Merriam-Webster for more widely accepted definitions of [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=gravity gravity] & [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=gravitation gravitation]. Gravity is a much more general term than Newton's specific theoretical formulation, and so those two articles should remain separate. I do now agree, however, that gravitation could be treated more generally than gravity. --[[User:Dennis Estenson II|D. Estenson II]] 03:29, July 29, 2005 (UTC)

:: Those definitions are incorrect.  It is obvious that the editor of that dictionary had no idea what they are.  In the popular press and for most people "gravity" and "gravitation" are synonymous, and that is what those definitions reflect.  I am not concerned with that.  Instead I an concerned with how ''scientists'' in the relevant fields understand those terms.  I think that I was told of the is distinction when I started taking [[general relativity]] courses.  The books tend to assume it in their titles.  See [[general relativity resources]] to see what I mean.

First of all, for the caption that goes with picture of the astronaut in orbit:  '''Both''' the astronaut and the Earth are in freefall.  Anytime that you are weightles, you are in freefall.

Secondly, the Einstein Field Equations are solved to find the shape of spacetime in various situations.  They do not embody the Equivalence Principle, but intead assume it.  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 03:02, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

Better, but you still do not express what the Einstein field equations (EFE) are any where near correctly.  Please see [[General_relativity#The_Einstein_field_equations]] for a better description of them.

== Massive particles ==
I saw the recent edit and revert removing and replacing 'massive' and thought I'd add my two cents here rather than  muck with the opening paragraph. 

The article starts with the line:
:Gravity is the force of attraction between massive particles.
The immediate problem is that the word 'massive' carries a more common meaning that is not intended here.  Maybe the line could be re-written to end with '...betweent particles with mass.'  This does string a few prepositions together, but it's clear.  However, the whole thing is also very Newtownian in that General Relativity does not require that both objects have mass.  The end of the paragraph gets at this, but I would suggest adding 'Newtonian' or 'Classical' in the first sentence.  [[User:Jmeppley|Jmeppley]] 05:23, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Yes, we should have this discussion. I reverted, because the sentence became too general, and would have also covered electromagnetism. In the original, classical definition, Gravity is experienced by an object with mass (Newtonian force). That formula also explains the dependence of that force on  the mass of the object creating it (this is just a way to phrase it, since obviously there is a symmetry, here). In Relativity, the "force" is created by the shape of space-time, but again this shape is influenced by the mass/energy of the particle(s) and nothing else. So, we should keep "mass" in that sentence, but it would be nice to rephrase it. [[User:Awolf002|Awolf002]] 11:43, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

== aether repulsion ==

heres a little theory I just thought up, what if matter had the power, rather than of atracting matter, but of reppeling some aether like substance. in the same way that light objects float on water, would it be possible that matter is displaced by the aether being reppeled from a large object, causing it to "float"?, this does not necersarily have to be true, but it is important to take all possibilities into account when you dont know what causes something.

: You are hardly the first to think of this.  See [[LeSage gravity]]. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:52, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

I think the theory is kind of similar, however i was thinking along a different line, imagine say that gravity pushed the oppposite way, and you have an underground lake of water. then some ice blocks, being lighter, comes to the bottom of the lake since the is water is pushing upwards. Now the aether is like the water but it looks like the ice is falling so you asume that is where gravity pulls. correct me if i'm wrong, but having read the article I dont think I found anything about matter actualy acting on aether to push it away, only blocking it.

: To quote from the LeSage gravity article:
:: ''In this model the gas would normally provide a uniform force in all directions, leading to no gravity at all, except that massive objects block the motion of the gas.''
: It seems to me that even if you are saying that the aether is repelled by massive objects you are still calling for the same kind of effect:  A pressure differential such that objects are pushed inwards towards massive objects.  Of course there are issues that you need to deal with here:
:* By what means is the aehter repelled?
:* How does the aether act on massive bodies so that it can push them?  (Do be aware that the original aether was so ephemeral that is exerted minimal forces on massive objects.)
:* How is it that this force is proportional to the masses of the objects?
:I think that you have some work to so to show that this kind of force can properly model gravitation.  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:14, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

:"Objects fall on earth due to a force of attraction by the earth. therefore, the earth, the planets, constellations, the moon and the sun are held in orbit due to this attraction".
:It was not until the late 17th century in 1687, 1200 years later, that Sir Isaac Newton rediscovered the Law of Gravity.

== Vardhu7 comment moved here ==

   The formula for calculating the gravitational force
 between any two objects has been given by Newton as:-

 <math>                  
                  F=GMm/R2
                   
</math>


Here G= universal gravitational constant,
          
M= mass of first object

m= mass of second object
          
R2= square of distance between the center of masses 




But in case of two concentric rings in the same plane ,which have virtual center of masses ,

<math>R=0</math>

Hence,

F= Infinite.

Thus , it will be impossible to separate them. Any circular disc can be said to be consisting of many such concentric rings. Hence it will be impossible to break such a disc. Similarly, it can also be said be for two concentric spheres , though even after the application of the shell-theorem, we will come to controversial results.Thus, Newton’s law is controversial.

:: I think the error in this argument is "''which have virtual center of masses''," which seems to use the equivalency of the gravity field ''outside'' an extended spherical mass to a point source with the same mass.

This quotation is saying that Newton wished laws could be found like his laws of motion and gravitation that would explain all of nature. "I wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles." Obviously, he here wishes that all of nature could be explained by mechanical principles.  He was hoping for quantum mechanics, I guess.  He wants to explain why certain bodies repel and attract by mechanical principles. He wants to explain why attraction creates coherent figures i.e. it looks to me like he wants a law for why nature creates solid forms that cohere possibly hinting at atoms and the electromagnetic force. 

However, the information surrounding this quote is about causality and Newton's complaints about action at a distance.  This is the wrong quote for that and I will be removing this quote and putting in the correct Newton quote.--[[User:Voyajer|Voyajer]] 02:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

Perhaps this translation is preferable.  I leave it to the original contributor to choose:

Newton himself wrote in a letter to Dr Bentley dated 25 February 1693 (see for example [1], page 302):- 

It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and effect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate gravity to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me a great absurdity, and I believe that no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial I have left to the consideration of my reader.

==I have a problem with a statement and I am removing it==

:Similarly, when doing chin-ups, the electromagnetic interaction within the arms' muscle cells is able to overcome the force induced on the body by the entire Earth.

This is a mistaken understanding of bioelectromagnetism.  The truth is doing chin-ups is mechanically described by "work" done by the muscles using "leverage".

The electric nature of biological tissues permits the transmission of signals for information and for control and is therefore of vital importance for life. The first category includes such examples as vision, audition, and tactile sensation; in these cases a peripheral transducer (the eye, the ear, etc.) initiates afferent signals to the brain. Efferent signals originating in the brain can result in voluntary contraction of muscles to effect the movement of limbs, for example. And finally, homeostasis involves closed-loop regulation mediated, at least in part, by electric signals that affect vital physiologic functions such as heart rate, strength of cardiac contraction, humoral release, and so on. --[[User:Voyajer|Voyajer]] 03:51, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

*That's as maybe, but it's irrelevant as far as I can see. The statement is just saying that the force exerted by the muscles is due to electromagnetic interaction, isn't it? Are you saying this isn't the case? If it isn't electromagnetic then, as far as I understand it, the only other candidates are gravity, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force - none of which seems at all likely. (I didn't write the sentence BTW, just curious...)

** Chin-ups are caused by muscular contractions against bones which provide the base to which muscles attach and also the leverage required to accomplish external movement. The basic action of any muscle is contraction. A muscle fiber contains many myofibrils, which are cylinders of muscle proteins. The contractions of all muscles are triggered by electrical impulses. However, it is not the electrical impulse itself that defeats gravity, it is the contraction of the muscles.   The electrical impulses tell the muscle to contract, but the force to overcome gravity is determined by the muscles alone.  Everyone has the same electrical impulses, but not everyone is equally able to overcome the gravitational force by bench-pressing the same weight.  It is the size and strength of the muscle itself and the strength of the bones that determines whether the person will be able to overcome gravity. If the electrical impulses alone could overcome earth's gravity, then someone without muscles could walk or lift things.--[[User:Voyajer|Voyajer]] 00:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

***I think we're misunderstanding each other here. When I said that the "force exerted by the muscles is due to electromagnetic interaction" I wasn't talking about the tiny electrical nervous impulses, I was talking about the actual operation of the muscles themselves. What I mean is that, since there are only four fundamental forces known to science, the force exerted by the muscle must, in terms of fundamental physics, ultimately result from the electromagnetic force (since no other candidate seems at all likely). Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that fundamentally it is the electromagnetic force that is responsible for our muscles, bones and bodies even holding together, and for virtually all the activity that goes on within the body, including all the chemistry that actually makes the muscles contract, and so on and so forth. I am assuming that this was the point the original sentence was trying to make. If I am talking nonsense then hopefully someone will put me straight. Matt 01:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC).

== Merge Gravitation and Gravity articles ==
{{tl|merge}}
I think the article on Gravitation should be merged into the article on Gravity, for the following reasons:
*The vast majority of the Gravitation article is about the history of theories of gravity, which just overlaps and duplicates what is at Gravity.
*The only other information in the Gravitational article is:
**The definition: "Gravitation is the tendency of objects with mass to accelerate toward each other". Fair enough, but acceleration due to gravity is extensively covered in the Gravity article so why do we need a separate article to tell us this?
**The statement: "It is important to note that gravitation is not gravity. Gravitation describes a phenomenon independent of any particular cause. It is possible for gravitation to exist without a force, and according to general relativity, that is indeed the case." Maybe so, but GR is covered under Gravity, and any subtleties about the distinction between gravity and gravitation, with respect to GR or anything else, would more sensibly be included with that material rather than hived off into a separate article. (Incidentally, the Gravity article tells a different story, saying "Although the terms gravity and gravitation are used interchangeably, gravity usually refers only to the gravitational force between the earth and objects on or near it, whereas the term gravitation refers to the property of mutual attraction possessed by all bodies of matter.")
*The word "gravitation" appears throughout the "Gravity" article, most notably in the descriptions of "Newton's law of universal gravitation" and "Einstein's theory of gravitation". If "gravitation is not gravity" then what are explanations of these theories doing in the Gravity article?
Matt 21:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC).

: I am staunchly trying to keep these articles seperate.  As I see it, this article (gravity) should not mention GR except as an aside (in that it is what has superseeded gravity).  Indeed the discussion of theories other than that of Newton's theory of gravity should not be here at all.  However, part of what is needed to for someone to do the work of restricting this article to gravity proper and expanding the current "gravitation" article into coherent overview of the major theories (and classes of theories) of gravitation throughout history.  If I get the time soon, I will do the work.  For now, it is all that I can do to keep there from being backsliding in this regard. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:35, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
:: In my view most readers will prefer (and indeed expect) to find the chronology of the various theories of the causes, explanations and properties of gravity summarised in one place, rather than split over separate articles. The distinction between gravity and gravitation - which I must admit I was not even aware of prior to coming across the Gravitation article - is something that should certainly be included if it has a sound basis, and sounds like it may deserve better (or at least consistent) coverage, but I think that it should be woven into a single narrative. Of course, if individual sections become too long then, sure, split out the detail to a separate article, but leave a summary at Gravity. Matt 01:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC).

'''Comment.''' I would like to express again my preference for a single article (don't care whether it's titled gravitation or gravity) which summarises the whole field, from the ancients through to relativity and beyond, with links as necessary to expanded articles about Newton's theory, GR, or whatever other topics merit an individual article. 

If the gravity vs gravtitation issue is to be addressed I would like to see upfront a very clear explanation, accessible to the layman, of what the difference is. Most non-specialists do not, I feel, make much of a distinction, so this explanation is essential to make sense of such a split to the average reader. At one time there were two completely different explanations:

*At Gravity: "Although the terms gravity and gravitation are used interchangeably, gravity usually refers only to the gravitational force between the earth and objects on or near it, whereas the term gravitation refers to the property of mutual attraction possessed by all bodies of matter."

*At Gravitation: "It is important to note that gravitation is not gravity. Gravitation describes a phenomenon independent of any particular cause. It is possible for gravitation to exist without a force, and according to general relativity, that is indeed the case."

Based on total ignorance followed by ten minutes' research, I changed the text at "gravity" to read: "In common usage "gravity" and "gravitation" are either used interchangeably, or the distinction is sometimes made that "gravity" is specifically the attractive force of the earth, while "gravitation" is the general property of mutual attraction between bodies of matter. In technical usage, "gravitation" is the tendency of bodies to accelerate towards one another, and "gravity" is the force that some theories use to explain this acceleration." I do not know how accurate this is.

The existing explanation at Gravitation is in my view inadequate, but I do not feel confident enough to attempt to fix it. (The explanation also needs to be at the beginning, not the end). This issue needs to be better explained by someone who understands it. Matt 14:07, 29 January 2006 (UTC).

*Yes, split it.  Any wikipedia article with more than seven headings should be split.
[[User:Shoefly|Shoefly]] 03:37, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

== Gravity and accelerated motion ==

Isn't it true that gravity and accelerated motion are indistinguishable? For example, absent all other forces, a rocket accelerating (and pushing against the astronauts' feet) at 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> would have exactly the same gravitational effect on the astronauts, as the rocket being stationary on earth - with the earth pushing against it (and everything else) at 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> (same as saying that the everything is accelerating towards the earth's centre at 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>). In both cases the astronauts would weigh the same. I did not see this mentioned in the article...? [[User:Rohitbd|Rohitbd]] 14:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC)


Howcome that gravity is "a force of attraction that acts between bodies that have mass" thats just its behaves.
Scientist donnot really know what is it. "We don't really know. We can define what it is as a field of influence, because we know how it operates in the Universe. And some scientists think that it is made up of particles called gravitons which travel at the speed of light. However, if we are to be honest, we do not know what gravity "is" in any fundamental way - we only know how it behaves." - http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/shadow/questions/question30.html 
One question author (All the other scientists that had study gravity and had maked laws of it, it just explaning its "behaves" not what gravity really "is") Let see, try to answer this question-What causes an atom to attract another atom???!!!'''''
Could be mass?? Then howcame that the planet Jupiter, hasn't attract to the sun? or may be the planet Earth??
:Hello. Please sign your posts with <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>. I do agree that we have so far succeeded only in explaining what gravity does or how it behaves, but not "what it is". Every object in space attracts every other. So jupiter attracts the sun just as the sun attracts all other planets. Even human beings attract the earth - just that the mass of humans is so small compared to earth's that when a human falls towards the earth s/he gains much more momentum than the earth. As to why things are in orbit, it is because each planet is moving at just the velocity needed to keep it in orbit. Just as a satellite launched from the earth has to be moving at just (over?) the earth's escape velocity to get into an orbit and once in orbit it maintains that orbit if it maintains its speed.

:: Under the [[equivalence principle]], what [[User:Rohitbd|Rohitbd]] writes is true.  However, that is part of the foundation of [[general relativity]] in which [[gravitation]] is due to spacetime curvature instead of a real [[force]] exerted by one [[mass]]ive object on another.  There is a difference since in Newton's theory [[freefall]] is an accelerated state of motion, while in [[general relativity]] it is inertial motion.

== Gravitation is not gravity ==

I assure all that there is a serious difference between gravitation and gravity.

*[[gravity]] is a force.
*[[gravitation]] is just the tendency of object to move towards each other.
:<br>
*In [[Newtonian mechanics]] gravity is used to explain gravitation.
*In [[general relativity]], there is no force of gravity.  Instead gravitation occurs due to the effects of [[spacetime]] [[curvature]].

Becuase of this, I am rewriting some GR-related pages to describe GR as a theory in which there is [[gravitation]] without [[gravity]].  '''That is the correct semantics for it.'''  I therefore '''cannot''' have both links pointing to the same article.

This page needs to be expanded.  It, and '''not''' the gravity page, should have the parts now in the gravity page on GR and the new alternative theories.  The gravity page should be devoted exclusively to Newton's theory, with GR, quantum gravity, and the like being mentioned (and only mentioned) in a "Status" section.

It is time to distinguish between these two related yet different concepts.  It is time to straighten out the gravity page by taking advantage of it.  Maybe amongst lay people these two words are synonyms, but it is not that way amongst physicists today.  There is a difference, and it needs to be respected.

I trust that I have made my case.  --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

: I'm pleased that you use my definition of "gravitation" that I placed in Wikipedia some time ago to clarify some misunderstandings about gravitation, but I think that your effort to name "gravity" a "force" is a little bit misguided: "Force" is an ambiguous idea since there are "fundamental forces" (electromagnetic, strong, weak) and "pseudoforces" (gravitational, a.k.a. inertial). "Gravitational forces" (pseudoforces) exist in both Newtonian and Einsteinian theories, so do you call pseudoforces "gravity"? Or you call "gravity" a non existent Newtonian ''attractive gravitational force'' that about a century ago was thought to be a fundamental force of nature? But then why to give it a name if physically it does not exist at all? So I think that you propose to rename "preudoforces" as "gravity". Am I right? But they already have name: "inertial forces". So isn't it better to stick to the traditional terminology and just use "gravity" as anyone pleases? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 12:55, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:: In the semantics of GR, pseudoforces create "gravitational fields".  Gravity should be used exclusively to describes the Newtonian force of gravity.  Realize that when you assume that spacetime is flat, you need to have gravity as a fundamental force to describe and explain how massive objects attact each other.
:: As for naming something that "does not exist":  You need to step back and consider what it is that is being named.  The name is attached not to the force, but to the concept of the force.  Without the name, the concept cannot be discussed.  That gravity does not really exist (according to modern scientific opinion) is irrelevant to the existance of the concept.  By the way, without the concept of gravity, we never would have been able to come up with the concepts of general relativity eventually. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:27, 6 September 2005 (UTC)
::: OK. You've convinced me. I'm starting using this distinction. Up till now I've been using "gravitational force" for "gravity", but I like better "gravity" since it's simpler. I just wonder how many people will understand correctly my texts. So I'll try to explain how "gravity" occurs in Einstein's theory without any "force".

== Basics of gravitation ==

[as it was placed in the main article and then deleted by EMS]

This section explans in simple terms the physics of gravitation as it has been discovered by Albert Einstein in 1905 [should be 1915] and is still considered the true theory of gravitation. It explains how ''gravitational force'' is created and why it looks like ''attraction between objects''. 

The phenomenon of gravitation is the result of only two physical phenomena ''time dilation'' and ''curvature of space''. It turns out that there is nothing more needed to explain all the gravitational phenomena in the universe. Those two phenomena can be combined mathematically into one geometric phenomenon called the ''curavature of spacetime'' but since the curvature of space plays almost no role in gravitation in our solar system (ecxept subtleties of the movement of planet Mercury) we don't need even to consider the curvature of space to explain gravitational force with Einstein's theory. 

''Time dilation'' means that the time in any particular point in space runs slower than at a point far enough from any material objects. It means that presence of material objects slows down the rate of time in their vicinity. Time dilation reflects exactly the Newtonian gravitational ''potential''. We'll see later why.

The mechanism of gravitation in the real world is much less mysterious than in Newtonian theory, which many of us may still remember from the high school and which assumed the gravitational force as given by separate "law of universal gravitational attraction". This mysterious "universal gravitational attraction" is the main mystery of Newtonian physics. Einstein eliminated it from physics simplifying physics this way.

In the real world gravity occurs because each physical object contains in itself certain amount of energy and this energy changes with position of the object in space. This amount of energy is expressed by a well known Einstein's equation <math>E=mc^2</math>. To calculate gravitational force from this energy one needs to know how much this energy changes when the object containing this energy  moves "up" or "down". Direction of the force pushing any object is in the direction of diminishing energy of this object. In free fall in vacuum the object losing this energy is gaining equal amount of kinetic energy since the [[principle of conservation of energy]] has to be satisfied exactly and no forces act in vacuum on free falling objects.

The ''force'' (as known from high school physics) is the ratio of the change of energy <math>(dE)</math> to the change of position <math>(dx)</math>. So the gravitational force is <math>F=dE/dx</math>. We have to find only the value of <math>dE/dx</math> to derive gravitational force in Einstein's theory. For energy given by Einstein's equation it is (as known from high school math) <math>dE/dx=(dm/dx)c^2+2mc(dc/dx)</math>. If the object is at rest <math>dm=0</math>. 

As Einstein demonstrated with his [[equivalence principle]] and what has been confirmed with experiments <math>dc/dx=GM/(2cr^2)</math>, where G is Newtonian gravitational constant, M is the mass that causes time dilation in its vicinity, which in turn causes change in speed of light, and r is the distance from the center of mass M to the point in which time dilation is measured. It changes the equation for gravitational force into well known <math>F=GMm/r^2</math>, which shows that gravitational force looks as if bodies of mass M and m "attracted each other". In rality it is a force that mass m pushes itself toward mass M with because of the time dilation that mass M creates around itself and causes <math>dc/dx</math> in the equation for gravitational force. 

So the gravitational force is exactly as it has been guessed by Newton about 300 years ago. For Newton it was a guess and Einstein demonstrated that it has to be so because of the phenomenon of time dilation. Since the just derived force that is caused purely by time dilation, which is an observational fact, looks identical to Newtonian force and we can have only one force (since otherwise all the object would weigh twice as much as they do) we have to assume the Newtonian attractive force as non existent.

=== Comment ===

All that I have to say is that this is totally inadequate.  I see no good reason to get more specific than that. 

:A good reason to get more specific might be to show readers what is inadequate. 

:Remember that my text is directed to lay people with only high school education who know just simple calculus, which luckily, together with some imagination is enough to '''understand''' Einstein's physics. Of course you could also present your version of explanation if you know more adequate explanation. I think that there is no better expalanation but I might be wrong.

:: If your understanding of GR is complete then I would hate to see an incomplete one.  In the second paragraph aboove expressing your "understanding" of GR you poo-poo the concept of ''curvature of spacetime'' (which is central to GR), and after that rapidly move farther and father away from what GR is about.  

:::Dear EMS, You're playing some kind of an expert on GR and yet you consieder the concept of ''curvature of spacetime'' being ''central to GR''. Apparently you don't know that "curvature of spacetime" is just a way of simplifying the math and as such can't tell anything about physics. Consequently can't be ''central to GR'' (which is physics, to be sure, not just a mathematical model, as some scientific writers imagine). 

:::If you are so much interested in gravitation you might want to produce some popularization of GR if you have the time to argue how not to write popular atricles on GR. You might start your article with explanaing what most lay people don't know: (i) how gravitational force is generated in Einstein's gravitation, (ii) where the kinetic energy is hidden when the object moves "up" and where it comes from when it moves "down", (iii) why the universe is undergoing accelerating expansion, (iv) what ''could be'' GR reason for Pioneers to show "anomalous acceleration". It's only a few words, much less than you already used to imply that my populatisation of Einstein's gravitation doesn't fit your taste. Apparently you don't know the explanations of features of Einsteinian gravitation that I mentioned here but it is not a good reasono to envy those who know them. It would be a good reason to learn some physics and treat Einstein's theory seriously. All the answets are alredy there.

::Included are such silly statements as the assertion that time dilation gives gravitational potential an "absolute zero" at infinity which Newtonian physics lacks.

DREAM COMES TRUE


My life s dream was flying. I never stopped dreaming of it. Not simply to fly but to find the way to the another measurment system (to the another world ) like almost everybody do. Today ,thanks to God , my dream comes true. Our Father that is in Heaven gave me the way . And I am eager to give it to you, and invite you to join me in my very facinating journey to the new world (new measurment system) and you ll never regret it.


ONE MORE STATE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MATTER


I want to present my discovery about the absolutly different state of a matter (substance) to you. Arm yourself with patience to read more and more times, to go in , to understand , to accept what I m going to present to you . Because my discovery will completely change our understanding about the structure of our Universe ( our measurment system ) from top to bottom. It will give us the solution of the so called black hole phenomenon, and will give an answer to lot more natural phenomena.

As it is known we measure the space by three - dimentional measuring system. Yes the space is three dimensional , but our Universe is four - dimensional.

The space is One with no begining and with no end. and in that common area cold be existing a large number of matter (substances). one of them is our universe ( our measuring system ). An Individual unit with it s own individual life.

You know our universe is extending and we as a part of it , are exposed to some kind of mecanical influence.

To get all these clear , let s begin with the explosion hypothesis (although I am not a supporter of it ). Some part of that phenomenon will bring you closer to the understanding of my discovery and will help you to accept my ideas which I am going to present to you.

I do expect the fact that our universe (our measuring system ) is extanding from some common center (I prefer not to use the word point ) and it is eazy to prove it in practice by the help of spectrum analysis. 

Schematically the matter (substance ) of our universe has spherical form, and the matter is placed on theperiphery (outlying area)making kind of outer thin skin (shell) which is extanding periodically ( getting wider , bigger ) and is dicreasing (getting smaller ). Nowaday we are at the stage of extesion with acceleration which we get at expance of differences in innerside and outside pressurs.We can present it diagrammatically. Let s fix some time belt (t-0 ), (mark it ( the time belt) by circle )). On that time belt (circle ) mark some dots (A,B,C.D.E ) galaxies )), C - our earth, is observer .Let s draw between dot C - our earth ,and between other dots - galaxies , a straight lines (CA,CB,CD,CE ). After N time period, in accordance with spherical univers extansion, the fixed points (A,B,C,D,E )-galaxies )) are getting to the t-1 time belt. In accordance with spherical extansion passing the same distance from the relative center. The observer-our earth, will notice that the neighbouring objects (galaxies) are moving away less than those which are farther . By this very way, we can calculate our universe (our measuring system) direction to the center very exactly. I want to mantion that after certain angle of moving away(withdrawal),any such contingency to see more than 80 % of the matter of our universe may be dismissed, because of huge speeds of take away(withdrawal) from the observer. I guess(suppose) that those speeds are higher than the velocity of light. All these said above are only a part of what I want to present to you. 

Besides of moving away from each other the celestial bodies are exposed to another influence mechanical size changing in strict proportions according to the mathematical progression. untill now there was not such kind of statement, no one gave or dropped any hint of it.

Father that is in Heaven opened my eyes, opened my ears, enlarged my imagination and gave me the opportunity to see what I have seen. At first everything will seem to you nothing but bullshit, craziness, fantasy.

I don t know what about you,( what will be your reaction, your opinion), but for me it is an EVRICA .

So we are exposed to, for us unnoticable size-changing process which is going on, non stopped, continuous phenomenon. The nucleus is getting bigger at expanse of the kinetic energy which the nucleus is getting during the acceleration. 

Take a magnifying glass and look through it. you magnify the objects, things without changing their forms and contents. Like this, the whole matter is getting bigger, wider-extended. The process is continuous (is going on),every next time period the matter is more bigger,wider more extended.

The size changing phenomenon(oscillation) isn t only a process of extansion of the matter but it includes diminutival process also(lessening and narrowing) size changing process(extansion or diminutival process) is depands on in which stage of cycle(oscillation) it is placed ,if the matter is in the stage of extansion-it is getting bigger and wider(mechanically), and if it is in the stage of diminishing (decreasing) it is getting smaller and lesser (mecanically). All I said above is very eazy to prove.

During the extension process it seems to us that the bodies with bigger mass are pulling the bodies with lesser mass (we feel this way). During the diminishing process we ll feel just the contrary.

By all these I want to concentrate your attention on the fact that the Gravitation isn t anything else but the mechanical growth of the matter in mathemathical progression.The mechanical growth we are not capable to see visually, because of it s proportionality, it is all around, everywhere and all embracing.

So our universe is extending -growing-changing sizes, but visually for us the unit (substance) is unchanged - is the same, because of all embracing process of enlargment -extension.

Imagine, that we are unchangable size observers and are standing at any t-0 point of time. Then we ll be able to see the extension of the matter. By the time the matter will become transparant and will vanished from our sight.

The velocity of light is constant only relatively to his measurment system -universe,because it is also, in every next time period getting faster.

There are many other universes(measurment systems) but we are not capable to see them only for now. now we can see only our universe, because of exposure of our molecular construction to general and simultaneously going on extension.

You may ask- what about the wavy phenomena? They also are exposed to a proportional, continuous(going on) extension.

If we ll observe the wave from the fixed unmovable time point, we ll that the wave is growing in the amplitude and is lessening by frequency, and the same step distance is much longer .

MY CONCLUSION

1)So, my conclussion is that the Gravitation mostly is the pressure by the bodies larger by size on the bodies relativly smaller by size, , at expense of bigger extension of the bigger by size bodies in the space. As bigger is the body as bigger is the extension

As big is the radius of the celestial body so is the degree of it s extension.Hence all after coming consequences.

2)Our measurment system-univers, is four dimensional.One more conception like size oscillation (size changing) is added.

The verification of the degree of the extension or compression will give a huge push to our science. It will explain many natural phenomena.

I want to mention, that we are growing to the unbelivable sizes and from the certain critical point the process is just contrary. We ll get smaller, lesser untill certain sizes. And in all these processes strict proportion is observed.

nowaday our univers is in the stage of speeding up, we gettig up our speed. The matter s extensional speed as a rule is lesser, than the speed of the universe-our mesuring system, itself.

So we are in a very dynamic condition.

I hope ,I wish, that using my ideas, my statement in our scince will give us an opportunity to 

discover new universes(new measuring systems) and by time to visit them.

== Placing "Basics of Gravitation" in the main article ==

Since nobody presented any argument against my article on how Einsteinian gravitation explains gravitational force I assume that my article is acceptable as an explanation for lay people and so I placed it on the main page. I'm still asking for a critique if someone notices any deviation from the facts. Needless to say that no argument should be suported by faith only but rather by knowledge of contrmporary physics. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 23:19, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

: Having presented numerous objections above, I am '''not''' impressed by this and have reverted your edits.  More to the point:
:# This article is about gravitation in general, NOT general relativity specifically.  Kindly note that there is a [[general relativity]] article in Wikipedia already (as if that has not already been noted before).
:# It is not a correct description of general relativity.
:#:The title of the page is not "General relativity" but '''Gravitation''' where 16 year old people could go to learn why according to contemporary physics (not necessarily your ideas about it) the weight of a body is <math>F=GMm/r^2</math> (which they happen to know from their high school physics). So far you haven't provided this explanation. Do you know how is you going to do it differently than I did? I may wait util you learn how to do it but so far there is no explanation of this trivial fact in the whole Wikipedia (correct me if I'm wrong). [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 10:06, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
:#:: Your equation is Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]], and that is discussed under [[gravity]].  The connection between gravitation and [[weight]] is discussed in the article on weight, and that is where it belongs.  The issue here is much more high-level.  I will agree that this article should be accessible to an educated 16-year-old.  I will not agree that it should describe weight or go into voluminous details on any one theory.  BTW - It also would be nice if what it had to say on GR was correct.
:# The claim that we see an accelerated expansion of the universe because of [[dynamical friction]] is blatant [[original research]]. 
:#:Why do you think there is such a claim? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 10:06, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
:#:: If you are not claiming such a connection, then why bring it up in that context as the first thing that you need to study?  The implication is especially strong given that the reference to dynamic friction is the only thing in that section.  If you did not intend such an implication, you should not have left that section as you did.

: My own idea of how to expand this article (and it does need expansion I will admit) is to create one that breifly describes the various ''dominant'' views of gravitation throughout history.  These would include Aristotle's views of both planetary orbits (and later Ptolemy's model), and the Aristototlian view that the more an object weighs the faster it falls; the observations of and theories of Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, and Keppler; Newton's theory; and finally GR.  Note that each description would be brief and refer the reader to the full articles on the subject.  For the GR write-up I would tranfer to here the existing write-up in the [[gravity]] article, with the idea of having that become just an article on Newton's theory.  Finally, I would rename this article [[theories of gravitation]] (replacing the current redirect).  I think that having '''gravitation''' redirect to [[theories of gravitation]] in that case would work quite well.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 03:40, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

== Popularization of physics of gravitation ==

Dear EMS,

<!--
IMHO science should be popularized by professionals who uderstand their respecive fields. It means that gravitation should be popularized by a physicist who understands gravitation rather than Chris Hillman, who argued for years that actually he was a computer, being really not even a computer but an applied mathematician, and whom you mentioned as a the most knowledgable about GR here. I agree that he's a smart guy but to get an answer from him to anything was such a hard work that I eventually stopped trying. He was always answering a diferent question than asked. 
-->
Target of popularization are mostly young people who hope to understand all the physics. For that they don't need to know all the math describing all the physical models that exist. It's enough for them to know the reasons for physical phenomena like gravitation (''why'' things fall).

The simplest gravitational phenomenon is the "gravitational force" (the force that someone sitting on the earth feels as something he's pushing the earht with, or the earth is pushing his butt with). This force is given by an equation <math>F=GMm/r^2</math>. Explanation where this force and equation came from, step by step, IMHO should be what popularization of science of gravitation should start with. Not with history of famous people about whom young people interested in physics rather than history might not care at all. 

Of course the explanation of this force in "Newton's gravitation" is simple: he guessed it. Nobody before about 1915 seemed to understand the reasons for it. 

Einstein knew that Newton's equation was a nearly right model. He tried to guess why it was so nearly right and found the soluton in gravitational time dilation even before he discovered GR. He ''has understood'' the reasons for this equation. He was the first human who understood why things fall. What Einstein understood was ... (the stuff you deleted). Using only the concepts that lay people know about and understand (like high school mechanics and calculus) Einstein could explain why this force that is pushing a citizen's butt up has to be almost exactly <math>F=GMm/r^2</math>. And a lay person neither needs to know why is called "general relativity" nor is interested in names of models. IMHO, a lay person is motly interested in ''physics'' of the pphenomenon. How the gravitatin works. And all we actually know and can tell them about "gravitational force" is what I have written in "Basics of gravitation". 

I don't think that living the page blank becaue of your ideas what is the right way of popularizing science is doing Wikipedia any good. "Discussion" of Newton's equation in [[Gravity]] page does not explain the origin of gravitational force. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 12:21, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

: Wikipedia is for documenting human knowledge.  So unless a given speculation is well established in the literature, it does not belong in Wikipedia.  In addition, '''there is no such thing as gravitational force in [[general relativity]]'''.  Your claims to have studied GR and very much refuted by your apparent lack of awareness of this very fundamental fact about GR. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:38, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

== Importance of "dynamical friction" for understanding of "accelerating expansion of the universe" ==

Dear EMS,

It is such that when people learn about it they start imediately assuming that therefore it might be the reason for observing Hubble redshift while it can't be the reason because of certain properties of Einsteinian gravitation. But those people don't know Einsteinian gravitation yet and so they come up with idea of "tired light effect" and stop thinking. And later it is extermely difficult to convince them that they are wrong. So to know why one has to consider the issu of "accelerating expansion" separately from "tired light" one has to understand why it can't be "tired light effect" and so one has to understand what "dynamical friction" is. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 12:21, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:# With a topic like this, you either should write on it or not.  (Do remember that you can draft an article of section in your user space.  You don't need to keep half-editted text in the article itself.)
:# The expansion of the universe is not technically a case of gravitation.  If anything it is anti-gravitation!  It therefore should not be covered here, but instead in the [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]] pages, where in fact it is already covered.
:--[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:44, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
::''Anti-gravitation''? So you think that physicists made a mistake combining ''attractive'' and ''repulsive'' electricity? There is actually ''electricity'' and ''anti-electricity'' plus dumb physicists who haven't noticed that the sense of ''the force'' makes a fundamental difference not to mention even the magnetic forces calling for the third kind of electricity, perhaps ''perpendicular'' one? Luckily we have also a ''"perpendicular gravitation"'', already with a name: ''"dragging of inertial frames"''. Do you seriously think that it is not technically a case of gravitation? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 07:41, 5 December 2005 (UTC)
::: You keep falling into the trap of treating [[general relativity]] (GR) as gravitation.  You are not the first and are not the last to do so.  However, ''gravitation'' is a specific phenomenon, while general relativity is just one of several theorized explanations of it.  What I want this article to eventually do is to cover in a quick but comprehensive fashion the history of theorizing about gravitation from Aristotle on down.  Maybe I will just hunker down and do that soon.  In any case, the expansion of the universe and gravitomagnetism (as ''"perpendicular gravitation"'' is properly called) are GR-predicted phenomena, and while they are related to gravitation, they are not gravitation itself.
::: The thing that bugs me most about your proposed edits is that you want to change this article into a discussion of GR.  As I noted above, there already is a [[general relativity|general relativity article]], and one which is mostly of my own handiwork.  So if I thought of this page's subject as being primarily about GR, then I would happily change this page into a redirect to the GR article. I haven't.  I will not.  And I will revert anyone else's attempt to do so.  Note however, that I am happy to have in this article a short presentation on GR with a link the GR article itself.  However, equal treatment needs to be given to the other models of gravitation here.  I hope that this clarified things. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:14, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== "Massive" ==

Just thought I'd mention this but it might be misleading to the unexperienced in physics to say "gravity is the tendency of massive objects to attract one another" since people may think massive is in relation to size and not in relation to containing mass/matter.  So it might be better to change the text to "gravity is the tendency fo objects which contain mass to attract one another".  I know it might be kinda nit picky but there are probably a lot of people who would not initially think of the term massive as having mass.

Hope this helps, I'm new at this so I'm still trying to get a hang of things and so just wanted to point it out.--[[User:Kaworuchaos|Kaworuchaos]] 04:51, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

:You're exactly right about "massive" but the main problem here is the general lack of understanding of gravitation among physicists. Even Einstein said that he stopped understanding his own theory when mathematicians started to explain it. So now we have too many opinions on how gravitation should be popularized. It seems that no agreement on it can be reached and opinions of people with more time on their hands prevail. They always have time to remove your correction of their silly statements. 

:BTW, it is also incorrect to say "attract one another" since the "attraction" is only an illusion. It should be rather "to move towards each other" since this is the only physical reality here, but then people who still believe in "gravitational attraction" put "attraction" back to suggest that "maybe Einstein's theory is not the final word" and "we need '''quantum gravitation''' to explain the '''force of attraction'''". And then comes a mathematician and says "there is no gravitational force in GR" so apparently the force pressing your butt while you're sitting on the earth is an illusion. You aren't supposed to feel anything. But of course mathematicians are not obliged to know any physics and "force" is a physical idea not a geometrical one (which they would understand if it were). So it is rather hopeless enterprise to try to educate people on gravitation. Most of them (all the mathematicians) don't understand Einstein's theory and still hasn't noticed that in GR the universe can't expand (because of violation of conservation of energy, about which they say it's "OK in GR") and so the whole "expansion" is the same illusion as "attraction" and the same easily explainable (to a physicist at least). But how are you going to convince people that their illusions are not reality if they refuse any rational approach and many of them still believe in supernatural calling themselves "physicists" at the same time? If some of them still believe that planets are actually pushed by the angels since ''it can't be imagined otherwise''? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 06:55, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Please stop -- this really does need to be a redirect, for obvious reasons. ==

Oh, please. There is a very easy, very simple solution to all this. If there is a need to define the terms "gravitation" and "gravity" and to explain how these terms differ, then this should be done in the article "gravity".

If one has two articles, one called "gravity" and the other called "gravitation", then we will have high-school students trying to add newton and einstien to this article, because they think they're "filling it out with the facts". Which means that someone will have to patrol this article from now until infinity, reverting every silly edit made.  I don't know about you, but I've had about enough of patrolling silly edits.  It would be much easier to just watch one article, than watching and explaining two.  [[User:Linas|linas]] 21:41, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

: Actually, if someone would "fill it out with the facts" that would be nice.  I intend for this to be an overview of the subject, with ''brief'' treatments of the major theories from Artistotle on down.  So if someone comes along and writes one or two quick paragraph and gravity and GR, with references to the full articles, I will be happy.  (If you want to know something that makes me unhappy it is the "gravity" article talking at length about GR.  That is not needed there, but this article needs to be fixed up first before that text is removed.)  Beyond that, I don't see that this page has any more trouble with silly edits than any of the others. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 23:28, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

::OK, I apologize for my rash actions and loud words, I just sort of tripped over this on the way to elsewhere. However, I'm still of the opinion that gravity/gravitation should be one article that explains the differences between the two. This is based on my experience with some of the math articles, on vectors and coord frames, where we have a bunch of inadequate, lacking articles that talk mostly about the same things. Thus, I'd rather see one long article that "talks about it all", than two partial articles. If the one big article gets too long, it can always be split (into two long articles). The stubiness of this one is what prompts my desire to merge.

== Wikipedia ontology and taxonomy on this article ==

I have put Gravitation in the "Gravity" category so that it can be easliy navigated to.  If you have a cow, we can always just create a Gravitation category.  I realize that there there is not a strict parent/child relationship here, but the Gravity category already exists.  It is much like the Art/Arts duality I had to merge together:  people ''eventually'' will be able to figure out the fine distinction, but first they have to find the thing.  As you can see, I have also added a "See also" pointer to gravity. -- [[User:Fplay|Fplay]] 05:10, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

: I also suggest that you work out some understanding about this thing:

:: First things first:  '''Gravitation is not gravity.'''  There is a parent-child relationship here:  Gravitation is the overall concept, while gravity is a theory of gravitation.  Please, please do not confuse the two.  I know that work is needed to sort things out since the gravity article (imporperly) includes a section of GR (for instance) and I apologize for not having found the time to do it yet.  As for the portal, there are a few cases where "gravity" is used that "gravitation" would be more appropriate, but overall it is not all that bad.  I will try to straighten out the portal's semantics in the coming days. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 06:23, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== Article Size = 47 kilobytes ==
Article Length = 16 pages (printed).  There seems to be a lot of confusion in this article with regards to size / merge / split ideals.  A group of us had a similar problem with [[thermodynamics]] article last year; it was similarly about 16 pages in length.  Our solution was to write mini-articles for each topic conjoined with “see main” links attached.  By doing this, over several months, we reduced the thermodynamics article to 7 pages (printed) and it is now listed in “good article” standing.  I would suggest following this route with the gravity article.  There is a documented principle (I’ve read somewhere?) which states that online-reading tension spans are limited; and that when an article is too lengthy the reader will typically give up.  Yet, when an article is subdivided, with split-off topics, the reader’s efficiency will improve by allowing focused attention to desired subtopic.  Please refer to the [[thermodynamics]] article as a model.  Just a suggestion: --[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 16:25, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

I would suggest breaking this up into at least five pages; that way some of us who have interest in certain areas can contribute here or there as we please.--[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 04:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

I agree. As a casual reader of science topics and Wikipedia editor, split this baby up. As indicated, splitting off the Newtonian/math section seems appropriate and fairly simple. I'd also suggest keeping quantum mechanics and quantum particle physics out of this altogether, with only brief linking statements about the deeper implications of gravity and attempts at a unified theory. Go ahead and do it Sadi, be bold. [[User:DavidH|DavidH]] 07:22, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the support and ideas, keep them coming (however we can't have 30 headers). Last week I broke up the (over-the-limit) [[love]] article into four pages, and that seemed to go fairly well:

*[[love]]
*[[love (scientific views)]]
*[[love (cultural views)]]
*[[love (religious views)]]

If I break up this one, I will likely outline it similar to that of Britannica’s (CD-ROM) article on '''gravitation'''.  They do a redirect from gravity to gravitation; this is the way it is done in most physics textbooks as well.  Britannica has over 200 year’s experience on this matter.  Similarly, from the [[force]] article, as we all know:

'''Types of force'''

There are four known [[fundamental force]]s in nature. 
*[[strong nuclear force|Nuclear forces]] acting between subatomic particles
*[[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic forces]] between electric charges
*[[weak nuclear force|Weak forces]] arising from radioactive decay
*[[Gravitational force]]s between masses

Hence, when people look up “gravitation”, “gravity, “force of gravitation”, “gravitational force”, etc., for the sake of organization (without getting into some esoteric debate), we would redirect all to one page; then on this main page, i.e. '''Gravitation''', being short in length, give the following overview of gravitation (with branch-off points throughout): 
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*introduction
*'''History''' 
::{{with [[see main]]}}
:short paragraph
*'''Newton’s Law''' 
::{{with [[see main]]}}
:short paragraph
*'''Relativity'''

:short paragraph
{{col-break}}
*'''Recent theories''' 
::{{with [[see main]]}}
:short paragraph

*'''See also'''
*'''References'''
*'''External links'''
{{col-end}}
This is rough outline (maybe with one more section?).  We would then put the rest in the '''See also''' section, thus keeping the main page very simple.  In this manner, it will have room to grow.  If we have any grave objections we can always revert.  Again, if someone else wants to do the break up then by all means do so.  Are we all relatively O.K with this?--[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 17:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

== Hmm... ==

Wouldn't it be useful to separate [[Gravity]] from [[Gravity theory]]?  The former would include the documented evidence, and the latter would include the speculative thought.  This is how many similar topics are discussed.  (See: [[theory#List of famous theories]]). [[User:KSchutte|KSchutte]] 19:14, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

:That would be nice in principle; however, what happens is that people stumble upon the lesser of the two articles, assume it to be an untapped editing prospect, then start adding duplicate content, e.g. there were two separate history sections growing on the former separate “gravity” and “gravitation” articles.  Read the arguments on the archive pages as well. --[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 15:44, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

== Einstein's nationality ==

The current text is "American (German-born) physicist [[Albert Einstein]]".  My object is that Einstein was a German physicist at time [[general relativity]] was created, and IMO should be listed as such.  That he later emigrated to America is immaterial to his status at the time general relativity was developed.  The other option is not to deal with the nationalities of well-known people like Einstein and Newton at all.

::I agree with you both; however, as a general of thumb (in science writing) most attach a name to a nationality + type of scientist; whereby we assume, no matter how famous, that the reader has no prior knowledge of the person.  In this manner, the learning process is improved: people will attach an unknown name, such as “Albert Einstein” with an occupation, as “physicist”, to a national origin, as “German-born American”.  This, by the way, is how [[Merriam-Webster]] describes Einstein in their one paragraph summary.--[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 17:23, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

::: In 1915, Einstein's renouncing his German citizenship was still ~20 years in the future.  The issue is one of do we describe Einstein as he was when he created the theory, or as he was at his death?  A case can be made for both, or for the alternative of not mentioning nationality at all in order to avoid this can of worms.  At this point, my temptation is to leave it alone unless a consensus appears to change it, partially out of respect to Sadi's argument above and partially out of respect for the amount of thought and work that Sadi is putting into these articles. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:12, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

The article failed to reach good article status because:

* The applications section is poorly focused and the link to Lynton & Lynmouth Cliff does not work. There are obviously a number of applications of gravitation and the section would benefit from being rewritten.
**commented out the L&LC link. [[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 01:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
* The alternatives section does not properly highlight how widely accepted such theories are or are not.
* The article could use a better sectioning. "Related" is not a good section heading for half the article's content.
* Overall the article felt a little brief for such an important subject. Specifically it seemed to lack discussion on 20th and 21st century research/findings related to the subject beyond the brief synopsis it gave of Einstien's work (and the occassional references it made to open questions).

Please feel free to resubmit this article, once you feel these points have been addressed.

==Tesla/Puthoff crank-POV pushing edits==

[[User:Sadi Carnot]] (?!) apparently [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitation&diff=43688920&oldid=43686271 added] (by some mistake?) these descriptions:

* [[Nikola Tesla]] challenged [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], announcing he was working on a ''[[Dynamic theory of gravity]]'' (which began between 1892 and 1894) and argued that a "''[[Field (physics)|field of force]]''" was a better concept and focused on [[Plasma physics|media with electromagnetic energy]] that fill all of [[space-time|space]].
* [[Induced gravity]]: In 1967 [[Andrei Sakharov]] proposed something similar, if not essentially identical. His theory has been adopted and promoted by Messrs. Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff who, among other things, explain that gravitational and inertial mass are identical and that high speed rotation can reduce (relative) mass. Combining these notions with those of [[Thomas Townsend Brown]], it is relatively easy to conceive how field propulsion vehicles such as "flying saucers" could be engineered given a suitable source of power.

These claims are profoundly inaccurate.  Tesla's announcement provides insufficient details to compare it with any published theory.  Sakharov's proposal does have some coherent motivation and is still taken seriously despite (according to the mainstream view) lack of progress along these lines; Tesla's murky ideas have been entirely forgotten.  The work of Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff is fringe physics at best.  Finally, [[Thomas Townsend Brown]] can only be regarded as a crank.

I have eliminated these particular cranky-POV-pushing edits, but there may well be others in this article. May the reader beware.---[[User:Hillman|CH]] 21:57, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

I noticed some other errors, e.g. ''in general relativity gravitational radiation (which under the rules of quantum mechanics must be composed of gravitons) is created only in situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating'' contains at least one error.   This seems to have involved trying to redress the ill effects of some massive merger/redirection war, so the cranky stuff quoted above may have been written by someone else and pasted into this article by Sadi during a rather massive reconstruction, which is why I say above the editions may have been a mistake.  Be this as it may, the fact that they went unnoticed from 13 March 2006 to 13 April 2006 must be troubling to those of us concerned to improve and maintain the reliability of WP as an encylopedia.---[[User:Hillman|CH]] 22:34, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:Hillman, why don't you do some research before pointing fingers.  Every single wikipedia edit is stored in easily-accessible memory.  Thus, if you would have done your investigation properly, you would have found that [[User:Gbleem]] put these questionables into the pre-merger [[Gravity]] article on Nov 2, 2005, see: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravity&diff=next&oldid=27183888 Edit].  Myself, I spent one day only (March 14, 2006) doing a breakup of an over-bulging [[Gravity]] + [[Gravitation]] set of articles.  I would hope, in the future, that you do not go around affixing my name to any other questionable contributions that were made years ago by other people.  Thank-you.--[[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] 02:39, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

Sadi, thanks for clearing this up.  But please [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]].  I think it is clear from my comment above that I ''did'' do some research, in fact I probably tried harder than most editors would have done to figure out what had happened.  I even tried to clearly explain that I suspected I had not uncovered the whole story.  Frankly, instead of yelling at me, I think you should give me credit for finding the edit I cited and for figuring out that it seemed to have something to do with some kind of merger or name change.  I even said that I realized that you might not have been the original author!  All you needed to say here was, ''indeed, during a merger from ''Gravity'', which was then a separate article, I pasted in material written by Gbleem; I now wish I had read that material more carefully''.

The real problem is that in cases like this, where material written by  user U is merged from article A into article B by user V, it can be quite difficult to figure out what happened even by a careful perusal of the history file of B, unless you somehow guess that the needed information might be contained in the history file of A!  In this case, the history file of B didn't tell me what I needed to know, namely that material was being merged by V from A and that I should look in the history file of A to find that the original author of the inaccurate claim was U.  Obviously, it would be very useful to have a ''who-wrote-this?'' tool which is smart enought to unravel this kind of thing even if (as sometimes happens) article A no longer exists or has been reduced to a redirect!

Anyway, thanks for your work in the merger.  I do think this episode shows why anyone carrying out such a merger should try to fact check anything which appears suspicious, since any attempt to improve the WP is rather defeated if one perpetuates such a wild claim.  But I do realize that this might not always be possible.  I think this episode highlights some serious problems with current wikisoftware, which can all too easily lead to this kind of misunderstanding.  I hope that some developer will see this and attempt to develop the kind of tool described in the previous paragraph.---[[User:Hillman|CH]] 02:10, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

As an aside, Tesla also denounced Einstein's methods, stating that "Einstein is trying to replace science with mathematics." This is an apparent reference to the fact that his theories were considered largely unprovable at the time of their publication. [[User:209.214.230.142|209.214.230.142]] 21:25, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

==Tesla was right!==
Gravity is not a pulling force, it is a PUSHING force, it is the [[virtual particle|VIRTUAL PARTICLES]] surrounding a planet, PUSHING down the objects. Matter is mostly space but some objects have farther between the smallest particles, and therefore they are lighter - there is less resistance, less particles to be hit by the virtual particles. Say a piece of lead for example, is very heavy simply because it is dense!. This "[[Plasma physics|media with electromagnetic energy]] that fill all of [[space-time|space]]" EXISTS and is proven, it just happens to have the name [[virtual particle|VIRTUAL PARTICLES]].

== The history section is very strange ==

In the history section there are strange claims about ancient Indians being "the first to recognize gravity as a force of attraction". Namely, [[Brahmagupta]] said in 628 'it is in the nature of the earth to attract bodies'. Is it really something profound and ground-shattering? Does it really differ from what other ancient men thought long before him? 
In the article as it stands now we are supposed to believe that Newton was "building on these foundations". Are you serious? Did Newton know anything about [[Brahmagupta]]?
I can see a lot of articles reflect now [[Hindutva]] propaganda in its crudest form. Am I the only person to resent it?

== A bubble with a man in the center of Earth ==

Okay, one can tell this is coming from someone uneducated. I'm not sure if this is the right place for any inquiry such as this, but it doesn't seem as if putting it here would harm. Now, to the point:
Let us say that there is a bubble of empty space near the center of earth, offset from the center by a certain bit. Now, let us put a man in there, or any object for that sake. How will gravity work on him? And what if we placed him in the actual center of earth, disregarding all realism.
Some might see this as a paradox that means that at some point (assuming mass is evenly distributed throughout the globe), a particle at a certain depth will face less gravity. As such, it seems as if pressure on the particle will also be releaved, at least to an extent.

:Your intuitions are correct. An object at the exact center of the Earth would feel no net gravitational force and would float at the center. The attraction to mass in any direction is exactly counterbalanced by matter in the opposite direction. If slighty offset from center, it would experience some force to move toward the center. It is true that   inside the earth the gravitational force toward the center is less than it is at the surface, since now some the mass is on the other side of the body.

==Electroweak?==
The beginning of the article states, "Gravitation is one of the four fundamental interactions in nature, the other three being the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force."  I read that the electromagnetic and weak forces were aspects of the same process.  I suppose it's now commonly called the electroweak force?  I know that it's not an everyday occurance that they merge into the same force since it takes a lot of energy.  I'm sure there's people who know way more than I here but I figured I'd chime in just in case.  feel free to delete this if it's total nonsense. --some anonymous guy 07:27, 1 September 2006 (EST)

considering the measurements after 1995 only, the deviation of G is
0.7%.
→ The quantity G = G m g / mi does not appear as a constant in

2) A recalculation of Kepler’s third law by Szász with all the nine

the UFF.

chemical elements Li/Be/B/C/ Al/Fe/Pb and has performed a
simultaneous fall experiment in the 110 m high vacuum tube at
the drop tower of ZARM, University of Bremen. The weights of
the test bodies were between ~2 g and ~7 g. The purities were
better than 98.8% in all cases. The test bodies were freely placed
at the middle of the safety glass cylinder. On the back plane of
the experimental equipment, a cm scale was fixed with 0.0 cm at

to Eq. (5). The relative movement of the test bodies was recorded
with a standard CCD video camera. The camera was placed in
front of the middle glass cylinder through a mirror arrangement in
a distance (from the front of objective to the cm scale on the back
ground) of ~ 60 cm directed to the height of 15 cm. The
experimental equipment was fixed in the drop capsule falling
freely in vacuum. The time resolution 0.04 s is to be calculated
from 25 frames/s. From 256x256 pixels, the space resolution is in
order of 1 mm for the quickest relative motion of Li. The time of
fall was mirrored in by film exposure in 40 ms units. The time of
fall with approximately free fall conditions and the relative fall
distances in each time step can be read immediately from single
pictures of film. The following sequence of four pictures shows

:To verify these results one would need more data. E.g. how good the vacuume was, the shape of the falling bodies, method of releasing them, etc. It looks like the experiment (or the reporting) has been done by amateurs while professionals have done them with meassurements of many orders of magnitude more accurate and didn't find any diff between Newtonian equations and the real world. So your results didn't look like worth analizing, however if you don't mind, get the missing data and calculate what is the expected standard deviation. It'll be a nice exercise and you will learn something at the same time. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 14:28, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

==Einstein's Jewish Heritage==
Somewhere in the article, it says that Einstein was German-born.  Recently, someone added that he was Jewish after that clause.  It was quickly reverted.  I think it should stay, for two reasons:
# The sentence said that Einstein was German-born.  That fact that he was of Jewish descent had very serious consequences for him, even before the rise to power of the Nazis.
# He identified himself as a Jew — a nonreligious Jew, but a Jew nonetheless.  He left his personal papers (and other things, I think) to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and generally seemed to be proud of his heritage.  I don't think we should play revisionism.
It might make sense to remove both "German-born" and "Jew", but I think that if one stays, both should stay, because they are so essentially intertwined.  --[[User:MOBle|MOBle]] 12:59, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

: I would support the removal of both.  The detail impresses me as being inappropriate to an overview article such as this one.  If nothing else, this article is about gravitation instead of Einstein, although if there is a guideline that says that the first reference to a physicist should include their country of origin and religous affiliation I would yield to that.

== Missing Einsteinian equation for the ''gravitational force'' ==

In the whole article as well as the linked to it an article on general relativity there is no Einsteinian equation for gravitational force nor any instruction how to calculate it. So what a high school student is going to think about Wikipedia if he is looking for explanation of gravitational force? That Wikipedians think that Newtonian stuff is good enough for him? Maybe this is what most of them think but is it right thinking?

Furtheremore there is the following item counted as achievement of general relativty:
* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson-Walker metric]]) was confirmed by [[Edwin Hubble]] in [[1929]].
Edwin Hubble didn't "confirm the expansion", he only proposed a law that redshift of galaxies changes linearly with their distance form us. Which was wrong anyway since Einsteinian physics predicts exponential change which simulates accelerating expansion. Anyway, since this item is wrong I propose to replace it with 
* The 'anomalus' acceleration of space probes Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 has been predicted by Einsteinian gravitation within less than half standard deviation (this is still an [[original research]] but it might be not anymore probably earlier than Wikipedians reach a consensus on what changes should be made in Gravitation).

:: There are a number of things wrong with this the initial message here:
::# In [[general relativity]], gravitation '''is not''' due to a [[force]].  Therefore there is no equation for gravitational force in general relativity.
::#:Gravitation is of course not due to a force but it does not make general relativity (GR) unable to calculate a gravitational force that acts eg. on a guy standing on the Earth. If you mean that GR is not able to calculate this force you simply don't know basics of GR and you are not someone who can instruct people on what is right and what's wrong in gravitation. The way to calculate gravitational force in GR is this: take invariant energy of a guy (from any textbook on GR, for the mass of the guy of course) differentiate it with respect to guy's proper distance from let's say surface of the Earth (standard for calculating "forces") reverse the sign and your result is the ''gravitational force'' with which the guy acts on the Earth. Then you will also see why it is only an inertial force and not some mysterious ''attraction'' as 19 century thinkers call it. Pretty simple derivation and I don't see it anywhere in whole gravitation page as if it never existed and I remember well placing it there. GR would be a very poor theory if it didn't allow to calculate in a simple way, that a high school student can understand, a gravitational force. The calculation is in fact so simple that is shown mostly in popular texts (like mine) since professionals don't bother with high school calculus. Which does not mean that high school calculus is useless and can't be used in a standard way to calculate forces. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 11:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

Kindly note that accelerating expansion of the universe is a result of modern observations!  It can be described using an EFE solution, but is not a unique prediction of general relativity.  (Note that the enabling EFE solution requires the universe to be 70% [[dark energy]], 26% [[dark matter]], and 4% normal matter.  So the acceleration is being used to predict to composition of the universe and not the other way around.)

::::Come on. One doesn't need tensor calculus to calculate gravitational force. Simple differentiation of energy of a particle (like in [[Lev Landau|Landau]] and Lifshitz, ''Theory of Fields'', eq. 88.9) with respect to distance, suffices. Elementary high school physics. Every high school student who wants to know how gravitational force is generated in Einstein's theory may learn it in 10 minutes. The problem is though that whenever the derivation of gravitational force is placed in wikipedia someone who has never seen it before, considers it original research and replaces it with Newtonian "force". So the high school students tend to believe (as it is stated at the beginning of the article by some 19 century thinker) that ''gravitation is a phenomenon through which all objects attract each other''. So unless editors start learning 20 century physics nothing can be done. But once they do the high school students see how simple Einstein's physics is and the only problem with it has been that editors of wikipedia haven't understood it a bit, since (as the same [[Lev Landau|Landau]] said) it's tough to explain things that one doesn't understand himself.

==  Question about gravitation for the article ==

A question of mine that might be interesting for the article: when two bodies impact each other and join they become one with a single gravitational field, but what if they are just touching? What if we have a 50 km asteroid and a 100 m asteroid is made to touch down gently on the surface? Does just touching the larger one increase its gravitational field or does it require something else? What is the exact borderline for when objects become one in gravitational terms?

[[User:Mithridates|Mithridates]] 15:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

: Semantically, that is a question for astrononmers.  In terms of the gravitational field, the farther you are from the object (objects?), the more appropriate it becomes to treat them as one object of the combined mass instead of two objects.  Thus holds true even in the objects are in orbit about each other.  (For example, to model the trajectory of a spacecraft in Earth orbit you would consider the Moon as a seperate object, but to model the orbit of [[Pluto]] it is fine to treat the Earth/Moom system as a single mass unless your calculation were are extremely high precision.) --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:41, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

One quick comment:

I don't think it's a verifiable fact that Galileo dropped anything from the Tower of Pisa. As far as I understand most historians consider that an urban legend, seeing that Galileo would generally be very specific in his observations and therefore it would be a very unprofessional experiment. Any thoughts?

== Existence of Gravity ==

These needed to be added to the article, or made so they stand out and are understandable to the user, because even i am left w/ these questions:
::1 Can Gravitation be proved?
::2 If so, is there a way to prove it other than mathematically?
::3 If gravitation is real, what is it? Matter? If not, is it actually in existence? (dont bring in philisophical/religious stuff in, i.e. "spirits exist, so gravity can")
::4 Why the gravitational theory is a theory and not a fact/law.
::[[User:Toastthemost|toaster]] 02:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

: I can tell you that gravitation is an observed fact.  After all, the planets go around the Sun and we are constantly pulled downward towards the center of the Earth.  In essense "gravitation" is the name of an observed phenomenon.

: As for "proving" gravitation:  You don't do it mathmatically to begin with.  Instead it is the observation that matters.  A combination of math and observation comes in when one seeks to verify that a given theory of gravitation is correct.  In fact, this also brings up to your last question, since any explanation of gravitation is just a model and not the reality.  Even if a given theory is exactly right, there is no way from first principles to prove that gravitation must exist and have exactly certain properties.  Given that, any theory of gravitation must be just a theory due to its carrying with itself its own postulates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 20:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

== How to teach editors gravitation? ==

Whenever one tries to replace statements of Newton's gravitation with corresponding statements of Einstein's gravitation the editors reverse the changes. Often without any good reason beyond ''a vague impression that it might be original research''. As it happens to me a lot and they don't even answer a question what they consider ''original research''. While I'm only trying to popularize Einstein's theory and everything I write Einstein already knew. However not editors of Wikipedia. Which is rather sad because it's almost a century of ignorance.

And this reversing is probably not because they want to prevent Wikipedia users from learning gravitation. Most likely the reason is that they don't understand a bit about gravitation and think that Newton's theory about it, which they remember from school, is science. They think that Einstein's gravitation ''should be close enough'' to Newton's and ignore the fact that while it is (almost) the same math it describes a completely different physics. So whatever is not ''close enough'' to Newtonian physics should be deleted. Even something like derivation of a gravitational force because it can't be derived with Newton's theory. They don't know how to derive it so they suspect it of being never derived even by Einstein (otherwise how it could be ''close enough''?). They must assume that Einstein discovered theory of gravitation without addressing the issue of gravitational force. It might sound funny but this is really the case with most editors. Which is telling us that some of them must be intellectually challenged yet they keep editing Wikipedia and that's why Wikipedia is so much retarded in the area of gravitation. And that's why there is a problem with editors which better be solved. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 22:20, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::Dear EMS, when you're standing on the Earth there is a force that is pressing you to the Earth. It is called by physicists in my university (and by a little me as well) a ''gravitational force''. How do ''you'' call it? And how do you think Einstein had called it? 
:::::Can you explain this force and calculate it from the curvatures of sapacetime in a way that a high school student can repeat your derivation from memory (as I've done many times, just using text from ''1973, Landau and Lifshitz'') and make the derivation stay in Wikipedia for more than a week?
:::::As for your strong opinion about gravitational force you are probably saying that there is no such force between objects that are not in contact with each other (i.e. that this ''force'' does not act at the distance) which is surely true but nobody except all those Wikipedia editors say there is such a force so it is irrelevant for the purpose of educating high school students in contemporary physics. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 17:05, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

Has anyone seen JimJast's questions to all the board candidates? Can you believe this guy? Either he is a complete idiot, or he is speaking a language other than English (a bizarre language known only to Physics PHD students), or both. Just accept that gravity is the natural force that attracts massive objects to each other, as any kindergarten student can prove. This is not the place for writing your PHD thesis. This is an encyclopedia for ordinary people who speak English. Gravity is a remarkably simple concept. The total unreadability of all the scientific articles in this Encyclopedia is entirely the fault of scientists such as JimJast who are unable or unwilling to speak normal English or to recognise that the average editor knows a fair bit about the subject. The next person who says a line is not a line because it isn't infinately long should be made to swallow a dictionary. [[User:CarlKenner|Carl Kenner]] 13:10, 5 July 2007 (UTC)
: I have taken a look at it.  Overall it is nothing but the same self-serving bellyaching that I have seen in other contexts.  For now, I will place Jim Jast in the "a little knowledge is dangerous" category.  As for the candidates, one has made a blanket statement that shows no research into this matter, another that I looked at called on Jim to work with us, and the overall majority seem to have enough sense (or lack of time) to not respond at all.  Let's just say that I have a hard time faulting those who don't respond.
: As for the science writing here:  The problem is that more editors are needed who are interested in this stuff, and who appreciate Wikipedia for what it is.  Much here is written by experts, and unfortunately reflects that.  This creates an ironic situation whereby the the process if improving Wikipedia means that many articles must be "degraded".  An example of that ironically is Jum's edit:  I actually have some sympathy for it's intent (being a [[general relativity]] person myself).  However, Wikpedia is for everyone and not just [[Ph. D.]]s.  That is why I agree with you about keeping the definition of gravitation simple, but do note that I for one refuse to allow the word "force" to appear in the first paragraph due to Einstein's work. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:40, 6 July 2007 (UTC)

==POV fork (?)==

A couple of days ago, [[User:JimJast]] changed the term [[gravitational attraction]] from a redirect to "Gravitation" into an article of its own. I don't know whether such a separate article is required, or maybe the things should be included in the existing articles on gravitation, but the main problem is that [[User:JimJast]] dedicated that article to a philosophy of his own (starting the definition with the words "gravitational attraction is a myth", and later saying "There are no gravitational forces between particles that are free to move as e.g. between the stars and the planets of the universe"). I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitational_attraction&diff=114417229&oldid=114273902 tried] to make the article more balanced, and discussed the issues with [[User:JimJast]] on the Talk page, and presented references (including a textbook) showing that there are well-established alternative ways to look at the subject, and his general statements are incorrect. Nevertheless, he reverted most of my edits, and put his wrong ideas back. Please join the discussion. Thanks, [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 21:09, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

: I have reverted the article to being a redirect, and chastised Jim in the [[talk:gravitational attraction|talk page]].  However, we will need to watch that page.  [[User:JimJast|JimJast]] is a regular troll here, who does not understand that difference between one's personal ideas and the accepted scientific viewpoint.  He has been trying to push his odd ideas of talk pages for the last few months, and obviously thought that he had found an avenue here for presenting them in the article space.  His [[WP:OR|original research]] is not acceptable here, but Jim obviously does not see his OR as being just that.

: I looked at your edit of that article and did like it.  Please feel free to use it to add to this article as needed.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::Dear Yevgeny and EMS, Finally I looked at "Gravitation" Talk page (which I have no intention to edit since I don't have time to argue with editors who prefer [[faith]] over [[data]]) and I saw that you guys don't like GR and [[Lew Landau|Landau]]'s explanation of gravitational energy that I've put it on the page "[[gravitational attraction]]". Apparently you prefer gravitational attraction being real which is your right, however not allowed to be excercized in Wikipedia. So while you may be right, for the time being it is only your private POV since official version is still Einstein's. The point is you don't have yet any official theory to support your POV. That's the only thing we don't agree about: you think your POV is valid since you believe that the (future) [[quantum gravity]] is going to confirm it. I doubt, since I doubt in many things, but Wikipedia's policy of [[NPOV]] is clearly on my side here: don't push your POV until it is supported by a relieable source. For the time being GR is considered more reliable than quantum gravity. And this is not my fault so please be reasonable.

::As to the "fact" that our feet are "attractd" to the Earth (as EMS suggests in line with your POV) then I explained it in the page ''gravitational attraction'' in agreement with Landau's equation provided there. Unfortunately both Einstein and Landau are dead so we can't consult them but their texts are still around and we can find out whether they believed in ''gravitational attraction'' the same way that you do. It is basically an argument betwen you and Einstein's. So please prove that general relativity (the actual theory of gravitation that Wikipedia is supposed to promote rather than ''quantum gravity'' that many other physicists prefer) supports your POV and not Einstein's and then we are all set. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 08:34, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::: I find it hard to deny that there exists a gravitational acceleration between objects.  Whether you wish to align the word "attraction" with "force" instead of "acceleration" is an interesting question, but the bottom line is that the phenomenon exists.  Beyond that, you don't seem to understand Einstein's GR view on gravaitation, or at least have a very non-standard way of expressing it.  I also find Landau's explanation to be quite cumbersome and unhelpful.  Most treatments of mass in a gravitational field consider the mass as having decreased instead of ''c'' having done so (although that approach works too), and the use of the energy change as a cause of gravitational acceleration provides only a first approximation of how curvature causes particles to move. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)


== Inertial Paradox? ==
This statement is not self-evident: "In flat spacetimes such as those of classical mechanics and special relativity, there is no way that inertial observers can accelerate with respect to each other, as free-falling bodies can do as they are each accelerated towards the center of a massive object."  

Given Observer A and Observer B falling toward Mass C, the the statement implies there is no way for A and B to accelerate toward eachother. To me this says there is "no way" A and B can have a gravitational force between them (albiet small).  Why not?  What is the proof of this assertion? [[User:Dw31415|Dw31415]] 17:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

: If a force is being exerted on them, they are not inertial observers.  So in classical mechanics, that statement is moot.  However, in general relativity, it is very, very important:  In GR, there is no force that causes gravitation.  So another mechanism (in this case spacetime curvature) takes the place of gravity and acts as the source of the gravitational field. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:00, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:: I don't think that paragraph in the article makes sense at all.

:: First of all, the sentence before the one cited above says: "inertial motion occurs when objects are in free-fall instead of when they are at rest with respect to a massive object such as the Earth (as is the case in classical mechanics)". It's incorrect to say that in classical mechanics a reference frame is inertial when it's attached to a heavy body. If the heavy body is accelerating, the frame won't be inertial. If the heavy body is rotating, the frame won't be inertial. Furthermore, a heavy body isn't a part of the story at all. An observer can be inertial even if he is very light and not attached to anything.

:: As for the sentence cited by Dw31415, that sentence is wrong too. Since bodies may be free falling with a different acceleration in different places (e.g., on opposite sides of the Earth), they will have an acceleration relative to each other. 

::Furthermore, I don't know if that new definition of inertial motion that is used in that paragraph is very standard. At least a definition should be given for what is meant by that. [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 19:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

::: That sentence is of my devising.  It is quite technical yet more-or-less says what I want it to say.  You are correct that rotation and orbital motion keep the Earth from being a inertial frame is classical mechanics.  Perhaps we can hash out how to correct that.  The part about inertia in GR is unforutnately quite technical, but is also concise.  I am open to suggestions on how to improve that also (or even that section).  It may be that this is not the best place to make the point that I am trying to make, although I personally prefer to make it here. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 20:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

::::EMS, I propose that the sentence be recast into [[subjunctive mood]]. --[[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 10:06, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
::::For example "If a photon were ... then ...."
Thanks for taking a look at my concern.  I think this introductory paragraph would do well to continue the thread of how this theory explains the Mecury orbit does not match what would be predicted by Newton's equations. After all that's the way one theory replaces another, right (the new one is consistant with observations that the old one cannot explain). [[User:Dw31415|Dw31415]] 04:28, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

: If you are suggesting what I think you are suggesting, then I strongly advise against it.  "[H]ow this theory explains the Mecury orbit ..." requires that use of a level of detail that I have largely avoided even in the [[general relativity]] article itself.  In this article, I want to stick with the issues of "what", and leave the issues of "how" to other articles.  (Maybe an [[orbits in general relativity]] article could go into the details, but that is going to be another project IMO.) --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 05:08, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I'm a Mechanical Engineer by training, so I spent four happy years with Newton and we worked well together.  For the last 15 years, I've tried to find a coherent explaination of how Einstein and Relativity added a more accurate explanation of what type of phenomenum (sp?). One of my biggest frustrations is that the experts always go to some highly abstracted example (like you're falling in an elevator at the speed of light...).  I think the opening paragraph is in that same vein.  I think the opening paragraph should focus on real phenomenum first. Wouldn't Newton's equations properly account for the forces in the first example (two small masses and a big one)? Thanks again (And Ancheta, since I'm trying to get us to revise the transition between two theory's of gravity, this seems like the right place.) [[User:Dw31415|Dw31415]] 15:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

: General relativity really is a very technical thing.  That is not to say that I cannot do better in expressing what it is, but it is going to take some figuring.  Here is a alternate explanation.  Pull something together using it:
:: ''General relativity is a theory in which expains gravitation as being the result of spacetime have a [[curvature|curved]] topology.  The central way in which general relativity differ's from Newtonian physics is in its definition of inertia.  In Newton's theory, standing on the surface of an extremely large mass which is not rotating or being accelrated puts you in an inertial frame of reference with the downward force of gravity being balanced by the upward force from the resistance of the surface; while a free-falling object is only subject to the force of gravity.  What Einstein realized was that the force of gravity being proportional to the mass of the falling object means that gravity is a [[fictitious force]].  This is turn means the free-fall is really a form of inertial motion, while standing on the surface of a massive object places one in an accelerated state of motion.
:: ''The identification of free-fall as inertial motion conflicts with Newtonian physics and also special relativity in that inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other.  (Note that in Newton's second law, all physical accelerations are due to a force.)  However, side-by-side objects free-falling towards a planet are being accelerated towards each other (as they head faster and faster towards the center of the object); while when the objects are one above the other they will diverge (due to one being pulled on more strongly than the other).  If free-fall in inertial motion, then these relative accelerations cannot be due to a force.  The key to the issue is that both Newtonian physics and special relativity assume that space (or spacetime for special relativity) is flat.  Einstein removed that restriction in general relativity, and produced a theory where inertially moving objects can accelerate spontaneously due to the shape of spacetime.''
: I have a feeling that I am saying too much and too little here.  You comments would be appreciated. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:38, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:: I have done some tweaking of this article to better communicate what GR is.  Please let me know what  you think of the changes.  However, please do be advised that GR is not a simple topic, while this article necessarily must be an overview on the major theories and issues involving gravitation.  The places where greater accessibility would be helpful are the [[introduction to general relativity]] and the [[general relativity]] articles. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::: I'd say it's better now, but still not completely satisfactory. The sentences
:::: '' The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other. In Newtonian physics, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force (and therefore is not moving inertially).''
::: are somewhat problematic. The first sentence may give an impression that free-falling objects can't accelerate with respect to each other in Newtonian physics (which is certainly not what you meant; you wanted to say something like "in general relativity, inertial observers can accelerate..."). Also, I think it's not really clear what point you're trying to make, e.g., why the inertial observers are defined differently and what's the importance of that. The answer is something along the lines that in general relativity the physics is described in the same way not only by inertial observers, but by any observer, including the accelerating ones. [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 02:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:::: I will think on what I can do here.  I can see where some rewording will help in communicating the intended meaning, but have not yet figured out what that should be.  The fact that I am assumming the general principle of relativity here without stating it or something similar may or may not be a serious issue.  When you are faced with having to put 10 pounds of it into a 5 pound bag, something has to give.  This can only be a concise but accurate statement of what GR is at best, which hopefully will help to point the reader in the right direction if they should care to read more in the related articles. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 03:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

== Improving "gravitaton" page ==

Hi Everybody. Recently the page ''"gravitational attraction"'' where I expained the nature of gravitational attraction got redirected by vote 9:1 to ''"gravitation"'' that unfortunately contains inaccuracies in its desription of nature. So, since it seems that we have no much choice but to explain the gravitational attraction in ''"gravitation"'', we need to clean up the page to reflect what about gravitation is published in [[reliable source|reliable sources]]. 

For that reason whatever is contradicting the contemporary knowledge of gravitation in this page has to be changed to whatever [[reliable source|reliable sources]] say about real gravitation rather than what some editors put for whatever reasons into this page. The first thing that I propose to change is the opening sentence ''"Gravitation is a phenomenon through which all objects attract each other"'' since this is neither true nor [[reliable source|reliable published source]] says so. It turns out that in our universe (as proposed by [[Einstein]] and we have to stick to it for already explained reasons) no object attracts any other. The alleged attraction is an over three centuries old prejudice, believed in also by many physicists, apparently for wrong reasons, since they couldn't come up yet, after so many years of trying, with consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]]. It should be finally explained why the behaviour of objects looks as they were attracted to each other. Between other things to allow those physicists to understand gravity better.

Before that though I propose to change this opening sentence back to what was there which read something like ''"Gravitation is a phenomenon through which objects tend to get closer to massive objects in their vicinity"''. After reaching an agreement on this first change we explain why they look as if they were "attracted" to thoses massive objects, as I did it in my redirected page. For now I'd like to have your agreement to this first change (which I expect knowing your opinions about Einstein might need some debate) and if the consensus is reached we might go on with this first and then with further improvements until we fix all the problems. So please express your opinions about this project. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 23:53, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

:A couple of comments to Jim:
:1. Wikipedia isn't a place to do revolutions in the way knowledge is commonly presented, so I think it will only be agreed that your suggested approach will reflect itself only in slight changes to the wording of this article (if necessary at all) and/or a few comments (again, if they aren't there already). Note also that the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gravitational attraction|decision]] was clearly '''redirect''' rather than '''merge''' (and many editors there specifically opposed the contents of that article) so you'll need a good consensus in order to implement your suggestions here.
:2. I think your suggestion for the first sentence is very awkward. Using the word "attraction" is very standard, and Wikipedia isn't a place to suggest changes in the language. Furthermore, I don't think using the word "attraction" is incorrect.
:(a) Main reason: The phenomenon we're talking about is known as attraction because it behaves as attraction.
:(b) Secondary reason: You can describe exactly the same physics of general relativity in the mathematical framework of [[quantum field theory]] as we discussed [[Talk:Gravitational attraction#Gravitation with attraction instead of curvatures of spacetime?|here]] (including several reliable sources), where the attraction is real (mediated by [[graviton]] exchange, not spacetime curvature), as real as the electromagnetic attraction (that is mediated by [[photon]]s). Note also that this doesn't depend on the theory of [[quantum gravity]] (which might not be a field theory at all: string theory isn't a quantum field theory), as I already mentioned there. So please don't repeat that as a counterargument. Gravitons in quantum field theory are a well-established concept (e.g., according to the citation you yourself brought from Zee's textbook), even though the theory of quantum gravity isn't known yet. As for your intention
::''to allow those physicists to understand gravity better''
:I appreciate your help (and I'm sure that [[Anthony Zee|Zee]], [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] that I gave as [[Talk:Gravitational attraction#Gravitation with attraction instead of curvatures of spacetime?|sources]] will/would appreciate it too :)) [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 01:39, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::Hi Yevgeny, ''"attraction"'' is of course an abbreviation for ''"[[graviton|force of universal gravitational attraction]]"''. Since, as you correctly noticed, ''"Wikipedia isn't a place to do revolutions"'' we should concentrate first on finding a [[reliable source|reliable published source]] that supports the idea that there is such a force in nature. Once we find it we are all set. However Newton didn't believe in such possibility (for his lack of [[faith]] in [[action at distance (physics)]]) and even less Einstein (for the same reason) so we may have problems with this finding. [[Anthony Zee|Zee]], [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] and even [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] hoped for finding [[gravitons|particles of spin 2]] carrying that force but unfortunately didn't produce yet [[reliable source|reliable published sources]] that we could use as Wikipedia requires. So if we won't succeed what choice do we have as to admit that Newton and Einstain might be the only [[reliable source|reliable published sources]]? And then the change of ''"gravitation"'' will be forced on us by Wikipedia's strict policy that can't be changed by a consensus even if we love "gravitational attraction" as over 99% of population. So much that it is already included in [[urban legends]] of our time. So let's go to work and find [[reliable source|reliable published source]] that supports the idea of gravitational attraction being real. We may wait five days for suitable candidate to show up and then we either leave ''"gravitation"'' as it is or correct it according to Wikipedia policy, regreting that new ideas are so difficult to implement here. Is it a fair solution in your opinion? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 06:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::: Jim - I second Yevgeny's comments, especially regarding the meaning of "attraction".  If I was to change the wording in the lead, it would be to say that each mass causes all other masses to be "accelerated towards" itself.  However, I would want to see a consensus expressed for such a change before it is made.

::: I must admit that I have found your comments to be so strange that I for a while doubted that you knew relativity theory at all.  Even now, you are making remarks that raise red flags about yourself:  I have yet to see an editor insist that their view is mandated by "Wikipedia policy" who is not in fact going against said policy.  Einstein and Newton are only primary sources, but [[WP:RS]] calls for the use of both primary and secondary sources, with the secondary sources being accepted texts which elaborate on the primary sources such as [[Gravitation (book)|MTW]], and Wald's "General Relativity" amongst others, and prbably a whole set of books of classical mechanics that I am not familiar with due to my focus on relativity theory.  I do not see your viewpoint as being Einstein's view, but instead as being your view of what Einstein's view is, which is not acceptable.  Instead, it is the consensus of the scientists in the field that matters here, and I see no evidence that said consensus is being misrepresented here. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 13:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::::EMS - ''"all other masses to be 'accelerated towards' itself"'' isn't a good wording. I propose ''"Gravitation is a tendency of objects to get closer to each other"''. It is neutral on the controvercial subjects of ''"attraction"'' and ''"acceleration"'', even regardless of what one means by them. Later the reasons for ''"getting closer"'' might be proposed as ''"force of gravitational attraction"'' or ''"shape of geodesics in spacetime"'' with an addition about which theory is supported by the contemporary science. 

::::If you don't understand something then quote the unclear fraze and ask the author what he meant. It's faster then reporting your feelings and expecting the author to guess what ''you'' mean.

::::Recommending something like [[Gravitation (book)|MTW]] is a good thing. I myself have read it a few times already and I still have it so it's easier for me to check it. The same goes for Wald's book. However I don't remember all of it, so if you find there a support for ''"attractive force"'' let's use the appropriate quote since both are considered [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] describing a contemporary gravitational theory. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 16:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::::: I can't say that I like "getting closer" since a body in an elliptical orbit gets closer and then father away.  IMO, you are attaching to the word "attract" the connotation for "force".  I don't see it.  I can see why others will see that word and assume that a force is being referred to, but I don't see any utility in trying to communicate the fundamentals of GR to people in the lead.  Let GR be implied there, and let people read in the GR section that the attraction is not due to a force.  If they cannot handle that, then so be it, but don't try to tell them that "the force of gravity does not exist".  I agree with what you are trying to say with that kind of statement, but most of the readers of this page will assume that you are <s>a vandal who is</s> denying the physical reality of gravitation.  That just plain is not good. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::::: Whether one uses Newton's theory, or knows about general relativity, or doesn't know either of them, "tend to get closer" = "attract". There is nothing else implied by the word "attract", so there is no reason to switch to the awkward formulation "tend to get closer". [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 18:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::From Wikipedia: '''''[[Attraction]]: In general, attraction is a force that moves one object to another'''''. E.g. if a car hits a tree, which is similar to a colision with the Earth when somthing drops form certain hight, no one would assume a force pulling the car towards the tree, and consequently no one would assume some kind of ''attraction'' between the car and the tree. So why to assume something like that in a case of something dropping on the Earth? The only reason seems to be a Newtonian prejudice that the Earth "attracts" things. According to general relativity the collision between the car and the tree is the same kind of collision as between something and the Earth. No attraction in neither case, just crossing of worldlines due to ''other reasons''. The encyclopedia should clarify prejudices in a spirit of contemporary science. Don't you agree that the first sentence of the present form of ''"[[gravitation]]"'' supports a traditional prejudice? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 14:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::: First of all, I am loathe to consider Wikipedia to be a reliable source in so far as the issue of the meaning of "attaction" is concerned.  Secondly, when a woman attacts a man, there is not a physical force involved.  So the word generically does not demand a force.  IMO, the bias that you are fighting is the Newtonian one that any observed acceleration must be due to a force acting on either the observer, the observed object, or both.  You are not going to deal with that by saying that the force of gravity does not exist in the lead.  Instead, you would confuse everyone not familiar with GR.  Besides, under [[WP:NPOV]], it is not the job of the encyclopedia to rule on gravity vs. GR.  Instead, it is the job here to present the facts in as unbiased a means as possible.  First of all, please note the title of this article:  It is "gravitation", not "gravity"!  Whether the reader realizes it or not, the name that reads "force" is not the title of this article.  Then read the first sentence of the GR section, where I state right off the bat that GR does not ascribe gravitation to a force.  Finally, note the large number of observations cites as proof the GR is right and gravity is not.  In the end, the message that you want people to get is there.  It just is not being announced out loud in the lead.  Personally, I think that the article is much better that way. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::As I expected we can't move beyond the first sentence yet :-). So let's do it slowly: 
::::::::Please list all the features that make this article better than my version. 

::::::::My objections to the article are that it is about physics but it is not following the physics since in "Gravitation" page there is no attraction in a physical sense, as a force, but rather in a psychological sense as a woman attracting another woman (both "attracting" masses are of the same "sex"). It does the "attraction" without any physical force since physical force is only in Newtonian gravitation and we already know it is wrong. Your standard of making the article much better seems to be only that the Newtonian prejudice of the reader about gravitations are confirmed and he's not shocked by learning that what he learned in a high school is actually wrong. In my opinion the reader needs this shock to appreciate the change that physics went through since 19th century. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 23:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

I just read the "[[General relativity]]" and "[[Introduction to general relativity]]" pages. IMHO, the problem with ''"Gravitation"'' page (correct me if I'm wrong) is that no one writing about it understands the simple '''''Einsteinian physics''''' behind it. The editors are trying to push into those pages all they know about the math forgetting that it has no meaning for those for whom encyclopedias are written. Consequently the gravitation remains a mess, a mystery to the readers, to the editors, and even to many non familiar with GR physicists. In short a bad popularization.

In particular, I didn't find in those pages an explanation of so called "gravitational attractive force", why it looks like "attraction", why it is really a [[pseudo force]], how this pseudo force it is generated by the curvatures of spacetime (the thing that I put into "Gravitational attraction" page and it was removed from Wikipedia by 9:1 vote on a theory that it is my private POV (and possibly [[Lev Landau|Landau's]] private POV, not acceptable to Wikipedia editors).

==Gravity versus gravitation==
The article claims that in scientific terminology the term "gravity" refers to the Newtonian force, while other theories (such as general relativity) should use the term "gravitation". I don't think it's true. For example, a search in Google Scholar gives [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22Einsteinian+gravity%22 276 hits] for the expression "Einsteinian gravity", and only [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22Einsteinian+gravitation%22 83 hits] for "Einsteinian gravitation", which is the opposite trend from what the article claims.

We can also search for "Newtonian gravity" [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Newtonian+gravity%22&hl=en&lr= 4320 hits] and "Newtonian gravitation" [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22Newtonian+gravitation%22 1320 hits].

As you see, in both cases the word "gravity" is used about 3.3 times more than "gravitation", without any difference whether they refer to Newtonian or Einsteinian theory. Therefore, I suggest removing that section, and just mentioning both terms in the first sentence of the article as synonyms. [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 01:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

: Yevgeny - I think that the idea of merging that section into the introduction is a reasonable one.  However, the term "Einsteinian gravity/gravitation" is used almost exclusively by those of us who are seeking to distance ourselves from general relativity itself.  Given the type of person who usually takes on such a project, I am not surprised to see "Einsteinian gravity" used more than "Einsteinian gravitation".

: A little history will also come in handy here.  For a long time, that section '''was''' this article.  That was all that it said, and I guarded it zealously to keep it from being redirected to [[gravity]].  I always intended to expand it one day, but never quite got around to it.  Suddenly, just over a year ago,  [[User:Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] comes along and rearranges everything related to Newtonian gravity and the development of gravitational theory.  That is when this page became the main page related to gravity and gravitation.  Realizing that Sadi was aware of my point and running with it farther and faster than I could, I just plain got out to the way but made sure that the section in question did not get lost in the shuffle.

: Overall, I have found that most GR researchers prefer to talk about "gravitation" and "gravitational theory".  Most textbooks that I have seen refer to GR as a theory of ''gravitation'' instead of a theory of gravity.  Jim Jast's point that "gravity does not exist" is actually fundamental to relativity theory (in a form called the [[equivalence principle]]).

: My suugestion is to state that "these terms are often treated as being synonymous, but most researchers in the field of gravitational theory distinguish between the two: ..." . --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:53, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:: I don't think there is any significant distinction between the words "gravity" and "gravitation" in the scientific community. Could you please show me that such a distinction actually exists? [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 15:52, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

::: See {{cite book | author=Ohanian, Hans C. & Ruffini, Remo | title=Gravitation and Spacetime (3rd ed.) | location= New York | publisher=W. W. Norton| year=1994 | id={{ISBN|0-393-96501-5}}}} for one.  The authors only mention "gravity" as the "force of gravity".  Otherwise they refer only to gravitation.  Also, amongst my books, {{cite book | author=Wald, Robert M. | authorlink=Robert Wald|title=General Relativity | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year = 1984 | id={{ISBN|0-226-87033-2}}}} only uses the work "gravitation".  The same for {{cite book|title=Gravitation and Relativity|first=M. G|last=Bowler|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1976|id={{ISBN|0-08-020567-4}}}} only uses the word "gravitation".  To top it off, I have taken classes in general relativity at the University of Maryland with the professors in its Gravitation group, and they were very definite about this distinction.
::: I can understand your skepticism.  In classical mechanics there is the force of gravity and the [[law of universal gravitation]].  So I can see why the two words seem to be used interchangeably.  Indeed, the phenomenon and the force are so intertwined that many people don't bother to make the distinction, but I assure you that it is there.  Look at it this way:  If they are not two separate things, then why bother having two separate words? --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

::::What you're telling us about is just your personal experience, and I think only a small fraction of scientists think that such a distinction should be made. My experience shows that the words are used interchangably. You didn't like the search results I presented above. Here is another piece of evidence that is completely against the trend you're defending: probably you heard the expressions [[supergravity]], [[quantum gravity]], [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&q=%22Kaluza-Klein+gravity%22 Kaluza-Klein gravity]. All these terms refer to general relativity or its generalizations, not to Newton's force law, and still these expression almost always use the word "gravity" rather than "gravitation". Therefore, I think the paragraph about the distinction between the two terms isn't [[WP:NPOV]] and should be removed. [[User:Yevgeny Kats|Yevgeny Kats]] 17:48, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

::::: Kaluza-Klein is the only one there which at all contrdicts what I am saying, as the other two are supposing that gravitation is due to an active exchange of [[gravitons]] while GR only admits gravitons as the messenger for changes of spacetime curvature.  Therefore by the rule given above those are indeed theories of gravity (in that they call for gravitation to be due to a force).  Kaluza-Klein was ironically enough an attempt to extend Einstein's paradigm for gravitation to electromagnetism.  (In fact I am getting suspiscious that "Kaluza-Klein gravity" may be a different altenate theory inspired by the work of Kaluza and Klein, or it could just be a misnomer.  However I will admit that the important thing is that it is there.)
::::: You are right that only a small fraction of scientists will make this distinction, but that fraction is the majority of scientists who deal with general relativity.  Please remember that "gravity" really means the "force of gravity".  In classical mechanics "gravity", "force of gravity", and "gravitation" are the same thing.  However, in general relativity, '''gravitation is not due to a force''', but instead to spacetime curvature.  That is when it becomes important to distinguish between the phenomenon and the force, and that is why my experience has called for that distinction to be made.
::::: So a "small fraction" it may be who make that disctinction, but given that it is made by the small fraction who call themseves gravitation researchers, I think that said distinction should be respected here. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:21, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::: Zdravstvuy Yevgeny, if an opinion of Jim the troll counts for anything it is that EMS is perfectly right since "gravitation" is a physical phenomenon while "gravity" is a physical force (non existing BTW as a ''fundamental force'') and that's why I didn't like the first sentence of the "gravitation" page. This setence would be OK in a "gravity" page though since a lot of folks think that "gravity" is a "''fundamental force'' of attraction mediated by gravitons" (they see this force, don't they, like some time ago they saw the Sun going around the earth, and even earlier a flat Earth and the Sun born every day since there was no way for the old one to get from the West to the East). All the experimentalists I know think along these lines. They believe only in what they see. Which is good because it prevents them from believing in good or evil spirits. But, IMHO, the GR is here to stay even if experimentalist hope that they don't have to learn it since "soon" it is going to be replaced by "quantum gravity". Eventually they have to change their opinions since the GR is a fact and ignoring facts is as bad a thing as believing in good and evil spirits. BTW, are you a theorist? [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 13:07, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

::::::: Jim - I thank you for your support on this issue, but not for your continued POV pushing.  IMO, even under GR gravitation acts as an attraction between masses, and so I will leave that first sentence as-is.  (Note that I agree with your reason for wanting to change it even if I don't agree with the change.)  As for quantum gravity:  It is what it is.  I also roll my eyes at it, but [[user:ems57fcva|who am I]] to complain about someone reseaching an alternative to general relativity?  Also, please realize that GR is a theory, not a "fact".  The fact is that GR is well accepted due to its being confirmed by observation.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:24, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::::: EMS - This is what I meant since "facts" are only just results of observations until they are proven wrong by a different theory which interprets those observations differently. "Facts" aren't absolute since "without a theory one can't understand the observations" [Einstein]. E.g. the Sun running around the Earth was once a "fact" but not anymore. So the experimentalist (especially Feynman) have also their point but it becomes valid only when they understand the theory and not when they want to skip GR as "too difficult" (let's better stick to Newton with "corrections") or as "not agreeing with QM" (let's make a brand new theory of "quantum gravity" and forget about curved spacetime). [[User:JimJast|Jim]] 15:35, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

I disagree with those who would want to diminish the distinctions between gravity and gravitation. Please consider the following; in current thinking, when light from a distant star is “bent” (in Euclidean space) as it goes past a massive object, it is in fact going along a “straight” line (in curved space-time) known as a geodesic (which minimizes the “distance” that it travels). According to the general theory of relativity, to say that the light was “attracted” toward the massive object is incorrect. If the light had gone straight in Euclidean space or in any way not followed the geodesic as it passed this massive object, then we could say that it had been attracted and accelerated toward something. Similarly, for the article to say "“Gravitation" is the attractive influence that all objects exert on each other, while "gravity" specifically refers to a force which all massive objects (objects with mass) are theorized to exert on each other to cause gravitation.” rips out and throws away the heart and the central premise of the general theory of relativity which as a theory of gravitation states that there is no force of gravity and that there is no attraction (or acceleration) of bodies due to this force.

== Early Indian gravitational theory ==

{{user|Jagged 85}} edited the start of the "Early history" section to read:

: Since ancient times, there have been many attempts to understand and explain gravity. From the [[8th century BC|8th century BCE]], [[Indian philosophy|philosophers]] in [[ancient India]] may have understood that a form of gravitation held the [[solar system]] together. <nowiki><ref></nowiki>Dick Teresi (2002), ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science - from the Babylonians to the Maya'', [[Simon & Schuster, Inc.|Simon & Schuster]], New York, {{ISBN|0-684-83718-8}}:
:{{quote|"Two hundred years before [[Pythagoras]], philosophers in northern India had understood that gravitation held the solar system together, and that therefore the sun, the most massive object, had to be at its centre."}}
:<nowiki></ref></nowiki> In the [[4th century BCE]], [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] believed that there was no [[effect]] without a [[cause]], and therefore no [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[force]]. He hypothesized that everything tried to move towards its proper place in the crystalline [[sphere]]s of the heavens, and that physical bodies fell toward the center of the [[Earth]] in proportion to their [[weight]].

I find this to be an amazing assertion, especially the indication that it was known that the Sun is much more massive than the Earth.  Most ancient cultures thought that the Sun was small as compared to the Earth.  Even with a heliocentric theory (and the resultant realization that the Sun must be bigger in order to function as the central mass), I see no evidence of a gravitational theory here, but instead a blanket statement that an influence exists.  In any case, more and more scolarly documentation is needed of this business. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 03:10, 12 May 2007 (UTC)

:I've added another quote from an ancient Indian philosopher around that time who tried to explain gravity. I really don't see what's so amazing about this though. It's really not that hard to come up with a gravitational theory of some kind. I wouldn't be surprised if the Egyptians and Babylonians made earlier attempts aswell. As for the heliocentric theory, that's a different issue altogether and doesn't really need to be discussed here, but it just happens to be part of the quote.

== Simplification of Newton's law of gravitation ==

According to this article, "Newton’s law of gravitation simplifies to F = ma". While the F in in the law of gravitation can obviously be usefully equated with the F in F = ma, I do not see how the former equation can be said to "simplify" to the latter. Can anyone clarify what this statement is supposed to mean? Matt 00:32, 10 June 2007 (UTC)
:At one time the article said 'simplifies to F = mg', where m and g are scalars, with g = constant 9.8m/sec/sec. This is Galileo's finding and the basis for the [[Equations for a falling body|law of falling bodies]]. --[[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] 01:20, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
::I don't understand what you're getting at - whether it's written F = mg or F = ma makes no odds. The equation F = ma applies universally. It would (or could) still apply even if gravity didn't obey Newton's inverse-square law. The law of gravitation is a completely different concept. It explains how the force of gravity arises from the masses and distances involved. You cannot get from the law of gravitation to F = ma, or vice versa, just by a process of "simplification". They are, as far as I can see, two completely different things, that can be ''combined'' to work out the acceleration of a falling body, say. That's quite different from "simplification".

::::We're talking at cross-purposes here. I was not quibbling about whether it should be "a" or "g", I was questioning the word "simplify". However, having just read this paragraph again it makes perfect sense - it's just saying that when "r" in the law of gravitation is constant, the formula F = m1*m2*G/r^2 becomes F = m1*g for some suitable constant g.

== WHY do objects exert force on one another? Is this field completely understood, or is it a mystery? ==

Please forgive me if this was adressed in the article, but I couldn't find a specific enough answer within the body of the article.

Why, exactly, does gravity exist? Everyone knows that an object of sufficient enough mass (a planet for instance) will exert a pull on other objects, but why is this? What is it about mass that creates a force? The force of gravity seems to come from nowhere.

Is this "just the way things are" or is there a specific scientific explanation for why mass causes gravity? [[User:EvaXephon|EvaXephon]] 03:30, 11 June 2007 (UTC)
:It's a profound question. Not even Newton could answer it. All he could give was ''what''. The mechanism of gravitation (the ''how'' of gravitation) is current research. The [[Higgs field]] is a potential answer for the origin of [[mass]]. But that only answers ''how''. So we might invert this and say that Newton was smart enough to know he couldn't answer ''why''.

You have asked a great question and aren't going to get many answers. However let's say there are a lot of small particles (gravitons) that are being attracted by gravity into a very small volume of space. but they cant get together because their line of motion isn't aimed at the central point of attraction. So then they kind of mix with each other and acquire a more or less uniform property of angular motion around the central point. Then maybe the central particles of this "particle cloud" manage to "cohere" or achieve fixed positions relative to each other and then grow in size to some volume restriction limit.

== Calculating end of solar system ==

Since the total mass of the sun is known (1.9891 {{e|30}} kg or 332,946 Earths), 99.86% of the Solar System's total, wouldn't it then be possible to calculate were the gravitational influence of the sun ends, in other words: at what distance would an object no longer be pulled into an orbit around the sun?
Currently, the edge of our solar system is only '''estimated''' to end at the [[Oort cloud]], at a distance of about 50,000 [[AU]] from the Sun (1000 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto or nearly a light year).
Why isn't a precise calculation made yet, if possible?

My own opinion is that all objects in the universe exert some influence on all other objects depending on their [[Mass#Gravitational_mass | Gravitational Mass]] and distance. If that were the case, then there would be no true border, only a point where its influence became infinitesimally negligible.

::I'm familiar with the Termination Shock and that image. But as I stated, I want to calculate the endpoint of the Sun's gravitational pull, not were the solor wind ends, it's two different things.

::: Okay for anyone still interested, I found an answer. It is related to the [[Inverse-square law]]; see here: [http://www.solarviews.com/eng/edu/invsquar.htm]
::: at 340km heigth, the [[International Space Station]] experiences only 90.13% of Earth's gravitational pull (''6378,137^2 / 340^2 *1 *100 = 90.13%''). So at 20 million kilometers away from earth, the pull is only 0,00001%. However the line goes very slowly to 0% (actually it never reaches 0% and goes on to infinity!). At [[Mars]], 78 million km from Earth, the pull will still be 0,00000067% so the two planets effect each other's orbits at verry low levels! Now going back to the [[Sun]], the calculation is as follows when observing the distance of [[Pluto]]: ''695000^2 / 5906376272^2 *27,94 *100 = 0,0000014%''. So this number appears verry weak, but still it is enough to get Pluto to orbit around the Sun! The Oord-cloud starts at 20,000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], so the calculated pull is 0,000000000005%. Furthermore, even at the nearest star, [[Proxima centauri]], the Sun still has a gravitational pull of 0,00000000000003%!  Only now I can see the problems of my underlying question: [[n-body problem]]. --[[User:Patrick1982|Patrick1982]] 20:41, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

== Gravitation is the Reason (?) ==

I find the sentence in the introduction "Gravitation is also the reason for the very existence of the Earth, the Sun, and most microscopic objects in the universe; without it, matter would not have coalesced into these large masses and life, as we know it, would not exist." somewhat (not a lot) philosophical and dogmatic.  Anyways, my view would be that matter is infinitely more a reason for the very existence of the Earth, the Sun, etc... and that gravitation plays an important but secondary role.  Maybe I am reading too much into the sentence.  I think it is the “very existence” and the “life … would not exist” parts that get me.  I will admit to a bias that I have; I feel a twinge whenever scientific thought, effort and knowledge is presented as we absolutely (or for that matter, even remotely) know what happened and how the world works as opposed to our best understanding to date is ...  Along the same lines, I do not subscribe to the infallibility of science, scientific theory, and um, scientists (which would include myself).  Irrespective my flaws and bias, I think that the article would be improved if the coalescence of matter and the formation of the Earth, planets, Sun and other macroscopic objects would be added to the existing previous sentence which already lists the things for which (we currently understand) gravitation is (in part) responsible. [[User:AikBkj|AikBkj]] 17:06, 9 November 2007 (UTC)
On the contrary, gravity would have destroyed the earth by making it part of the sun except for the fortuitous circumstance that the mass of the earth managed somehow to retain half of its lost potential energy with respect to the sun's gravitational field and convert that to an orbital velocity around the sun.

== Between 8.4 and 10.6 m/s^2? ==

The article claims that "[the] value [of the strength of the gravitation field] at ''the Earth's surface'', denoted g, is between 8.4 and 10.6 m/s²". I don't think that on the Earth's surface there is any place where it is that strong or that weak. In the [[Earth's gravity]] article, there are values in some cities, ranging from 9.779 m/s^2 in Mexico City to 9.819 in Helsinki and Oslo. On some high mountain near the Equator it'll be even less, and at the North Pole it'll be even more, but definitely not as much/less as 10.6 or 8.4. --[[User:Army1987|Army1987]] 11:06, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

Yea, something odd there.  In the article on [[Earth's gravity]] in the section on Altitude, I noticed this "In reality, the gravitational field peaks within the Earth at the core-mantle boundary where it has a value of 10.7 m/s², because of the marked increase in density at that boundary."  Maybe that's where one of those numbers came from? The core starts at a depth of about 2890 km according to the article on [[Earth]], not exactly part of the Earth's surface.

== Falling Objects and Rates of Acceleration: ==

I didn't see in the article that this point was brought up, but should it be mentioned that heavier objects do in fact fall more quickly than lighter objects?

I can understand the reasoning behind teaching to people who are new to the subject that objects fall at the same rate and will hit the ground at the same time when dropped from the same height. But, being an encyclopedia article, should it not be explained that this is actually a misconception?  Just for technical accuracy, I mean.  It's not really important for the average person to know this, but for those who choose to study gravity in further detail, the teaching that all objects fall to Earth at the same rate regardless of their masses introduces an early misunderstanding that, though such a belief is acceptable for most practical applications, it is actually contrary to the way gravity actually works.

:Please do not post that statement to the article. An astronaut conducted this experiment on the moon. Galileo's experiment holds; Aristotle was wrong and Galileo noted this in 1638.

:When you say that larger objects fall more quickly are you referring to the fact that the Earth is pulled ever so slightly more to the larger object?

::The concept of relative displacement (both objects move) is discussed in the last few sentences in the section "Earth's gravity”. Also, Newton's law of universal gravitation is wikilinked in the section directly following the section on “Scientific revolution” (which mentions air resistance) for those who wish to learn more detail. The existing text would seem to address the concerns of Alexis from what I understand.

::By the way, for technical accuracy, if one (like Galileo) drops two objects of different masses, they will hit the ground closer to the same time than Alexis might think (ignoring air resistance, etc). Consider that the absolute acceleration and absolute displacement of the Earth will be identical for both (since the drops are occurring simultaneously).  The Earth’s motion would be very slightly different only if the drops are done separately and timed. I would agree with Ben’s assessment that this type of detail in the article would be misleading considering the other effects which become important at this level.

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What would happen if you dropped 2 objects, both being the exact same size and shape, but one weight 1 pound on the moon, and the other weighed 10 pounds with no air resistance, then dropped both at the exact same time at the exact same height on exactly leveled ground? I am pretty certain that the 10 pound object will hit the ground first, but I also know that the difference in time will be really short.

My question to myself was, "If someone could jump 100 feet into the air, should that person be able to land the fall without taking any damage? (This is not putting into consideration on how that person lands, or how their internal organs and such move around)... I was trying to find the formula to see how much force would be required from the initial jump as well as the ending impact. I mean, how much force would somebody need to use in order to jump that high to begin with?

:::If you did fall from 30.48 metres (100 feet) from the surface of the moon, after 6.13 seconds of falling you would hit the ground at 9.9 m/s (22 miles per hour). This is the same as falling from 5 metres (16.5 feet) on Earth in terms of the speed at which that you would hit the ground. It is highly likely that you would survive this jump, although you could twist or even break something. People with more mass are more likely to be injured. I'm not an expert on human durability, but if you don't weigh too much, don't have any joint problems, and know the best way to land you should be able to land without taking damage. By the way, the high jump world record holder [[Javier Sotomayor]] would only be able to jump about 15 metres (50 feet) on the moon. The force required to jump a certain distance is dependant upon the weight of the person jumping. You should be able to jump a little more than six times the height you can jump on Earth as long as you aren't burdened by a heavy oxygen tank or space suit. Out of curiosity, what game are you referring to? [[User:Jecowa|Jecowa]] ([[User talk:Jecowa|talk]]) 14:22, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== Contradiction ==

This article says:

:"In scientific usage gravitation and gravity are distinct. "Gravitation" is the attractive influence that all objects exert on each other, while "gravity" specifically refers to a force which all massive objects (objects with mass) are theorized to exert on each other to cause gravitation. Although these terms are interchangeable in everyday use, in theories other than Newton's, gravitation is caused by factors other than gravity. For example in general relativity, gravitation is due to spacetime curvatures which causes inertially moving objects to tend to accelerate towards each other."

However, the [[Fundamental interaction]] article implies throughout that in general relativity gravitation ''is'' a force, and in at least two places it explicitly says so:

:"Gravitation is by far the weakest interaction, but at long distances is the most important force."

:"Thus large celestial bodies such as planets, stars and galaxies dominantly feel gravitational forces"

Something needs fixing here. Matt 14:43, 3 December 2007 (UTC).

:The problem is with points of view. What Newton and Galileo viewed as an influence due to force is due to the geometrical curvature of a 'trajectory' (called a [[geodesic]]) in Einstein's view. So the sentences might be reframed 
:"Gravitation is by far the weakest interaction, but at long distances gravitation is the most important factor (in the motion of objects). Thus large celestial bodies such as planets, stars and galaxies dominantly feel gravitation (rather than the strong, weak or electromagnetic forces)."
:You are touching on an important point, which is about [[inertia]] and how it is defined with respect to a reference frame. For Galileo, 'rest' was obvious, but how do you assert what that means for galaxies, galactic clusters or even larger contexts? --[[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] ([[User talk:Ancheta Wis|talk]]) 23:48, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

::This point relates to a fundamental difference between how gravity is viewed in general relativity (where gravity is not viewed as a force), and how it is viewed in quantum mechanics (where it is, although a force so weak that it's almost always ignored).  
::However, the statement seems to be proposing a distinction in terminology that is not commonly used by actual physicists.  This statement "in theories other than Newton's, gravitation is caused by factors other than gravity" really does not reflect the way that the term is used by physicists, or by anybody else.  It's just not the way the term is used, and I will see if I can rewrite the section to reflect this. [[User:Geoffrey.landis|Geoffrey.landis]] ([[User talk:Geoffrey.landis|talk]]) 03:46, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

:::OK, so we seem to have established that in GR gravity/gravitation definitely isn't a force. So, in addition to the clarifications you have made to this article about the meaning of the terms "gravity" and "gravitation", should the [[Fundamental interactions]] article also be tweaked to make this clearer? That article states at the start that GR is the "current theory" of gravitation, and the implication is that the statements made there about gravitation pertain to the GR viewpoint. So, am I right in thinking that it shouldn't be referred to there as a force -- or there should at least be some caveats? Matt 01:30, 16 December 2007 (UTC).

::::I wish there were a simple answer to this query.  At one level, it's a question of definitions more than a question of real physics: a question of what you chose to define as a force.  In General Relativity, it's convenient in many cases to just pick a freely-falling reference frame, and in that frame the "force" of gravity doesn't exist by definition, and since the GR theory has built into it the techniques to transform into any reference frame, this is straightforward.  You can formulate GR in such a way as to treat gravity as a force-- this is perfectly acceptable, but has the conceptual disadvantage that it ends up with frame-dependent descriptions, which true relativists disdain as inelegant.  In quantum mechanics, though, it's more convenient to deal with gravity, if you ever need to, as a force fundamentally no different than any other.  Certainly in classical mechanics it's straightforward to think of gravity as a force.  (Real physics tends to deal in potentials rather than forces at a fundamental level anyway-- in fact, Mermin argued in ''Physics Today'' that we shouldn't even teach F=ma anyway, we should just go right to potentials).

While it is true that Newton's law is '''''much simpler''''' and sufficient '''''in most cases''''' because it does not require to understand how the gravitational force is generated but a bad part of it is that being simpler it's not true (for the lack of attractive force acting through vacuum). So why wikipedians keep around this sentence instead of explaining how the '''''modern physics''''' explains the gravitational force?

== Conflict between GR and QM ==

The section originally had this line: "Several decades after the discovery of general relativity it was realized that general relativity cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]]".  
This statement implicitly promotes a point of view: the correct statement is that GR and quantum mechanics are incompatible, and hence ''either'' GR is an incomplete theory, ''or'' quantum mechanics is. (or both, of course).  It's quite plausible that it may be possible to reformulate QM in a way to incorporate highly-curves spacetime, and that doing so would solve the problem with no changes in GR.  
I rewrote this section slightly to remove the implied statement that, of the two theories, the one that's in errror is GR, not QM. 
I'm also not at all sure that the formulation of gravity as a force involving virtual exchange of spin-2 gravitons postdates the (rather slow) realization that QM and GR are incompatible at the fundamental level; in fact, without formulating GR in terms of quantum field theory, you can't really show that GR and QM are incompatible, so I removed a handful of words suggesting this timeline.[[User:Geoffrey.landis|Geoffrey.landis]] ([[User talk:Geoffrey.landis|talk]]) 16:06, 4 January 2008 (UTC)



== Re new gravity model ==

Looks like this might be worth reading and mentioning in article: 
<blockquote>
"In a paper in the August 3 online edition of the Institute of Physics' peer-reviewed Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, they put forth the idea that scientists were forced to propose the existence of dark energy and dark matter because they were, and still are, working with incorrect gravitational theory. 

The group suggests an alternative theory of gravity in which dark energy and dark matter are effects – illusions, in a sense – created by the curvature of spacetime (the bending of space and time caused by extremely massive objects, like galaxies). Their theory does not require the existence of dark energy and dark matter. 

“Our proposal implies that the 'correct' theory of gravity may be one based solely on directly observed astronomical data,” said lead author Salvatore Capozziello, a theoretical physicist at the University of Naples, to PhysOrg.com."

== Regarding gravitational space-time bending ==

How does gravity effect space time when there is nothing  ( or near nothing ( vacuum )) in that space-time? 

When looking at gravitational effects specifically when applied to light travelling from distant stars can we be deceived that gravity is constant?  

Does a gravitational field only exist when there is mass in that field, or does its gravitational well exist when there is no matter there?  To take this a step further would it be possible that a gravitational field with respects to space time bending if it has no mass near it?  

Is there an easy experiment to prove this wrong?  ---- (Tommac2|Tommac2)

: Please keep in mind that this is not the appropriate place to ask questions such as this.  This is for discussion of the article itself.

:I believe that your idea has merit.  I have been developing a hypothesis based on an idea similar to this, but because of time constraints I haven't been left the time to develop the mathematics that would be required to back such a strong claim.  Stating this has many implications, such that G is not constant and similar things.

Quote: "it would be Isaac Newton that gave the first correct description of gravity". 

Comment: Galileo's description is correct for phenomena close to the surface of the earth where the acceleration of gravity is constant, just as Newton's description is correct for phenomena at low velocities and weak gravitational fields where the general relativistic corrections are small, and Einstein's description is correct at low energies when quantum phenomena are not important.

== Is Gravity a Property of Space, or a Property of Matter? ==

I'm not much of a math wizard, so I'll ask this question in more mechanical terms. Let's say, hypothetically, if someone could hollow out a room at the very center of the Earth, would he be pulled to the center of its mass, (ie: float in the middle), or would he be pulled toward the mass itself, (be able to walk across all the walls)?

OK, assuming that you answered yes to the first part of my question, gravity is a property of space, I would float in the center of this hypothetical "room" at the center of the Earth. But, unlike the spacestation, because of the Earth's vastly larger mass than my own, it seems to me that I would still be experiencing weight, (in way that would feel more like pressure than weight as we normally experience it). I would be stuck fast at the center, and if someone were to lower a ladder to me, my weight would be a great deal more than it is on the surface. Would this be correct?  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/216.67.92.66|216.67.92.66]] ([[User talk:216.67.92.66|talk]]) 19:35, 11 June 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
When you say center of the earth I assume you mean the gravitational center, which is where all the gravitational force of the surrounding matter balances out. At that point there would would be no net directional gravitational force and thus no weight.WFPM[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 22:41, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

:Gravity is a property of matter moving through space. It arises entirely from the law of conservation of momentum. It exists simply because that's the way matter has moved and will continue to move in accordance with momentum conservation laws. As I see it, there's nothing mysterious about that. As for that "room in the center of the earth", the mass surrounds you from all directions has very little to do with adding to your weight. Much of it will cancel itself and would be far less than what is on the surface.''<u>'''[[User:Kmarinas86|Kmarinas86]]''' <sup>'''[[User_talk:Kmarinas86|(6''sin''8''karma'')]]'''</sup></u> 17:33, 12 June 2008 (UTC)
::Kmarinas86, Thank you for the citation. I quote from it "a mass moving at a constant acceleration does not radiate" which is very similar to the situation for charge at constant velocity.

Thank you for these responses. I agree, there does seem to be a direct corrolation between gravity and motion, (namely, accelleration), possibly linked to the speed of light, I don't know. 

As the article states, General Relativity says that gravity is caused by curvature in spacetime, which is a hard concept for some of us to wrap our heads around. Teachers often use the analogy of a bowling ball on a trampoline to describe the "gravity well", (as a golf ball set on that trampoline will roll toward it). The section on Newton describes how weight decreases in proportion to an objects movement from the "center about which [the Earth] revolves". By this, it seems to me that my weight would increase the closer I get to the bottom of the gravity well, regardless of the amount of mass above me, and "up" would always be "away from center". That implies to me that gravity is a property of the universe interacting with matter. 

The idea that there is a "balancing point", by which at the center I would be pulled equally in all directions, and therefore not pulled at all, tells me that if I were to move slightly off center, an imbalance would be created by which I would be pulled toward the walls of this fictional room. In which case, "up" would no longer be "away from the center", and my weight should actually decrease the deeper I travel into the Earth. Therefore, gravity would be a property of matter interacting with the universe. But I am no expert on the subject. I'm just trying to get a little more of a mechanical explanation, rather than just a mathamatical one. Thanks for the input.

:Gravity is a property of space-time, not space. Mass (actually energy) creates hills and valleys of space in the 4-dimensional space-time universe that Einstein conceived. The center of Earth is the bottom of one such 'space' valley. As you move from the center of earth you move out of that valley; you start going uphill, or more accurately you start going 'up-space' -- accelerating away from the 'space valley'. In the Newtonian frame, you start feeling a force pulling you towards the center as you move away from the center. To continue in the Newtonian (illusory) frame, as you move away from the center of the earth, there becomes more mass behind you than ahead of you so you start to feel a 'gravitational force' pulling you back towards the center. The further away form the center that you get, the stronger becomes this apparent force because the amount of mass behind you keeps increasing and the mass ahead keeps decreasing. (Looking for references to use for this... anyone else got references for this?) -- [[User:Len Raymond|Len Raymond]] ([[User talk:Len Raymond|talk]]) 14:49, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

Thanks, but this view seems to contradict itself. If gravity is caused by "hills and valleys in spacetime", then wouldn't all matter within the Earth's gravitational field only add to that field, in a direction that would cause matter to be pulled to the center with an increasing degree of curvature until reaching the bottom of the well. Then Newton's math should still work, (in reverse of course), all the way to the bottom, which would make the center of the Earth a singularity of such, (no, not a black hole), but in the way that all directions from the center would be up?

:As I move towards the center, the mass behind me keeps increasing and the mass ahead keeps decreasing. This causes the curvature to get flatter (decrease, not increase). At the center, the curvature becomes completely flat (weightless) -- zero gravity in the Newtonian model. Realize that matter adds in a localized, directional fashion to the gravity field. When you stick a clump of matter to the side of a ball the curvature increases towards the point at which you added the clump, not towards the point at the (old) center of the ball. Important note: Adding this mass actually shifts the center of mass -- towards the added clump -- so the old center-of-mass no longer has zero G's. The old center now has a slight gravity pull towards the new center. Your room analogy has a another issue. To simplify, imagine one inside a hallow ball. In that case, a single piece of loose matter (such as a yourself inside the ball) would, I expect, be 'attracted' to the matter in the wall -- net effect: there is a small gravitational effect towards the nearest wall (towards the nearest matter). But the Earth is not hallow. Any point in the Earth is fully packeted with matter on all sides, all exerting a 'pull'. The net effect: The side of you that is surrounded by the most mass is the side one is 'pulled' towards unless, of course, you are at the center of mass where all sides pull equally.  -- [[User:Len Raymond|Len Raymond]] ([[User talk:Len Raymond|talk]]) 13:48, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

I'm not sure this is the proper place for a discussion on the subject. I just thought my question seemed rather simple. "Pulled toward center, or pulled toward the mass?" There should be some easy experiments that would show this, (ie: an atomic clock/deep cave experiment, or a drop of mercury in a space at the center of a large lead ball, while free falling).

== ??? ==

There are some people who believe that gravity dose not exist and that there is some logical explanation for the planets to be orbiting the sun and for us to come back down when we jump there is even an explanation for why we even stay on the ground.
The planets are able to stay in orbit around the sun because space is like a trampoline pulled tight and you can imagine the planets to be like ants.  Now if you were to drop a bowling ball (sun) onto the "trampoline" it would make the "trampoline" have a hole like imprint.  Now if the "ants" were to come anywhere near the "bowling ball" they would slide towards it.  This is how I believe the planets stay in orbit.  For more info check out the book: "The Quantum Zoo: A Tourists Guide To The Never Ending Universe"  By: Marcus Chown.
When we jump we come back down because the Earth's core is made up of what most people think is hot, molten lava and this lava pushes against the underside of the Earth's surface now when we jump we are in free fall for a small amount of time and since the Earth is blocking our path to continue we land on it.  We stay on the Earth's surface because we are pushing against the lava on the inside.  This is what causes us to stay on the surface of the Earth. 
You must remember that this is just a theory and it can be incorrect or correct and the same goes for the theory of gravity existing.

:What you describe sounds like an analogy that is often used to qualitatively describe the relationship between [[spacetime curvature]] and orbits in [[General Relativity]].

== Gravity: Energy? ==

If you pass a magnetic object through a coil you produce an electric current, correct? It is basis of traditional generators. But what if the driving force for said generator was gravity.

Now, hypothetically speaking, if you constructed a coil of truly colossal dimensions and placed it around the earth (or a simmilar body), and then placed in orbit an object with magnetic qualities in such a way that it grew no closer or further from the earth, and said object orbited within the coil, wouldent you have on your hand a generator run purely by gravitation?

If gravity is NOT energy, then this senario defys the conservation of energy, but I cant see why it wouldn't work. If gravity IS a form of energy, then that is one enormous and non poluting souce of power...

Call me a Quack or call me a Genious, I just want to know if this would work.--[[User:Hsan007|Hsan007]] ([[User talk:Hsan007|talk]]) 07:46, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

:If you drop a magnet through a coil straight down, yes you can get an induced current.  You are transferring some of the gravitational potential energy of the magnet into electrical energy. However, there is a problem with the situation you propose. The only reason that an object stays in orbit is that no energy is being lost. There are no resistive forces acting. In the situation you present, the magnet would continually feel resistive magnetic forces as it passes through the coils, causing a relatively rapid decay of orbit.  The energy gained by it passing through the coils would not equal the energy it cost to put it in orbit to begin with. So this would not work as an energy source.

== Opening sentence ==

''Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all objects with mass attract each other in a way that conserves angular momentum, and is one of the fundamental forces of physics.''

To me, the fact that gravity conserves angular momentum is a subsidiary point that should not be mentioned in the opening sentence. The prominence of this detail here is likely to just raise unnecessary doubts in the reader's mind. It almost sounds as if the definition is distinguishing gravity from other phenomena that cause objects with mass to attract each other but which happen not to conserve angular momentum. Angular momentum is always conserved, so it's no big deal (at this point in the article) that gravity does also.

If you are a universe designer and want to put a quantity of matter (mass) into an existing physical system there are a number of associated physical properties of the matter that you need to specify in order to adequately include it. There's position, and velocity, and direction, and any forces and/or force differencials per unit direction that you know about, plus the unknown potential future activities of the universe and/or any of its subsidiaries.

== Opening statement revisited ==

''Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass attract one another.''

The above statement is false. What I propose instead is to make it true by stating ''Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass '''look like attracting''' one another''. Then, besides possibly awaking the curiosity why they ''look like attracting one another'', there is a room for explaining why in the real world they ''don't attract one another'' but only ''look like they do''. Room for explaining why the whole Newtonian gravitation is just a magic, pure math without much physics behind it even if it is taught in physics classes. Otherwise we may be forced at some point to have to admit that we knew that they don't attract one another and that we were simply lying.

"Attraction" is an illusion that people still use to "explain" gravitational phenomena to people they consider dummies. Phenomena that are a bit more complex than a simple attraction but considered by some professors too complex to be explained to "dummies" like high school kids. They turn out to be too complex mostly to those professors who don't understand them themselves. My survey among professors indicated that none of them was able to explain the true mechanism of gravitatonal force despite their scientific degrees in physics. Yet all of them knew it isn't attraction.

The main difference between reality and attraction is that attraction acts at the distance while in reality the "gravitational action at the distance" is mediated by the curvature of spacetime in which the important thing is the local ''[[curvature of space]]''. In flat space there wouldn't be any gravitation. Ironically, the Newtonian gravitation is a theory in which space is flat. In the real gravitation though (not just in a magical mathematical theory that simulates the real thing) the '''spacetime''' may be flat and the '''space''' must be curved to produce gravitational effects (it also makes the whole theory simpler by allowing a flat spacetime).

The whole confusion about gravitation comes from the fact that despite that in the Newtonian gravitation the space is flat there is something called ''[[gravitational time dilation]]'' that saves the Newtonian gravitation from being completely wrong. So it is only half wrong by missing the curvature of space. And that's why it is not exact. Since the curvature of space acts visibly only when velocities are near speed of light or masses are real big (many orders of magnitude bigger than what we see around in our solar system). Otherwise it acts ''[[behind the scene]]'' to cause gravitational time dilation to make those gravitational phenomena that we may see happening.

That's why it is important to understand the real gravitation before writing articles for high school kids. They may never know more physics than it can be found in wikipedia. So they shouldn't learn as [[physics]] things that are merely [[figures of speech]].

The objection to "attract" is valid.

This is false. Curvature of spacetime does not cause inertially moving objects to accelerate. That doesn't even make sense: how could things be inertial and non-inertial at the same time? Objects that travel along the geodesics of spacetime are, and will always be, inertial. Space-time tells matter how to move. If you throw an apple in the air, it follows its geodesic as it rises and falls; it falls because space-time is curved. Of course, you've just observed the curving of space-time. Why does the falling apple accelerate? That's because relative to you, the non-inertial observer (on the ground being exerted by an upward force, thus upward proper acceleration), the inertial apple (along the geodesics) '''seems''' to accelerate. If we undergo a transformation of reference frame, an inertial observer will see the falling apple traveling at constant velocity in curved space-time (refer to the free-falling elevator experiment). In other words, since the observer is non-inertial and the object is inertial, there is an observable acceleration. That's the point of relativity; motion is relative.

Therefore, this sentence needs to be changed. For me, it should be written as: "By contrast, gravitation, in general relativity, is defined as the curvature of space-time which governs the motion of inertial objects."

---Let's Change this scenario to the case of the hammer versus the feather experiment carried out on the moon. The astraunaut releases the hammer and the feather above the moon's surface. You say the hammer and the feather then become inertial but the moon and the rest isn't. I contest that. What we have now are two independent inertial systems. And the the question becomes as to which system is being accelerated. And why do you vote for the massive moon versus the hammer and the feather?

:Hi, [[User:WFPM|WFPM]]: I am afraid you did not really understand my previous comment. Your example still does not prove how curvature of spacetime can cause acceleration. The geometry of spacetime tells matter how to move; things fall because spacetime is curved. The golf ball and the feather are inertial because they are following the geodesics of space-time, but, relative to the non-inertial astronaut (noninertial due to upward proper acceleration by an upward force on the ground), both the golf ball and the feather are seen accelerating. '''Motion is relative''': do you understand that? Both objects hits the ground at the same time due to the lack of drag on the moon. Guess what? Attach an accelerometer on both falling objects and it reads zero acceleration. Attach one on the astronaut standing on the ground and it reads a value. For your question, the observer in both systems are non-inertial (accelerating upward), but the falling objects are not. General relativity states that force of gravity does not exist, thus, since the falling objects are not affected by such force, they are inertial. General relativity also states that objects follow the geodesics of spacetime unless there is a force applied. It has nothing to do with the systems being accelerated. Relative, remember, relative. Now, why do both observers not shooting up into the sky due to the upward acceleration while standing? Curvature of spacetime. Why are both objects inertial and the rest are not (your question)? As stated before, the objects are following geodesics but the astronauts are not due to the mechanical resistance of the moon (thus, upward force). Is the moon accelerating around the Earth? Yes, relative to a non-inertial observer. Since the moon is basically traveling along the geodesics of the Earth's curved space-time (circling by following the geodesics around it, bringing it back to the same point), the moon's orbital motion is inertial. Unless, you want to argue that following geodesics is not classified as an inertial motion.

:"And the net unbalanced accelerating force on the loose (inertial) golf ball and feather entities" ...??

:Curvature of spacetime does not cause objects to accelerate. Rather, it causes objects to fall or orbit, for example. I still believe my sentence makes more sense: "By contrast, gravitation, in general relativity, is defined as the curvature of space-time which governs the motion of inertial objects."

---Let's see, an accelerometer consists of a lightly restrained mass inside a box with a capabillity of measuring the relative spacial acceleration of the mass with respect to the box, or vice versa And you say that while I'm holding the box steady it will still register the existence of an acceleration. But when I release the box and it begins to presumably fall, the mass will be displaced from its original position and change to a new position that you choose to call the "zero acceleration position". So far so good. Now when we get to the end of this experiment we need to find out what entity there is that has acquired the kinetic energy that was released therein, and we will find that it was acquired by the so called "inertial mass" inside the instrument. Which leads me to the conclusion that it was the inertial mass that was being accelerated thereby towards the center of the local gravitational mass system, which was the moon.

:Hi, [[User:WFPM|WFPM]]:In General Relativity, we are not accelerating down; we are accelerating up on the ground. Falling objects are inertial because they are following geodesics of space-time. Thus, in our frame of reference, the falling objects are seen accelerating as motion is relative. It is a mistake to think that "since the geodesics are 'curved', there has to be acceleration." Hold an apple in mid-air and there is an upward force (exerted by you) to prevent it from falling. Now, why does the apple not accelerate up because of the upward force? That's not because you are holding it, but because spacetime is '''curved'''; the path of the apple is basically circling around the geometry of curved spacetime. This brings the apple back to the same point.

:Now, throw the apple straight up. The apple rises and falls because the shape of spacetime influences the path of the apple. http://fy.chalmers.se/~rico/Theses/tesx.pdf Chp 2.4-2.6 explains it quite clearly of the whole apple scenario (Oh, "a picture explains a thousand words" [http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r36/Persistenxe/CURVED_SPACETIME_111.jpg the path of the apple in curved spacetime]). The geometry of spacetime is a very important concept. The moon's orbit is another example of how the geometry of spacetime governs our motion. No matter how fast it orbits, the geodesics in spacetime will eventually bring the moon back to the same point in space (circling along the geodesics around the Earth).

I have to agree with Persistent76 - while it is completely reasonable to use the mantra "Matter tells spacetime how to curve, spacetime tells matter how to move", it is vital to avoid saying that curvature ''accelerates'' objects.  This can cause confusion since, as Persistent has already said above, you must consider ''proper'' acceleration in General Relativity, which is zero when following a geodesic.  This consistency of definition has to maintained across the site or it will cause people to misunderstand basic notions of relative motion and the concepts of what an inertial and non-inertial observer are.  I support the re-wording as suggested by Persistent76.

:Hi, [[User:WFPM|WFPM]]:This "I and the earth are accelerating upwards and watching a stationary ball", but it is actually not "stationary".

:: Let's consider this as an energy conversion process. A massive system is involved in a gravitational interaction with a small constituent thereof (lets say a released accelerometer). The result of this 
process is for the constituents of the combined system to acquire the increased kinetic energy (delta v squared) as the result of the process. And science tells us that in an interchange of an equal amount on momentum between a large and a small mass, the small mass always does most of the accelerating and gets the vast majority of the increase in kinetic energy.

== Alternative Gravity Theory ==

This is a new theory published in a physics journal... just a month early. I have not violated any policy by posting it as I wrote without personal views and keep on topics discussed in the theory. There is no reason this should be removed when it is a legitimate paper. [[User:Slipinski|Slipinski]] ([[User talk:Slipinski|talk]]) 20:44, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

:First of all, as the author of the paper, you should defer to the judgment of other editors to decide whether the new theory belongs in the article.  As I see it, there are three things that count against the inclusion of this in the article.  First of all, the paper appears in a fairly obscure physics journal.  Secondly, the author is not an especially notable physicist.  Third, there are apparently no physics reviews (or any third-party treatment) of this "new theory".  Now, in terms of policy, Wikipedia strictly discourages dissemination of [[WP:OR|original research]].  Everything an article reports should have appeared elsewhere, and ideally in multiple third-party sources.  Another item to consider is [[WP:WEIGHT]].  There are hundreds if not thousands of "alternative theories", many published, most unpublished, of varying degrees of plausibility.  What you need to establish is that your theory has received on the same order of magnitude of discussion as some of the other theories listed here, such as [[Brans-Dicke theory]], [[MOND]], [[Heim theory]], or the Rosen bi-metric theory.  However, [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=iceweasel-a&rls=org.debian%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&q=Lipinski+%22mass+energy+equivalence%22&btnG=Search as far as I can tell] there has been zero third-party coverage of this.

As far as your first two points I am not concerned with them as this is published in a peer reviewed physics journal. Additionally, if you would take the time to check it out, this theory meets all the same rigorous tests as GR and even has a derivation of the Coulomb force which is not present in any other gravity theory. There are third person reviews, however they have requested to remain anonymous so my hands are tied. However the fact remains this theory can complete all the GR tests including the binary pulsars. Once again I state I am in no violation of policy as this theory is equal to GR in the experimental tests. [[User:Slipinski|Slipinski]] ([[User talk:Slipinski|talk]]) 21:16, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

And I appreciate that new theories displace old - for many years general relativity was held to be the last word. So was Newtonian mechanics.

Some physics journals must publish anything they come across.)

They appear to be moving faster in respect to a stationary observer outside the galixy, but their local time frame appears to them unchanged. i.e. They see no effect due to dark matter.

== Did Newton predict gravitational lensing, and did Eddington refute Newton and confirm Einstein ? ==

;Was the prediction of gravitational lensing historically novel to Einstein's theory of gravity and did the 1919 Eddington eclipse experiments really confirm Einstein's GTR against Newton ?

In its Section 1.3 ‘General relativity’ section the article currently claims

"General relativity has enjoyed much success because of how its predictions of phenomena which are not called for by the theory of gravity have been regularly confirmed. For example:
...
The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by Arthur Eddington in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a quasar which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth."

And indeed it is a standard claim of positivist history of science that (i) Einstein's GTR made a historically novel prediction of gravitational lensing and (ii) that Eddington's 1919 eclipse experiments on Principe and Sobral then confirmed it.

However, in the first instance, contrary to the above claim, gravitational lensing is called for by the Newtonian theory of gravity insofar as it is obviously also predicted by any corpuscular theory of light, such as Newton's, and actually was predicted in the early 19th century. 

Moreover a Newtonian gravitation prediction of a solar bending of starlight was also made for the 1919 eclipse experiments, namely a deflection of 0.87", whilst Einstein's theory predicted a deflection of 1.74".

But secondly, on the evidence of Earman & Glymour's 1980 paper ''Relativity and Eclipses: The British Eclipse Expeditions of 1919 and Their Predecessors'' in '''Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences''', 11, pp. 49-85, either the outcome of the readings of all three telescopic instruments in the 1919 eclipse experiments on Principe and Sobral confirmed both the Newtonian and Einsteinian predictions of bending within experimental error, or else on the best result, which was obtained on Sobral, it refuted them both. Earman & Glymour write as follows:

"The natural conclusion from these results is that gravity definitely affects light, and that the gravitational deflection at the limb of the sun is somewhere between a little below 0.87" and a little above 2.0". <cite id=alldata>If one kept the data from all three instruments, the best estimate of the deflection would have to be somewhere between the Newtonian value and the Einstein value.</cite> If one kept only the results of the Sobral 4-inch instrument [whose plates are unequivocally the best], the best estimate of the deflection would be 1.98", significantly above even Einstein's value. The conclusion that the Astronomer Royal announced...on November 6, 1919, was stronger: Einstein's prediction had been confirmed." [p76 Earman & Glymour 1980]

Thus I hereby flag the article's claim that the 1919 eclipse experiments confirmed Einstein against Newton, at least for further clarification ''pro tem'', and for eventual removal if it cannot be substantiated.

“Thus the results of the expeditions to Sobral and Principe can leave little doubt that a deflection of light takes place in the neighbourhood of the sun and that it is of the amount demanded by Einstein's generalised theory of relativity, as attributable to the sun's gravitational field."

was clearly invalid in respect of its second conjunct on the basis of its declared 1.98” +- 0.12 best outcome and GTR’s 1.75” prediction, at least if you can agree that 1.98 – 0.12 = 1.86 and that 1.75 < 1.86 ?

This refutation is also evident from Weinberg’s bizarre statement you quote, which throws in the less satisfactory Principe result claimed in the 1920 paper as follows

“About a dozen stars in all were studied, and yielded values 1.98 ± 0.11" and 1.61 ± 0.31", in substantial agreement with Einstein's prediction θʘ = 1.75"."

But the first result he states clearly refuted the GTR prediction. The single relatively unreliable Principe result here was the only one that refuted Newton but confirmed GTR. 

Do we have a classical case here of Feyerabend’s thesis that modern physics frequently interprets refutations as confirmations ?

By the way, what is the basis in the 1920 paper, if any, for your apparently mistaken earlier 25 November claim above that "It seems the above Earman & Glymour quote may have missed some of the context.  Apparently the data from the Sobral observatory was excluded because of several systematic errors." ?

I provisionally conclude from this that the claim that Eddington's eclipse experiment refuted Newton but confirmed Einstein is mistaken and must be deleted. This is in addition to the fact that it must be deleted from where it is because it was clearly not an example of a phenomenon that was not predicted by Newtonian theory. --[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 20:02, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

:I reject your preliminary conclusion, as it is entirely based on [[WP:OR|original research]].  The conclusion of the Eddington ''et al'' paper is one made by three of the most eminent astronomers of the era.  The Weinberg quote establishes that these results have been accepted by the mainstream of the modern physics community as confirmatory of the predictions of the general theory of relativity.  Surely other such quotes can be produced, if you would care to consult your local library.  As I have already indicated, the results of the Sobral astrographic plates were rejected (contrary to your inexplicable claim that this was mistaken).  From Eddington ''et al''; e.g., p. 331: "There remain the Sobral astrographic plates which gave the deflection of 0".93 discordant by an amount much beyond the limits of its accidental error.  For the reasons already described, not much weight is attached to this determination." Finally, the quote from Earman & Glymour is quite weak, since it is in the form of a conditional.  I could truthfully say, "If it were the case that 1=0, then all pigs would have wings" without lending any weight to either the antecedent or the consequent of such a statement.  You are free to "provisionally conclude" whatever suits your fancy.  But before you make changes to the article based on your conclusion, may I suggest that you solicit more outside input on the matter?  An RfC may help to bring in more expert input.

:Cutting to the chase. It is quite public knowledge that the actual data of the 1919 expedition didn't quite back up the strong conclusions made by Eddington et al. (it is for example mentioned in Sean Carroll's ''Spacetime and Geometry'' on page 292) The trouble is with the fact the Eddington quite arbitrarily deleted data points as being 'systematic errors' in order to obtain his result. This is (literally!) a textbook example of bad science.
:That being said Eddington's results have since then been confirmed many times by much more precise measurements, that completely refute the Newtonian theory, while agreeing with GR.

They could have discussed their reservation about that point in the article. But the final conclusion of their paper should have been that the result was indicative of Einstainian GR, but not conclusive and that better measurements where warrented. Instead they jumped the gun and declared that there result decisively confirmed GR. That is bad science by today's standard.

::'''Logicus on just one quick logical point:''' Before we sort out the issue of whether or not Eddington 1919 confirmed Einstein AND also refuted Newton and how to express the outcome, the prior more basic question raised in the next discussion topic is whether gravitational lensing was a phenomenon not predicted by Newtonian theory as the article currently claims it was, and thus an example of a phenomenon to be included in this list of such phenomena. Since the phenomenon was also predicted by Newtonian theory, as the 1920 Dyson ''et al'' paper makes abundantly clear on its very first page, it must therefore be deleted from this particular list. Discussion of it may of course and indeed should be included elsewhere, with the invaluable contributions of TimothyRias.

::::'''Logicus to Silly''': Contrary to your implication, no incivility was committed nor intended here. To refer to points as ‘invalid’ is not to be uncivil anymore than describing an argument as invalid is. For example, my provisional conclusion was not based “entirely on original research” as you claim it was, if indeed at all,  but at least partly on the Weinberg secondary source that you quote. Thus at least this point of yours was invalid, as are many others. Such as, for another example, your 25 November claim that

::::“Apparently the data from the Sobral observatory was excluded because of several systematic errors.”

::::Which is apparently flatly contradicted and invalidated by the very first sentence of the ‘General Conclusions’ section of the 1920 paper on its page 330, which is as follows:

::::“In summarising the results of the two expeditions, the greatest weight must be attached to those obtained with the 4-inch lense at Sobral. “

'''Logicus's summary of the discussion:'''

I propose the outcome of the foregoing learned discussion and its referenced literature on whether the Eddington eclipse experiments on gravitational lensing confirmed the GTR prediction of a 1.75" deflection and refuted the Newtonian prediction of a 0.87" deflection may be summarised as follows.

(The Sobral1 and Sobral2 results refer to those of the Sobral 4-inch and Sobral 13-inch telescopes respectively.)

The Sobral1 result of 1.98" +- 0.12" refuted both the Newtonian and GTR predictions, but obviously the latter much less so. This was the most reliable result. The Principe result of 1.61" +- 0.3" confirmed GTR and refuted Newton. The Sobral2 result of 0.93" refuted GTR and confirmed Newton.

The Principe result was the only one that confirmed GTR and refuted Newton. 

As Earman and Glymour [1980] point out, the joint range of all three results confirmed both GTR and Newton, and the most reliable result - Sobral1 - refuted both of them.

The stated conclusion of the 1920 Dyson, Eddington & Davidson Royal Society paper was that the Sobral1 and Principe results confirmed GTR and refuted Newton, thus both discounting the Sobral2 result, and also interpreting the Sobral1 refutation of GTR as a confirmation of it against Newton, presumably turning a refutation into a confirmation because it was a much better approximation than the Newtonian prediction, in spite of being refuted. 

So the 1920 Royal Society paper understandably created the impression of illegitimate cherry-picking of experimental results and interpretations that confirmed GTR. So whilst the outcomes of the Eddington eclipse experiments were regarded as confirming gravitational lensing, on the other hand it seems they were regarded as indecisive as crucial experiments that decided between GTR and Newtonian theory. Thus they cannot be counted as experiments whose estimated outcomes would have justified the acceptance of GTR and the rejection of the Newtonian theory of gravity in 1920. 

But subsequent computer analysis of the Sobral2 data by Greenwich Royal Observatory in 1978 corrected its result to 1.55" +- 0.34" [See Minkel's article in ''Scientific American'' 6 March 2008.]. Hence on this analysis all three results had refuted Newton, two of them had in fact confirmed GTR (Principe & Sobral2), and the most reliable refuted GTR and also Newton (Sobral1). And the whole range of all three results now confirmed the GTR prediction and refuted the Newtonian prediction.

However, it seems that by 1978 GTR was already generally accepted as replacing the Newtonian theory of gravity.

Hence in conclusion, whilst the Eddington eclipse experiments confirmed gravitational lensing in 1919, they were not amongst those experiments whose outcomes should have caused the rejection of the Newtonian theory of gravity in favour of the general acceptance of GTR by the scientific community since they were indecisive on that particular issue. Nor has any evidence been presented that they actually did so at that time, or that GTR replaced Newtonian gravity theory in the 1920s.

It remains to determine (from the literature) by when at least the majority conversion of the scientific community from Newtonian gravity theory to GTR occurred, and what experimental result(s), if any, caused that conversion. By what date did the Newtonian theory of gravity come to be largely regarded as refuted by experiment and GTR as confirmed by experiment ? And by what experiment(s) ? The literature seems to imply the range of this date lies somewhere between 1915 and 1975. 

This must be established to determine whether the article’s following methodologically interesting current claim is true or not:

“General relativity has enjoyed much success because it predicted new phenomena that other theories of gravitation could not account for,…”
 
if “has enjoyed much success” means ‘has been largely accepted  by the scientific community’.

Incidentally it is by way perhaps noteworthy that the 1920 paper made no account nor even any mention whatever of any lunar gravitational deflection, which might presumably have increased the deflection, but only of the solar deflection ? Was its presumption  maybe that lunar deflection would be wholly insignificant ?

In practical conclusion, as things stand both the 1919 gravitational lensing and the precession of Mercury's perihelion must be deleted from the current list of novel phenomena that caused the general acceptance of GTR.

'''Logicus:''' The following summary conclusion of the outcome of the Eddington eclipse experiments in the highly regarded ''A History of Mechanics'' by Rene Dugas  is surely worthy of mention in support of their relative inconclusiveness:
  
"However, several astronomers discussed these experiments and gave contradictory interpretations of them. In the same way the measurements made by Campbell and Trumpler during the eclipse of 21 September 1922 were not considered unanimously conclusive."

'''David Wilson'''
::The problem with ''Wikipedia's'' claiming that General Relativity was confirmed by the results reported in the [1920 Dyson ''et al''] paper is ''not'' to do with any supposed unreliability of the source, but with the [[WP:NPOV|neutrality of that point of view]].  Unfortunately, the claim has been challenged by other sources which also clearly satisfy Wikipedia's criteria for [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].  I say "unfortunately" here, because I happen to agree with you that the analysis of Earman and Glymour's reported by '''Logicus''' doesn't appear to stand up to scrutiny.  At the risk of polluting this talk page with some [[WP:OR|original research]] of my own I will point out that the significance of the differences between the General Relativistic predictions and the experimental results reported in the paper of Dyson et al. are even ''less'' than [[#rusliksig|what you have concluded above]].
::The error bounds given in the paper were ''not'' estimated standard deviations as you have surmised, but estimated ''probable errors''&mdash;i.e. estimated differences between the limits of a 50% confidence interval about the experimental result and the result itself.  If the errors were normally distributed, the probable error would only be 0.674 of a standard deviation.  This means that the actual estimate for the standard deviation of the experimental result from the 4-inch Sobral telescope, for instance, is 0.178" rather than 0.12".  Thus, a two-tailed significance test of the discrepancy between the prediction and the experimental estimate gives a p-value of 0.196.  I'm aware of no circumstances under which any texts on statistics or experimental method have recommend regarding such a high p-value as being "significant".  In my opinion, a p-value of 0.196 indicates at least a "fair" agreement between the prediction and the experimental result, and I wouldn't argue with anyone who wanted to describe it as "satisfactory".

:::I can't resist also pointing out that if one ignores the suspicions of Dyson et al. that the results from the Sobral astrographic telescope had been vitiated by systematic errors, then a reasonable statistical analysis of all three results shows that the agreement between those results and Einstein's prediction turns out to be excellent.  Contrary to the [[#alldata|claim of Earman and Glymour's]] quoted by '''Logicus''' above:
::::"If one kept the data from all three instruments, the best estimate of the deflection would have to be somewhere between the Newtonian value and the Einstein value."
:::the maximum likelihood estimate of the deflection, based on all three experimental results, is actually 1.817" with an estimated standard deviation of 0.152".  Two-tailed tests of significance of the discrepancies between this estimate and the Einsteinian and Newtonian predictions give p-values of 0.668 and 1.3 x 10<sup>-9</sup> respectively.  So if there were in fact ''no'' systematic errors in the data, the experimental results would actually be in ''excellent'' agreement with Einsteinian prediction and decisively refute the Newtonian.  The sum of squares of <s>the</s> <u>appropriately</u> normalised differences between the maximum likelihood estimate and the three experimentally determined estimates is <s>5.01</s> <u>5.66</u>.  If there are no systematic errors, this should be (at least approximately) distributed as a &chi;<sup>2</sup> with <s>three</s> <u>two</u> degrees of freedom, giving a p-value of <s>0.17</s> <u>0.06</u> for a right-tailed test of the significance of the discrepancy.

== Not all the GTR novel predictions listed were of previously unpredicted novel phenomena ==

Since the article presents GTR as a theory of gravity, which maintains gravity is not a force but rather a spacetime curvature, its following current claim is therefore illogical nonsense

"General relativity has enjoyed much success because of how its predictions of phenomena which are not called for by the theory of gravity have been regularly confirmed."

because gravitational lensing was predicted by the Einsteinian theory of gravity, and so presumably it should be and was intended to mean

'General relativity has enjoyed much success because of how its predictions of phenomena which are not predicted by the Newtonian theory of gravity (or any other competing theories of gravity) have been confirmed.'

But then at least the case of gravitational lensing must be deleted from the following stated examples of such, since it is a phenomenon that was also predicted by Newtonian theory with a corpuscular theory of light.

Thus I propose to edit this text as rationalised here, and also to delete the invalid example of gravitational lensing, which could possibly be cited elsewhere as a crucial experiment between Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity theory, if indeed it can be documented that it was i.e. that Einstein was confirmed and Newton refuted. (But it has not yet been documented that it was.)

The example of the perihelion precession of Mercury must also be deleted since that phenomenon was also predicted by Newtonian theory, but just not as completely.

This thus leaves 4 examples of phenomena allegedly not predicted nor explained by Newtonian theory in any way, but at least successfully explained or even predicted by GTR.

But surely the expansion of the universe was no more predicted by GTR, with its cosmological constant, than it was by Newtonian theory, to whose cosmology it also offered a solution to the problem of cosmological gravitational collapse in a 'Big Crunch' ?

I implement these proposed edits for consideration or improvement.

:[[Black_hole#Newtonian_theories]]- in Newtonian mechanics light was thought to be massless. But IRC even if you assume that it is massive, then you get the wrong degree of distortion, and so Newton is still denied by the starlight experiment.- ([[User:Wolfkeeper|User]]) '''Wolfkeeper''' ([[User_talk:Wolfkeeper|Talk]]) 02:28, 9 December 2008 (UTC)

::'''Logicus to Wolfkeeper''': I do not understand your comment and its logical relevance. The issue here is whether the prediction of gravitational lensing was a uniquely historical novel prediction of GTR, but which in fact it was not because it was also predicted by Newtonian theory. The issue as claimed in the article is not that of whether one theory predicted the gravitational deflection more accurately or had its quantiative prediction refuted or not, but rather whether it predicted this kind of phenomenon at all. (Positivist history of science, such as usually indulged in by Wikipedia, has traditionally misrepresented Newtonian theory as not even ever predicting gravitational lensing at all, including nor in the Eddington experiment, and therefore GTR being confirmed merely by virtue of predicting it and the fact that at least one of the three results confirmed the GTR 1.75” deflection prediction, if refuted by the other two.)

::The wider issue of scientific method raised here is whether historical theory change in the relevant scientific community is indeed solely due to the new theory making absolutely novel predictions, that is, of a kind of phenomenon never before observed nor even predicted, which are successfully confirmed (i.e. the methodology of theory change apparently adopted by Wikipedia here), OR or may theory change result just from the successful prediction of already known or already predicted phenomena, such as the precession of Mercury’s perihelion already known and predicted (arguably even since the 1713 Principia second edition with its revised prediction of moving aphelia of the inner planets) and indeed already largely explained albeit not completely by Newtonian theory.

::Thus should the conversion of the scientific community to GTR have occurred in 1916 with its successful complete explanation of the precession of Mercury’s perihelion, or at least by 1919 in having greater success in explaining gravitational lensing also predicted by Newtonian theory, or should it have occurred much later with the confirmation of some absolutely novel phenomenon not predicted by any other theory ? And as a matter of fact, when was the conversion of at least a majority of the scientific community from Newtonian gravity theory to GTR ? Was it even as late as post 1960 as such as Kuhn seem to imply ?

::These issues are of central importance to Wikipedia’s accounts of the scientific method of ‘modern science’ in other articles as being empirical and theory change as being determined by experimental facts. If so, the question then arises of what kind of experimental facts cause theory change e.g. only historically novel experimental facts or also new explanations of old experimental facts ?

::: I must refute your claims. You clearly have misunderstood the papers that you read:
:::: 1) Newton theory made no prediction whatsoever about bending of electromagnetic radiation. I must stress this words&mdash;electromagnetic radiation. And it was known well before GR that light was just an form of electromagnetic radiation. It was also known that Newtonian mechanics was incompatible with classical electrodynamics (this led to creation of special relativity). Therefore Newtonian mechanics strictly speaking was unable to make any predictions about the light deflection. As to the corpuscular theory of light, it had been rejected long before 1920, and nobody seriously considered it as a valid theory.
:::: 2) <cite id=rusliksig>You misunderstands the meaning of the precision in scientific experiment. ±0.11” is just 1σ. If the difference between the experiment and theory exceeds 1σ, it does not mean that the theory is refuted. 1σ is not a rigid barrier. So the difference between 1.74” and 1.98”, which about 2.5σ is not very significant.</cite> However the difference between 0.87 and 1.98 (about 11σ) is very large. The probability that the result will fall within the bounds of GR predictions is around 1% (2.5σ). The probability that the NM result is valid is less than e<sup>-100</sup>&mdash;zero. And you should take into account that ±0.11 is only a lower limit of precision. The real experimental limit was of course larger. For instance if the precision is 0.22”, it will mean that the difference is just 1.25σ&mdash;insignificant. 
:::: 3) It is the first time I read that the Newtonian theory explained precession of orbits. First of all in the coulomb potential particles move along closed trajectories and therefore orbits can not precess. To explain precession the potential must deviate from 1/r law. In the second half of 19-th century several theories were proposed: a new planet (Vulcan) inside the orbit of Mercury, non-zero Solar quadrupole momentum, modification of the gravitational potential of the form 1/r<sup>1+&alpha;</sup>, where &alpha; is a small parameter. All of them were rejected by different reasons. Old books (especially printed in 1711), of course, can contain weird claims, but it only means that they are not reliable sources. Can you provided any citations from the second half of 19-th century that support your claim that NM actually explained precession of orbits? Probably not.

Do you think Dyson, Eddington & Davidson were simply deluded in thinking Newtonian theory made any prediction of a positive gravitational deflection ? They say in their paper that the 0.87" deflection predicted by the Newtonian law of gravitation was made by Einstein himself in a 1911 paper in the German 'Annals of Physics'. On their opening page they wrote on the hypothesis 2 they were testing:

:::::"The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun's limb amounting to 0".87 outwards."

::::'''Logicus to Ruslik:''' OK, thanks for clarifications. Just on your point 3 here, Will's 1986 'Was Einstein right ?' says precession of Mercury's perihelion was 574" per century, and in the 19th century Leverrier predicted 38" short of 574" = 536" on Newtonian mechanics. I think Newcomb corrected this by little sometime later ? The 1920 Dyson et al paper says motion of Mercury's perihelion exceeded Newtonian predicted value by 43" per century, and this was accounted for by Einstein's GTR. Thus the salient point here seems to be that some 94% or so of the precession of Mercury's perhelion was explained by Newton mechanics. As I said, the precession was very largely explained by Newtonian mechanics.
:::::: Well, I concede point 3. Of course, orbits precess under the influence from other planets. I meant only that the anomalous precession had remained unexplained until GTR. However the classical precession was not especially remarkable, while the anomalous part was. [[User:Ruslik0|Ruslik]] ([[User talk:Ruslik0|talk]]) 19:49, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

::::It is most refreshing and welcome to see a Wikipedia editor who apparently regards the 1713 second edition of Newton'''s Principia'' as unreliable, as indeed it was, and contrary to the positivist misrepresentation of it in Wikipedia articles as reliable and correct. 

::::My remark about the 1713 ''Principia'' arguably predicting a precession of Mercury's perihelion refer to its prediction of moving aphelia for Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury in its new Scholium to Proposition 14 of Bk 3 that was added to the second edition, and contradicting the 1687 first edition's Proposition 14 claim of static aphelia, also repeated in the second edition. The essential background to this novel prediction is that Roger Cotes had forcefully pointed out to Newton that Leibniz's critique of universal mutual gravitation as unproven in the first edition was correct, and that in particular the proof in Propositions 1 to 8 of Book 3 collapsed into question begging circularity at Corollary 1 of Proposition 5 where Newton invalidly attempted to move from demonstrating unilateral centripetal gravitation to proving mutual bilateral gravitation by appeal to his third law of motion. Given this failure of absolute proof of mutual gravitation from the 6 Phenomena of Book 3 and Leibniz's general point that logically deductive  proofs from facts to theorems were impossible in empirical science, Cotes' recommended revised proof strategy seems to have been to adopt the Huygens-Leibniz criterion of empirical proof of a theory by the successful prediction of entirely novel phenomena. And two of these novel phenomena that were supposed to prove mutual gravitation in the second edition of the ''Principia'' were the mutual perturbation of Jupiter and Saturn at conjunction and the moving aphelia and nodes of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, all perturbed by Jupiter and Saturn. See Cotes's 1713 Preface, and in particular see Corollary 3 of Proposition 5 and Proposition 13 of Book 3 for the predictions of the unilateral perturbation of Saturn by Jupiter.

::::But as it happened none of these phenomena could possibly be observed at the time, and morever most farcically in neither case did Newton's predictions imply mutuality, but rather only unilateral perturbations of one planet by another, but not vice versa. But he gave a hypothetical estimate of the motion of Mercury's aphelion as 256" per century conditional upon that of Mars being 33' 20" per century, apparently just to illustrate the proportionalities rather than any absolute values.

::::Now a moving and precessing perihelion surely follows immediately from a moving aphelion if Mercury were not to crash into the sun eventually. This is the possible argument that in effect the precession of Mercury's perihelion was first (implicitly) predicted in the 1713 ''Principia'' by virtue of its prediction of its moving aphelion as a result of Jovial gravitational perturbation. But this was of course only a qualitative prediction inasmuch as the amount of its perihelion precession was not derivable from that of its hypothetical but quantified aphelion advance.

::Regardless of any supposed incompatibility between Newtonian Mechanics and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, it is a <cite id=lintonrefret>[[WP:V|verifiable]] fact<sup>[[#lintonref|[1]]]</sup></cite> that in 1784 Cavendish obtained a formula for the amount by which light, according to his interpretation of Newton's theories of optics, mechanics and gravity, would be deflected by a massive body.  Expressed in modern notation, his formula was <math>2\,\arcsin(\epsilon/(1+\epsilon))</math>, with <math>\epsilon =^{def}\ G m/(c^2 d)</math>, <math>G =^{def}\ \mbox{gravitational constant}</math>, <math>m =^{def}\ \mbox{mass of the body}</math>, <math>c =^{def}\ \mbox{velocity of light at infinity}</math>, and <math>d =^{def}\ \mbox{distance of the light ray from the centre of the body}</math>.

Cavendish did not publish his result, but essentially the same formula ''was'' published in an astronomical journal by Johann von Soldner in 1801.

::Cavendish and Soldner's calculations assumed that light was corpuscular, as required by Newton's theory, and seem to have been pretty much ignored throughout the 19th century.

'''Logicus to Ruslik & Wilson''': Before reading Wilson's interesting intervention, I had proposed the following.
 
On Ruslik's Point 1: On point 1, it is clear that even Newton himself predicted gravitational lensing and also that Einstein, Dyson, Eddington and Davidson also regarded it as predicted by Newtonian theory and making a quantitative prediction for it. And it is their view that is relevant here, not your view that it is not so predicted.  Thus whether the GTR prediction of gravitaional lensing was successful or not, it clearly cannot be counted as a case of the prediction of a novel phenomenon only predicted by that theory, as required in the Huygens-Leibniz criterion of theory acceptance it seems Wikipedia is employimg here.
<cite id=ruslikcomment2>:So you think that Dyson et.al. is a reliable source that should be relied upon? Well, I will accept this conclusion, but other results of that paper are also valid. For instance, that GTR was confirmed and the Newtonian theory was rejected. You can not cherry pick just one thing from this paper, and neglect another.</cite> [[User:Ruslik0|Ruslik]] ([[User talk:Ruslik0|talk]]) 20:57, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

Point 2: This point is irrelevant because the issue is whether gravitational lensing was predicted by any other theory, not whether the experiment's quantitative outcome refuted any other theory. And if it did, then this means it was predicted by another theory, and so again gravitaional lensing does not belong in the list in question.

Also note that Dicke & Goldenberg 1960 challenged the validity of GTR Mercury perihelion precession result against Newton, and I understand it may still be unresolved.
 
In conclusion it seems there are no valid objections to the deletions of orbital precession and gravitaional lensing from the list of novel phenomena otherwise unpredicted. So I conclude that the GTR predictions of Mercury's orbital precession and of gravitational lensing  must both be deleted from the current list of novel phenomena only predicted by GTR, and discussed seperately as possibly examples of phenomena just predicted more accurately than by other theories by GTR rather than phenomena uniquely predicted by GTR.

I propose something of the following ilk for such a discussion:

'In its early days GTR also predicted some phenomena already predicted by Newtonian theory more accurately, such as the orbital precession of two planets, Mercury and Mars, and the gravitational lensing of light. But whether the outcomes of these pr'edictions refuted Newtonian gravitation and confirmed GTR is disputed.'

: What are trying to prove here? That GTR is uncofirmed theory and there are alternatives to it? This is wrong. GTR is one of the basic theories of modern physics. GTR is used to calculate trajectories of space probes. If it were wrong Cassini would have been unable to fly by Enceladus at the distance of 25 km. So validity of GTR is out any question. 

: Dicke et al claimed that quadrupole moment of the Sun is large enough to explain anomalous precession. This is wrong. Currently the value of quadrupole moment of the Sun is not known, because it is too small (on the order of 10<sup>&minus;7</sup>)&mdash;see ref that I provided above. So the work Dicke was erroneous.

::The problem with ''Wikipedia's'' claiming that General Relativity was confirmed by the results reported in the paper is ''not'' to do with any supposed unreliability of the source, but with the [[WP:NPOV|neutrality of that point of view]].

I say "unfortunately" here, because I happen to agree with you that the analysis of Earman and Glymour's reported by '''Logicus''' doesn't appear to stand up to scrutiny.  At the risk of polluting this talk page with some [[WP:OR|original research]] of my own I will point out that the significance of the differences between the General Relativistic predictions and the experimental results reported in the paper of Dyson et al. are even ''less'' than [[#rusliksig|what you have concluded above]].
::The error bounds given in the paper were ''not'' estimated standard deviations as you have surmised, but estimated ''probable errors''&mdash;i.e. estimated differences between the limits of a 50% confidence interval about the experimental result and the result itself.  If the errors were normally distributed, the probable error would only be 0.674 of a standard deviation.  This means that the actual estimate for the standard deviation of the experimental result from the 4-inch Sobral telescope, for instance, is 0.178" rather than 0.12".  Thus, a two-tailed significance test of the discrepancy between the prediction and the experimental estimate gives a p-value of 0.196.  I'm aware of no circumstances under which any texts on statistics or experimental method have recommend regarding such a high p-value as being "significant".  In my opinion, a p-value of 0.196 indicates at least a "fair" agreement between the prediction and the experimental result, and I wouldn't argue with anyone who wanted to describe it as "satisfactory".

:::I can't resist also pointing out that if one ignores the suspicions of Dyson et al. that the results from the Sobral astrographic telescope had been vitiated by systematic errors, then a reasonable statistical analysis of all three results shows that the agreement between those results and Einstein's prediction turns out to be excellent.  Contrary to the [[#alldata|claim of Earman and Glymour's]] quoted by '''Logicus''' above:
::::"If one kept the data from all three instruments, the best estimate of the deflection would have to be somewhere between the Newtonian value and the Einstein value."
:::the maximum likelihood estimate of the deflection, based on all three experimental results, is actually 1.817" with an estimated standard deviation of 0.152".  Two-tailed tests of significance of the discrepancies between this estimate and the Einsteinian and Newtonian predictions give p-values of 0.668 and 1.3 x 10<sup>-9</sup> respectively.  So if there were in fact ''no'' systematic errors in the data, the experimental results would actually be in ''excellent'' agreement with Einsteinian prediction and decisively refute the Newtonian.  The sum of squares of <s>the</s> <u>appropriately</u> normalised differences between the maximum likelihood estimate and the three experimentally determined estimates is <s>5.01</s> <u>5.66</u>.  If there are no systematic errors, this should be (at least approximately) distributed as a &chi;<sup>2</sup> with <s>three</s> <u>two</u> degrees of freedom, giving a p-value of <s>0.17</s> <u>0.06</u> for a right-tailed test of the significance of the discrepancy.

:::: I agree with your assessment. I also find the current content of the article satisfactory. I began this discussion only because Logicus wanted to get rid of the light deflection result (and precession result as well) as a confirmation of GTR. In his opinion measurements confirmed both Newtonian and Einstein predictions (or refuted both). I felt that he was trying to insert his personal interpretation ([[WP:OR]]) into the article. So I showed him that opinions could differ widely: I, for instance, hold a strong opinion that the classical mechanics made no predictions about light deflection, and therefore there was nothing to test in the first place.

But I fear it seems that, like Silly Rabbit and Wolfkeeper, you misunderstand the main  issue I am raising. I am not raising the issue of whether GTR is now generally regarded as empirically confirmed by the (relevant) scientific community or is the best theory of gravitation or not. As I tried to make clear at the outset and again in my above reply to Wolfkeeper of 13 December, the question I am raising is that of whether Wikipedia's original unreferenced claim, at least as claimed when I first raised the issue on 7 December 2008, that the success of GTR is due to its successful prediction of novel phenomena not predicted by any other theory, is true or not. This is a question of scientific method in the history of science, and in particular a question of whether the Huygens-Leibniz criterion for the acceptance of a theory as confirmed by empirical facts is observed by scientists or not, or whether they follow some other criterion. 

The subsequent revisions of this claim since I first raised it at least shows some appreciation of the methodological problem here, which is most welcome in Wikipedia. However, in spite of revisions, the problem still remains. For the current formulation of the claim now compounds the problem by raising the issue of whether success is due solely to the successful prediction of novel  phenomena not predicted by any other theory, as was originally claimed, or must also be accompanied by some more accurate prediction of already known phenomena or of phenomena also predicted by other theories, as it seems is currently claimed, as follows:

"General relativity has enjoyed much success because it predicted new phenomena that other theories of gravitation could not account for, and was found to be substantially in accord with otherwise anomalous measurements."

To render this claim more intelligible, I presume it means

'General relativity has been widely accepted because it predicted new phenomena that other theories of gravitation did not and also provided more accurate explanations of some phenomena than other theories did.'

So on this account it was the conjunction of better explanations of already known or otherwise predicted phenomena with the unique and successful prediction of entirely novel phenomena that caused the wide acceptance of GTR.

But is this true ? It is certainly false on the conflicting account according to which GTR was accepted just with its 1915 more accurate explanation of Mercury's perihelion precession, or with its 1919 degree of success in explaining gravitational lensing, and hence essentially widely accepted by 1920 at the latest. This view of the GTR 'revolution' is to be found in such as Zahar's 1973 ''Why did Einstein's programme supersede Lorentz's ?'' in '''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science''' and in his 1989 book ''Einstein's Revolution: A study in heuristic''

The important fact to be determined here is when did the relevant scientific community convert to GTR from the Newtonian law of gravity. And thus was this after both conjunct conditions of the logically conjunctive cause currently given were satisfied ? 

(I refrain from complicating matters further by pointing out that in addition to mercury’s perihelion precession and gravitational lensing, nor was gravitational red shift a novel phenomena unpredicted by any other theory.)

Certainly as the claim stands it needs a justifying reference. --[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 16:00, 21 December 2008 (UTC)
: Scientific community converted to GTR from Newtonian theory in 1905, when special theory of relativity was created. Soon after this event it became abundantly clear that the Newtonian theory of gravity needed to be replaced with a relativistic theory. While GTR, of course, did not exist in 1905, it is fair to say that physicists abandoned Newtonian theory in favor of a future theory of gravity in that year. It is because of this abandonment of Newtonian theory, that its "predictions" were of little importance after 1905. [[User:Ruslik0|Ruslik]] ([[User talk:Ruslik0|talk]]) 16:25, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

::The scientific community converted to SR from Newtonian theory ''after'' 1905; and in many cases well after. It took time for people to take the theory on board and for further experimental results en masse to persuade people. GR took even longer, I'm pretty sure it did not persuade a lot of physicists for many decades, although some would have taken it on board almost immediately, others never. At most the Edison results was the knee on the curve where after that only a highly convincing win for Newton and against Einstein would have turned the tide back the other way- and that has never happened. Could the Edison result be considered compatible with Newton- yes, of course if you modify Newton to add massive light, but that wasn't the theory held at the time, and I am certain that some physicists would have hung on with Newton.

:::: Just to clarify the nature of the justifying reference that is required here, it is one that demonstrates GTR was only successful after it had successfully predicted some novel phenomena of a kind not predicted by any other theory. As is clear from the foregoing extensive discussions, Mercury's perihelion precession and gravitational lensing were not such phenomena, and nor was gravitational red shift (1925?), albeit on the basis of these three alleged better explanation by GTR some may wish to argue GTR was widely accepted by the 1950s or even 1930s.

It neither makes any statement about when GTR was first generally accepted, nor mentions any confirmation of entirely novel phenomena not predicted by any other theories. Like to have another go ?

Meanwhile it might interest you to know that contrary to the Wikipedia claim that the success of GTR is due both to successfully predicting entirely novel phenomena and also explaining some known phenomena more accurately, at least in 1962 the distinguished American historian of science Tom Kuhn wrote: "Even today Einstein's general theory attracts men principally on aesthetic grounds, an appeal that few people outside of mathematics have been able to feel."

Perhaps it would behoove you to purchase a copy of the Pauli book so that you can debunk it to your own satisfaction (privately, I hope).  The quotes do establish that by 1921 GR had at least gained acceptance for explaining the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, and additionally that the 1919 eclipse was seen as a decisive confirmation of the theory.  At any rate, I would be interested in seeing ''you'' have a go at it (since you obviously fancy yourself an expert).  As a cosmological theory, outside of [[WP:TE|tendentious]] claims to the contrary, there is no reasonable contention that general relativity is today anything but the dominant theory.

== Did GTR predict an expanding universe ? ==

The article seems to claim GTR predicted the expansion of the universe and its alleged confirmation by Hubble was therefore a successful test of it, as follows:

“The expansion of the universe (predicted by Alexander Friedmann) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929”

This claim was flagged for a justifying clarification as dubious some time ago, but none has been forthcoming. 

Surely on standard accounts, with its cosmological constant GTR did not predict an expanding universe, notably Einstein’s self-proclaimed biggest blunder. More generally the (possibly mistaken) impression from the literature is that the posit of the expansion of the universe is logically independent of GTR, which does not make any such predictions in itself, but rather depends upon positing initial conditions extra to GTR. On this analysis then GTR did not itself predict an expanding universe. And I thought (possibly mistakenly) Friedman calculated various different scenarios depending upon initial conditions.

I therefore propose the deletion of this claim at least until the situation is clarified.
--[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 17:13, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

The chain is sketched for example, in ch. 15 (Cosmology: The Standard Model) of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity'' {{ISBN|0-471-92567-5}}  : [[Einstein field equation]] , with solution [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric|FLRW]] metric -> [[Friedmann equation]] -> one solution is [[expanding universe]]. --[[User:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis]] ([[User talk:Ancheta Wis|talk]]) 17:44, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
'''Logicus to Ancheta Wis:''' Thanks for these references, but your phrase “one solution is expanding universe” surely confirms GTR does not in itself predict an expanding universe, as I pointed out. I understand Friedman’s three different models of expansion depended upon independent postulates of both the speed of expansion and of the density of the universe, three different values of which gave the three different models when the cosmological constant is set to zero. Perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate the logical point here is to point out that if GTR entailed expansion then it must also contradict and be refuted by contraction, yet in Friedman’s first model expansion is then followed by contraction. The expanding/contracting/static state of the universe or not is rather a logical consequence of different models of initial conditions rather than of GTR. Hence it seems none of these states can be counted as predictions of GTR and thus of confirmations of it. I conclude the claim must therefore be deleted from any list of tests of GTR itself. --[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 15:56, 4 January 2009 (UTC)
: GTR predicted that universe can not be static. It must either contract or expand. Hubble discovered that it does expand. So this prediction of GTR was confirmed. [[User:Ruslik0|Ruslik]] ([[User talk:Ruslik0|talk]]) 19:39, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

::Of course Logicus is right that GTR doesn't predict an expanding universe as such. I see you've [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitation&diff=261913507&oldid=261906442 edited the article] to reflect this, but I'm still unhappy with the edited version. A nonstatic universe may be a prediction of GTR, but it isn't a ''new'' prediction. The problem with a static universe is very simple: a bunch of objects at relative rest are not going to remain at relative rest under the action of a force that's always attractive. Any gravitational theory is going to make this prediction, so the mere observation that the universe isn't static doesn't help you choose between them. Newton was aware of the problem in his theory and tried to solve it by supposing that the universe is infinite in size and filled uniformly with matter—the idea being that this matter would not accelerate in any particular direction because it would be pulled equally in all directions. This doesn't work, though, because the series (or indefinite integral) that gives the force acting on each object is not absolutely convergent and hence can be rearranged to sum to anything at all. You can restore predictivity by factoring out a gauge freedom, and the solutions you get then aren't static, they are expanding/contracting cosmologies that look very much like FLRW cosmologies and even obey the Friedmann equations—see [[Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Science/2008_March_21#Metric_expansion_of_space|here]]. Newton lacked the mathematical machinery to understand this, of course. If he had understood it he might well have tried to make the universe static again by introducing a repulsive force that's directly proportional to distance—which is the Newtonian equivalent of the cosmological constant—and it would have failed for the same reason as Einstein's universe, because it's unstable under perturbations. There's nothing in the gross features of general relativistic cosmology that isn't also in Newtonian gravity. Hubble's data strongly suggested an expanding universe but didn't help to select one theory of gravity over another. I don't think it can be counted as a confirmation of general relativity by any stretch of the imagination. -- [[User:BenRG|BenRG]] ([[User talk:BenRG|talk]]) 20:54, 5 January 2009 (UTC)
::: Thank you for the link. Your explanation was really an interesting reading for me! However I want to note that ''a hidden gauge freedom'' is an additional assumption that is normally not a part of Newtonian mechanics. ''With gravity we can extend this from uniform motion to arbitrary motion'' Yes, agree with this statement, but this is what the general relativity actually says. So your model is based on some elements borrowed from the general relativity, including cosmological constant, which appears naturally in the general relativity, but needs to be manually (and rather arbitrary) added to the gravitational acceleration in the case of Newtonian mechanics. This model was actually invented after the general relativity was created. So the the first prediction of the non-static universe was still made by the general relativity.

== So wot about the red-shift ? ==

Surely the list of the empirical tests of GTR should include gravitational red shift ? But exactly when it was decisively confirmed seems to be debateable. --[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 17:26, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

== An attractive force or not? ==

The article seems to me to not be able to decide whether gravitation is due to an attractive force or not. Surely the article should be consistent in either it's point of view or in the way that it applies the term (or it's assumption) contextually.

Please note that, to my mind at least, an "attraction" and an "attractive force" are the same thing in the context of gravitation, for what else can cause a genuine attraction than an attractive force? Some other means of making two objects move closer together (eg pushing them) could not accurately be described as an attraction. As such when I use either "attraction" or "attractive force" in this discussion I equally mean the other. 
(If anyone disagrees with this point of view please let me know, although it's not specifically the subject of this discussion point.)

- The article's opening sentence states that the ''Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass attract one another''. This in my opinion states that there is an attractive force. (Perhaps it could be better expressed as '''''appear to''' attract one other''?)<br />
- The General Relativity section opens with ''In general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force'', which appears to contradict the article's opening sentence.<br />
- The last paragraph of the Earth's gravity section states that ''According to Newton's 3rd Law, the Earth itself experiences an equal and opposite force to that acting on the falling object, meaning that the Earth also accelerates towards the object''. This clearly assumes an attractive force between the two objects (the Earth and the "falling" object).<br />
That last paragraph in the Earth's gravity section is especially problematic for me. It goes on (in parentheses) to say ''until the object hits the earth, then the Law of Conservation of Energy states that it will move back with the same acceleration with which it initially moved forward, canceling out the two forces of gravity''. It is impossible to be sure what that is trying to say (hence why I'm afraid I cannot suggest any improvements to how it says it) but whatever it is it seems to be incorrect. It also explicitly uses the words "forces of gravity" ('''two''' forces of gravity even), albeit without specifying whether these forces are attractive or not.
(As it happens I'm not totally sure the final sentence of that paragraph makes sense either.)

There may be other examples. I really think someone should try to tidy up the use (both explicit and implicit), or not, of this force in this article. At the very least it would be nice to sort out the examples I've given.

'''Logicus''': Amen to that ! An underlying problem here is that modern physics is equivocal about whether it believes in forces or not and thus whether or not it still continues the master scientific project of Aristotelian Physics of trying to explain all motion and change in terms of powers or forces (of matter). Thus on the one hand it is claimed dynamical forces such as the force of gravity have been banished in favour of purely kinematical spacetime curvature. But on the other hand we are told modern theoretical physics is primarily concerned with investigating and finding a unified theory of the four fundamental forces of electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and, lo and behold, the force of gravity! Clearly such pedagogically confusing equivocation over the status of forces systematically infects this article. --[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 19:25, 5 January 2009 (UTC)
:Let's go easy on this. Physics is a work in process, as Thomas Brody notes in ''The Philosophy Behind Physics''. Although your skeptical POV is valuable, it is not mainstream, so I would advise you not to have reverted Ruslik. One disturbing thing about your POV is that your vision of logic uses [[monotonic logic]], rather than using [[defeasible reasoning]] which is very much compatible  with the belief revisions which are everyday occurrences in the scientific enterprise. There are some facts which are currently fervently believed, but which upon scrutiny, require revisiting with an open mind. That means, "there is nothing quite so dangerous as the man who believes he is in sole possession of the truth." Thus the scientific enterprise is very much like a 3-ring circus, with well-known facts serving as the foundation for structures currently undergoing revision. That does not call for the wholesale rejection of Newtonian mechanics in favor of post-Newtonian structures. Neiher does it call for defensive bulwarks around Newton and Aristotle. Their work is their work, for good or ill. Neither does it call for blind acceptance of Einstein's work. After all, most of our engineers use Newton, while a few are forced to include Einstein's work in their mechanical systems (such as the Global Positioning System).
:There is a mechanism, the [[functional equation]], which is the type of mathematical structure upon which current theory rests, which is beyond the Newtonian POV. It changes shape, as it were, so that it is Newtonian, and Einsteinian, and Aristotelian, etc. It is inappropriate to force Procrustean constraints (read monotonic reasoning) on Ruslik's edit when in fact there is room in the circus tent for all the POVs just displayed here. And Wikipedia expects this, to use a figure of speech about editing and editors. 
:Having said all this, the [[positivism]] and triumphal POV which physical and natural scientists learn at the feet of their teachers could very well be toned down with appropriate edits. There is much for humanity to be proud of in our current science, but there is more science to come, and you are correct to tone down any edits which claim humanity has the last word on anything.

== Gravity and astronomy section ==

I assume this section is supposed to describe how theories of gravitation (or specifically the related equations) have been useful in calculating certain astronomical data. I don't believe it achieves this aim especially well because, in two separate ways, it's not neutral. <br />
Firstly it seems to attribute '''all''' of this to Newton. Leaving aside the fact that this is probably contentious (hello Kepler, Bullialdus, Einstein, ...) the point is that it's out of place - it should be the equations that are portrayed as calculating/predicting these things, not an individual. Credit for these theories and equations is given elsewhere. <br />
Secondly it presents this "information" not as the results of calculations, but as facts. For example we have calculated masses of planets and stars, but we haven't proven those masses to be correct. In fact there are points in the Anomalies and discrepancies section that indicate that some of these things may not be correct. And Dark Matter was a concept invented to bridge the gap between the theories and the actual results - so while ascribing the existence of the theory of dark matter to gravitation is probably technically correct, it seems rather ill-placed in this section when it's possible that the explanation for the discrepancy is that the theories of gravitation are wrong.
(Please note I am not suggesting that they are wrong, although they may be for all I know, merely pointing out the fallacy of using unverified explanations of their apparent failures as a feather in their caps!)

Anyway if someone (who can) would like to edit this section to make it more neutral please do so.

== On Ruslik's logic GTR predicts the Moon is made of green cheese ! ==

The article still claims GTR predicted the expansion of the universe in spite of its patent invalidity and deletion given failure to provide any justifying quotation showing such a ludicrous claim has actually been made by anybody. But it was restored by Ruslik, who has failed to find any justifying quotation for this claim in compliance with Wikipedia Verifiablity requirements, just as he failed to do so for the now deleted claim that the success of GTR is due to it successfully predicting entirely novel facts not predicted by any other theory and also proving more accurate explanations of old facts. Ruslik argues as follows:

"Alexander Friedmann in 1922 found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even in the presence of the cosmological constant). In 1927 Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions (in the presence of the cosmological constant) of the Einstein equations are unstable, and therefore the static universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with results of Friedmann and Lemaître. Thus general relativity predicted that the Universe had to be non-stationary, it had to either expand or contract. The expansion of the universe discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929 confirmed this prediction.[14]" 

However, for those who cannot immediately see the elementary invalidity of this argument that if a theory predicts the universe either expands or contracts it therefore predicts the universe expands, then perhaps the briefest way of demonstrating this absurdity is to point out that by the same invalid crazy logic GTR also predicts the moon is made of green cheese. For on the standard semantical two-valued logic employed in science, just as for all tautologies, the tautology 'The Moon is made of green cheese or the Moon is not made of green cheese' is a logical consequence of every statement whatever, including the statements of GTR. Thus on Ruslik's logic that we may conclude that GTR predicts the universe is expanding from its logical consequence/prediction that it is either expanding or contracting, then we must also conclude GTR predicts that the moon is made of green cheese i.e predicts the first disjunct of the tautology. Or to make a closer analogy, because, like every theory and statement, GTR entails the tautology that the universe is either expanding or not expanding, on Ruslik's logic GTR therefore predicts it is expanding. And of course so does every theory and statement on this logic. Even the statement 'Ruslik is crazy' predicts the universe is expanding. Thus by ''reductio'' the claim is unfounded. QED. 

I therefore flag the claim once again for a clarifying quotation that establishes anybody makes such a ludicrously invalid claim, be it Pauli or whoever. However it should be noted that the above quotation from Pauli suggests he may be as unreliable on the history of physics as physicists usually are. For of course it was Leverrier who thought it possible to explain Mercury's anomalous perihelion in terms of a perturbing planet Vulcan, contrary to Pauli's claim. --[[User:Logicus|Logicus]] ([[User talk:Logicus|talk]]) 15:47, 9 January 2009 (UTC)
: It is you who seems to have problems with logic. I wrote that GTR predicted a non-static universe. Discovery of the expansion confirmed this prediction (if universe expands it is obviously non-static). Very simple indeed. So GTR predicted evolution of the universe. Though it is possible to say that GTR predicted the expansion to a certain extent too. 
: Yes, ''Leverrier thought it is possible to explain Mercury's anomalous perihelion in terms of a perturbing planet Vulcan''. However in 1921, when Pauli wrote his book, it was well known that this planet does not exist. So Pauli did not mentioned it. However he mentioned other possible causes of the anomalous precession such as Solar oblateness or some unobserved masses in the Solar System.

"Alexander Friedmann in 1922 found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even in the presence of the cosmological constant). In 1927 Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist.

Misner, Thorne and Wheeler have an ample discussion of this; I don't have my copy with me right now, but that would provide an appropriate reference. As to whether it is a test of GR, it is a test in the weak, but nontrivial, sense that GR predicts the possibility of (regardless of cosmological constant) and the necessity of (if one sets the constant to zero) a dynamic universe. It doesn't distinguish GR from other dynamic models of the universe, but historically it was very significant, since there were no other dynamic models in existence at the time.

== Inexperienced in the field of physics - A comment on gravity? ==

I was studying string theory, and a chain of effects were set into motion leading all the way back to gravity, when a concept dawned on me - Gravity is traditionally thought of as a force that pulls objects together, thus people and objects are pulled towards Earth as Earth is pulled towards the sun. However, if such a pulling force were to exist then wouldn't it cause these objects to pull in towards eachother, causing planets to collide with the sun? I realize this question may sound simplistic to physicists but I am lost. Thanks! [[Special:Contributions/71.54.120.113|71.54.120.113]] ([[User talk:71.54.120.113|talk]]) 03:16, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

If the Universe is governed by the mass-dependent (Newton's law) gravitational force, the Universe shall be spherical in shape as mass-dependent gravitational force has no preference in direction.

'''Commonsensible conception of gravity'''

1. According to the standard model, which describes all the forces in nature except gravity, all elementary particles were born massless.  Interactions with the proposed Higgs field would slow down some of the particles and endow them with mass. Finding the Higgs — or proving it does not exist — has therefore become one of the most important quests in particle physics.

However, for a commonsensible primitive mind with a commonsensible universe represented by 
'''E=Total[m(1 + D)]''' , from
http://www.physforum.com/index.php?showtopic=22994&st=0&entry373127
this conceptual equation describes gravity. It does not explain gravity. It describes it. It applies to the whole universe and to every and all specific cases, regardless of size.

2. Thus gravity is simply another face of the total cosmic energy. Thus gravity is THE cosmic parent of phenomena such as black holes and life. It is the display of THE all-pervasive-embracive strained space texture, laid down by the expanding galactic clusters, also noticed in the expanding energy backlashes into various constructs of temporary constrained energy packages.


'''Commonsensible conception of the forces other than gravity'''

The forces other than gravity are, commonsensibly, forces involved in conjunction with evolution:
http://royalsociety.org/downloaddoc.asp?id=4770

The farthest we go in reductionism in Everything, including in Life, we shall still end up with wholism, until we arrive at energy. Energy is the base element of everything and of all in the universe. At the beginning was the energy singularity, at the end will be near zero mass and an infinite dispersion of the beginning energy, and in-between, the universe undergoes continuous evolution consisting of myriad energy-to-energy and energy-to-mass-to-energy transformations. 

The universe, and everything in it, are continuously evolving, and all the evolutions are intertwined.

== Unsatisfactory sentence ==

:''The terms gravitation and gravity are mostly interchangeable in everyday use, but a distinction may be made in scientific usage. "Gravitation" is a general term describing the phenomenon by which bodies with mass are attracted to one another, while "gravity" refers specifically to the net force exerted by the Earth on objects in its vicinity as well as by other factors, such as the Earth's rotation.''

The last sentence gives a flavour of what's meant, but when you read it closely it is not coherent. Can I suggest we change it to read something like this:

:''... while "gravity" refers specifically to the net force experienced by objects on or near the surface of the Earth. This net force is dominated by Earth's gravitational force, but also includes other components such as the centrifugual force resulting from the Earth's rotation and the buoyancy force provided by the Earth's atmosphere.''  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.134.115.227|86.134.115.227]] ([[User talk:86.134.115.227|talk]]) 03:44, 11 February 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Opening sentence ==

The opening sentence is "''Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass '''attract one another'''''" [emphasis mine]. This sentence is not true since in Einstein's physics of gravitation (confirmed by all observations up to date so most likely the true physics) '''''there is no attraction''''' (though it looks like one to uninformed humans). In Einstein's gravitation there is ''only'' something called ''curvature of spactime'' and it's easy to show (even at a high school level) that it explains ''exactly'' the ''gravitational force''. If there were also some additional ''attraction'' (''a fundamental force of nature'', as those uninformed humans call it) the gravitational force would be bigger than it is, and so Einstein's theory wouldn't work. So maybe it would be good to modify the opening sentence in a way that it wouldn't eliminate Einstein's physics at the onset. 

Just a suggestion since I tried for years to modify this line myself to agree with Einstein's physics but it proved only that wikipedia editors don't believe that Einstein's physics is true. Since I'm doing my PhD in Einstein's gravitation I don't have this luxury of not believing in Einstein's physics but if wikipedia chooses to fool high school students (by 9:1 consensus) since grownups don't take wikipedia seriosly anyway, the opening sentence may stay as it is providing an example that the majority is sometimes dead wrong.

They may also ask their science teachers, which may prompt the science teachers to learn how gravitaton really works and to stop promoting the legend of attraction. Note that even Newton opposed this legend, being strongly against "action at a distance". The science teachers (at least some) may learn why the gravitational force is strictly an inertial force coming from the inside of gravitating object, which is known since 1915, when gravitation stopped being just math and bcame physics.

The main issue I see here is that everybody can edit wikipedia and the great majority of people, including retired physicists, think that graviation works through "attraction". So all those people feel offended by removing word "attraction" from their texts and fight for it. So anyone who knows how gravitation works has to give up. That's why I never could explain to the high school kids of wikipedia how gravitation really works according to Einstein since it was always reverted by consensus of retired (and even still active but probably in a different branch of physics) physicists who didn't believe that Einstein's physics could be so simple as I described it and thought that I'm presenting my own theory.

The major issue is that gravitational force is not "attraction" ("spooky action at a distance" in Einstein's words) but a push from inside of gravitating object. This push is due to [[inertial force]] resulting in an interesting and rather simple way from the curvatures of space and from [[gravitational time dilation]]. Curvatures of space and gravitational time dilation are called collectively "curvatures of ''spacetime''" and they found to be ''the only'' causes of gravitation. So gravitation is caused only by the geometry of spacetime and not by any "attractive forces" seen in the lead all over the place. Since inertial forces can't be "attractive". The mechanism of generation of gravitational force deserves an explanation in further parts of the article but unfortunately it is found nowhere in it. Which is another problem with the article. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] ([[User talk:JimJast|talk]]) 18:00, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

:Thanks for making my point for me.  Although I don't wish the lead to descend into too specific a phenomenological model (you had proposed stating baldly that gravitation is '''not''' attractive), I definitely disagree that the lead should be written from a predominately Newtonian perspective.  If anything, the lead should summarize the main points of the article; and the chief among these seems to be how the very idea of gravitation has evolved through history.  So I don't really see the current lead as a step forward, just a lateral step which only exacerbates the concerns of the present thread under discussion.  [[User:Acannas|Acannas]] ([[User talk:Acannas|talk]]) 03:56, 24 February 2009 (UTC)

::Jim, first, you're confusing Einstein's "[[spooky action at a distance]]", which was a reference to quantum entanglement, with plain old [[action at a distance (physics)]]. Second, you're confusing action at a distance with attraction/repulsion. In Maxwell's electrodynamics unlike charges attract, but there's (said to be) no action at a distance because the interaction is mediated by the field. You could say that the particles don't really attract each other, they just respond to their local fields in such a way that they end up getting closer together—but, well, that's what it means to say that they attract each other. If we only used "attract" for direct action-at-a-distance forces then we couldn't use it at all since there don't seem to be any such forces. The other question is whether gravity is different enough from the other forces that it ought not to be called a force. I don't think it is. The Standard Model forces are all [[gauge theory|gauge forces]], meaning that they can be understood very much like gravity as arising from certain "deformations of the background", except that the deformations involve internal degrees of freedom instead of just the four spacetime dimensions. Most (theoretically conceivable) forces can't be written in that way, so presumably it means something that all of the real-world forces can be. Presumably it's going to turn out that all of the "forces" are aspects of the same thing and all motion is equally inertial. That would be your typical particle physicist's guess, anyway. We shouldn't assert in the article that gravity's brand of attraction is special, since we don't know that that's true and it seems pretty likely that it isn't. -- [[User:BenRG|BenRG]] ([[User talk:BenRG|talk]]) 20:52, 24 February 2009 (UTC)

:::Ben, I didn't. I meant Newton's objections to attractive force based on his disbelief in action at a distance (idea of field acting on his own, also false, was not invented then). I just added to it the famous "spooky" to underline the fact that Einstein was also against action at a distance. Of course Einstein was talking about QM but Newton was talking about gravitation and both were against "action at a distance" ''in physics''. In any case "attraction" doesn't exist neither in Einstein's gravitation, nor in QED, nor anywhere else ''in physics'' (it might be OK in math or cosmology which aren't exact sciences in the sense of describing the real world). We just shouldn't feed with false physics the high school kids who look to wikipedia for true information since there are simpler and true (as far as we know) ways of explaining gravitation. [[User:JimJast|Jim]] ([[User talk:JimJast|talk]]) 23:15, 24 February 2009 (UTC)
:::It looks like a hopeless situation since I have the same problem at my university. The professors want to teach the first year phsics students only the Newtonian math instead of physics of gravitation. Despite that first year students have no problems with understanding relativity since they are already taught ''special relativity''. Yet professors think that physics students are too stupid to understand also the ''general relativity'' (or maybe professors are scared that students might be wise enough to understand it and find out that the universe can't be expanding, as the professors tell them, since it would have to violate a few physical principles). The result is that ''"physicists don't understand gravitation"'' (as one of professors said). Having no training in general relativity they don't know that the Big Bang is only math that follows the ''assumption of expansion'', not physics, in which there is ''no visible expansion, just the false interpretation of the Hubble redshift''. And this rdshift has also a legitimate physical interpretation contained already in Einstein's theory. ''"Physical theories are often wiser than their creators"'' [Heinrich Rudolf Hertz].

:::When we are at it I might reveal my idea of teching physics (and gravitation) that old physics professors are so much against: The last year should be dedicated to teaching the physical principles that students should absorb for their lifetimes. Once they internalize the idea that certain things are already known, as e.g. that speed of light is always <math>c</math>, the various ''principles of conservation'', the imposibility of ''action at a distance'' (even if theists think otherwise) etc. then they can draw conclusions based on those principles and other things that they know. E.g. that if the time runs more slowly "down there" then necessarily the photons move more slowly "down there", and since the total energy of any particle is (about) its <math>mc^2</math> then necessarily on any particle must act a "force" directed "down", equal <math>-dE/dx</math>, traditionally called "gravitational force". Smarter of the students may want to calculate this force and be surprised by a result that this force is exactly equal <math>mg</math>. Their science teacher should be there to help them to get through the math to get the right result. Which is not only my result but comes straight from Einstein's theory through ''simple differentiation'' that many high school students know how to do.

::::We may save ourselves some time and consider that many accepted views of gravity can and must be mentioned but to do so effectively requires a certain ordering of the enyclopedic information in the article. Thus the history of gravitational theory can be related to its role in undestanding celestial phenomena. I have given a hint of this in my edits to the lead. One can divide the article according to the effects of gravity (e.g. formation of planets, stars, solarsystem, nebulas, galaxies, black holes, explosions, bending of light, etc.) and in each explaning the extent of validity of various theories of gravity, such as those of Newton and Einstein.''<u>'''[[User:Kmarinas86|Kmarinas86]]''' <sup>'''[[User_talk:Kmarinas86|(6''sin''8''karma'')]]'''</sup></u>'' 02:29, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::I agree, and I'd add that from the reader's point of view it is imporant to split the theories into physical ones, which postulate a physical mechanism of the phenomenon (like Einstein's), and mathematical (phenomenological) ones, that don't even try to guess the mechanism (like Newton's). This way the readers together with information get education that helps them to organize their knowledge. Calling all theories just "theories" would surely confuse the reader into thinking that all theories are created equal and Newton's theory is as good (or maybe better, being simpler) as Einstein's. The reader may not even notice that Einstein's theory is physical theory with ''so far unlimited'' predictive power while Newton's theory is only math (also according to Newton himself) with its predictive power limited to special cases (of "slow velocities" in the frame of observer and "weak fields"). So making a decent article on gravitation without repeating old errors might be quite a job, but then it might become one of the best articles in wikipedia.

The opening statement is simply not true.
Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass attract one another.
Try ... Gravitation is an observed effect of curved spacetime whereby masses move toward other masses.

::It occurs to me that objects with mass *do* attract one another.  That definition is true, if only because it describes the obvious.

::The statement is true on two levels. Firstly, according to James Gleick's biography of Newton, the word 'gravity' wasn't well defined until Newton defined it as meaning the propensity of objects with mass to undergo a mutual attraction. Thus, one could say, by definition gravity is as described in the opening sentence. Secondly Einstein's spacetime is a purely mathematical abstraction of reality. It provides a way of accurately describing the behaviour of systems under the influence of gravity. However, it isn't of itself a tangible reality. Spacetime as an idea is an abstract description of the thing, but has become so conflated with the thing so as to be thought of as the same thing - it isn't it's a description of the thing. Thus the observation that objects with mass undergo a mutual attraction stands as a definition of gravity and is a different thing to that which effectively mimics gravity mathematically.[[User:Fizzackerly|Fizzackerly]] ([[User talk:Fizzackerly|talk]]) 12:08, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

::There is something confusing about the statement that gravitation is a force by which masses attract each other. The phenomenon of gravitational lensing suggests that light is affected by gravity.

::Could I suggest as opening sentences the following - "Gravitation is the name given to the observation that objects of mass appear to move towards each other.  Several theories have been proposed to explain the observation.  These are ......"  This gives a neutral explanation of the term "gravitation", with a nicely flowing link to introduce the various theories. The current opening sentence is IMO biased towards certain theories of gravity, which is not what this article should be about.  Many people will object to the inference that gravitation "IS" one of the four fundamental interactions and the use of the word "attraction".  The observation is quite plainly that objects move towards each other, this does not automatically imply an attraction.  These implications belong in the sections that explain specific theories.

more evenly distributed around said nucleus and produce no or minimal net electromagnetic output,hence,the physical effects of
weightlessness.Matter that falls within or approaches the magnetic fields produced by large bodies,experience torque,causing
"precessional motion",simultaneously changing the direction of its axis of rotation,and progressive angular momentum towards the large body,and causing an overall net electromagnetic output from said approraching mass.As the approaching mass feels the effects of a denser magnetic field from the large body,said mass experiences progressive angular momentum,"precessional motion",causing a greater net electromagnetic output and increased acceleration towards the large body.

== Censoring All Dissent: Does Censorship = Science? ==

How come there is no criticism of Newton's theory of gravitation on the page?  Afraid of criticism and dissent?  Is Wikipedia afraid of [[Neutral Points of View]] or not?

"Einstein’s theory of gravity is the craziest explanation of the phenomenon imaginable." -- Wallace Thornhill, physicist, 2001

"Leibniz also disagreed with other aspects of Newtonianism, such as the use of gravity, which he held to be a revival of occultism, and Newton's use of space as an absolute. Leibnizian physics defined motion and therefore space as relational." -- William E. Burns, historian, 2001

"Leibniz held that the Newtonian universe was imperfect because it occasionally requires God to intervene to prevent it from running down." -- William E. Burns, historian, 2001

"Leibniz also attacked Newtonian physical ideas, including absolute space and time, [and] the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which he charged introduced an occult force...." -- William E. Burns, historian, 2001

"Like Huygens, Leibniz never accepted Newtonian gravitation." -- Ezio Vailati, philosopher, 1997

"Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians." -- John M. Keynes, economist, 1936

"An atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity." -- Bertrand Russell, physicist/philosopher, 1924

"...what is really wanted for a truly Natural Philosophy is a supplement to Newtonian mechanics, expressed in terms of the medium which he suspected and sought after but could not attain, and introducing the additional facts, chiefly electrical—especially the fact of variable inertia—discovered since his time…" -- Oliver J. Lodge, physicst, February 1921

"Magnetism is possessed by the whole mass of the earth and universe of heavenly bodies, and is an essence of known demonstration and laws. By adopting it we have the advantage over the gravity theory by the use of the polar relation to magnetism. A magnetic north pole presented to a magnetic south pole, or a south pole to a north pole, attracts, while a north pole to another north pole or a south pole to another repels. This gives to us a better reason than gravitation can for the elliptical orbit of the planets instead of the circular. It also gives us some light on the mystery of the tides, the philosophy of which the profoundest study has not solved. Certain facts are apparent; but for the explanation of the true theory such men as Laplace and Newton, and others more recent, have labored in vain." -- C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915

"Since Newton announced his universal law of gravitation, scientists have accepted and educators taught it, and rarely has it been questioned. Occasionally one has the temerity to say that gravitation is a myth, an invented word to cover scientific ignorance." -- C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915

"What we call mass would seem to be nothing but an appearance, and all inertia to be of electromagnetic origin." -- Henri Poincaré, physicist, 1908

"...the great truth, accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed, is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball...." -- Nikola Tesla, physicist, 1904

"If we were to assert that we knew more of moving objects than this their last-mentioned, experimentally-given comportment with respect to the celestial bodies, we should render ourselves culpable of a falsity." -- Ernst Mach, physicist, 1893

"...certain theoretical investigations ... appear to me to throw doubt on the utility of very minute gravitational observations." -- George H. Darwin, physicist, 1882

"The long and constant persuasion that all the forces of nature are mutually dependent, having one common origin, or rather being different manifestations of one fundamental power, has often made me think on the possibility of establishing, by experiment, a connection between gravity and electricity …no terms could exaggerate the value of the relation they would establish." -- Michael Faraday, physicist, 1865

"Thus, thinking as Newton did (i.e., that all celestial bodies are attracted to the sun and move through empty space), it is extremely improbable that the six planets would move as they do." -- Pierre L. Maupertuis, polymath, 1746

"...to establish it [gravitation] as original or primitive in certain parts of matter is to resort either to miracle or an imaginary occult quality." -- Gottfreid W. Leibniz, polymath, July 1710

"Meanwhile remote operation has just been revived in England by the admirable Mr. Newton, who maintains that it is the nature of bodies to be attracted and gravitate one towards another, in proportion to the mass of each one, and the rays of attraction it receives. Accordingly the famous Mr. Locke, in his answer to Bishop Stillingfleet, declares that having seen Mr. Newton's book he retracts what he himself said, following the opinion of the moderns, in his Essay concerning Human Understanding, to wit, that a body cannot operate immediately upon another except by touching it upon its surface and driving it by its motion. He acknowledges that God can put properties into matter which cause it to operate from a distance. Thus the theologians of the Augsburg Confession claim that God may ordain not only that a body operate immediately on divers bodies remote from one another, but that it even exist in their neighbourhood and be received by them in a way with which distances of place and dimensions of space have nothing to do. Although this effect transcends the forces of Nature, they do not think it possible to show that it surpasses the power of the Author of Nature. For him it is easy to annul the laws that he has given or to dispense with them as seems good to him, in the same way as he was able to make iron float upon water and to stay the operation of fire upon the human body." -- Gottfriend W. Leibniz, polymath, 1695

"The present does not seem to be the proper time to investigate the cause of the acceleration of natural motion [i.e., gravity], concering which various opinions have been expressed by various phiolosophers, some explaining it by attraction to the center, others to repulsion between the very small parts of the body, while still others attribute it to a certain stress in the surrounding medium which closes in behind the falling body and drives it from one of its positions to another." -- Galileo Galilei, physicist, 1638

"The example of the magnet I have hit upon is a very pretty one, and entirely suited to the subject; indeed, it is little short of being the very truth." -- Johannes Kepler, astronomer/mathematician, 1609

"It is therefore plausible, since the Earth moves the moon through its species and magnetic body, while the sun moves the planets similarly through an emitted species, that the sun is likewise a magnetic body." -- Johannes Kepler, astronomer/mathematician, 1609

"But come: let us follow more closely the tracks of this similarity of the planetary reciprocation [libration] to the motion of a magnet, and that by a most beautiful geometric demonstration, so that it might appear that a magnet has such a motion as that which we perceive in the planet." -- Johannes Kepler, astronomer/mathematician, 1609

:Let's say you drop a bowling ball on the pavement. The potential energy of the bowling ball is converted into kinetic energy. When the ball hits the ground, that energy is converted into electrical potential energy between the atoms of the bowling ball and that of the ground. That energy manifests as the vibration we know as sound. Some of that energy travels through the ground, and some of that energy travels back into the air. Compression stores the electrical potential energy, and rarefaction is the action of releasing it.

== Lead section ==

Is it just me, or has the lead section deteriorated recently? (In case it changes under my feet, I'm looking at the version [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitation&oldid=277354652 here].) The opening sentence, "Gravitation is a natural phenomenon that gives weight to objects.[1]", strikes me as weak (and, incidentally, the reference given does not seem to even mention the word "weight"). The second sentence is something of a non-sequitur, and the rest of the first paragraph seems, well, kind of rambling.

If we're not happy to say "Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which objects with mass attract one another", which is how it used to read, then I think we should bite the bullet in the opening paragraph and explain the "force/attraction" and "spacetime" perspectives in as simple and brief a way as is humanly possible. Then, having mentioned these theories about what gravity actually "is", the second paragraph can start explaining the sorts of things that gravity leads to -- weight, tides, planets, convection, stars, etc. -- in some sort of logical order.

::*The last sentence, "''... while "gravity" refers specifically to the net force exerted by the Earth on objects in its vicinity as well as by other factors, such as the Earth's rotation''" is IMO grammatically faulty. I think the version [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitation&oldid=277354652 here] is grammatically better, but it's vague about why the net force on objects "in the Earth's vicinity" should be affected by the Earth's rotation.

== I know what it is, but not why is it. ==

The beginning of the article explains very clearly what gravity is. But not really what's going on. All particles in the universe attract each other with a force that falls off at the square of the distance, okay, that's simple enough. But why do they attract each other and how? [[User:-OOPSIE-|-OOPSIE-]] ([[User talk:-OOPSIE-|talk]]) 19:48, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

:(I am not an expert.) In Newtonian gravitational theory (the inverse square law that you mention), which is demonstrably not exactly correct, the force just "is" -- the theory does not offer an explanation of how or why. In GR, the curvature of spacetime makes it ''seem'' like there's a "force of gravity", as the lead section says. Depending on what you're expecting from the answer, that explains a "how", though very likely not a full and final "how". It seems unlikely to me that we'll ever know "why" if by that you mean "for what purpose". It doesn't seem to be a question for physics, anyway.

== "Centre" vs "center" ==

A recent edit changed the American spelling of the word "center" to the English "centre" in a quotation of a passage from a memorandum of Isaac Newton's.  Since this is a ''direct quotation'', however, the ''actual spelling'' used by Newton himself should be preserved.  According to [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=qomP58txKQwC&pg=PA1 the introduction] to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's <s>translation of</s> <u>commentary on</u> the ''Principia'', Newton did in fact spell it "center" rather than "centre".

:# Aristotle incorrectly believed gravity is a constant force.
:# Galileo determined gravity is a constant acceleration.
:# Newton refers to the "force of gravity", not gravity as a force

Yes, the introduction is a little sloppy and not accurate. Contrary to what the article suggests, gravity is not considered a "net force" and not necessarily Earth-centric. The term is used for other planets too. Secondly, gravity normally doesn't include other factors such as rotation...I believe that's EFFECTIVE gravity (see article: Earth's Gravity).

I'm an active astrophysicist and professor.  In all my years of research, I have never heard anyone assert that gravity refers only to the gravitational field of the Earth, not to those of other bodies.  I can't be absolutely sure that no dictionary anywhere defines gravity so narrowly (no dictionary I can find in a cursory inspection makes this distinction), but I am certain that the vast majority of astrophysicists use gravity to mean the attractive interaction between any two particles with mass.

== nonsense in Gravitational torsion, weak equivalence principle and gravitational gradient ==

This section is full of nonsense. In the title, "Gravitational torsion" refers to a specific hypothetical effect that would extend Einstein's theory of general relativity to include more general types of spacetime curvature; see http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/genrel/ch05/ch05.html#Section5.8 . The text of the section, however, never talks about gravitational torsion; it talks about torsion balances instead. The two usages are totally unrelated. The material about "Eötvös' law of capillarity" appears to be a joke, or vandalism. Unfortunately I can't edit this article to fix these mistakes, because it's locked. Wow. Wikipedia at its worst. This article should have the tag saying that it's in need of attention from an expert. --[[Special:Contributions/75.83.69.196|75.83.69.196]] ([[User talk:75.83.69.196|talk]]) 20:36, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

== Is gravity a fictitious force? ==

General relativity says that objects move in straight lines in curved spacetime.  Doesn't this mean that gravity is a [[fictitious force]], just like [[centrifugal force]], [[Coriolis force]], and [[Euler force]]?

Like these other fictitious forces, gravity is proportional to mass.  So does gravity really act on mass at all?  Or is it proportional to mass because it is only an acceleration as perceived from our convenient but erroneous frame of reference?

And if gravity ''is'' a fictitious force, how can anyone consider "unifying" it with electromagnetism and so on?  You wouldn't "unify" EM with centrifugal force, would you?  And why would you expect there to be a [[graviton]] to mediate gravity, if there's not one to mediate Coriolis force? [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 19:40, 4 January 2010 (UTC)

== Gravitational vector field addition. ==

<gallery>
Image:force_distribution_vectors_due_mass.png|At the center of gravity, the gravitational vector fields add to zero. Equal and opposing forces in all directions. Darker is a vector field that sums towards the center.</gallery> That does not imply that the force of gravity at the center of gravity is zero, it implies that the vector field forces, due the masses, are such that they are equivalent in all directions and pull a particle, that is in the center, equivalently in all directions. When a particle enters the gravitational field, the vector sum of the forces due all masses, as that particle passes through that mass, changes direction. For the earth, the force of gravity at the surface is 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>, which is a vector sum of all the attractive forces due the masses. At the center, inside a uniform sphere, the forces due gravity on that particle are not equal to 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>, but less (less than half that amount but if somebody would do the exact calculations that would be appreciated), and is a vector field pointing outwards from the center, equivalent in all directions. Any deviation from that central tendency would create a vector field with a higher force in the direction of the center of mass, and less so in every other direction.<br />
If someone could add this explanation it would be appreciated. I am not well versed in the meriat ways to change a project wiki page and definitely not a profesional editor.<br />

::I doubt that the [[center of mass]] must be the point where an object's ''internal'' gravity zeroes out. For example, suppose someone helpfully attaches a 1 solar mass white dwarf to a solar mass worth of space elevator cable to tug it around with. If you're standing on the surface of the white dwarf at the base of that space elevator cable, you'd better have brought your slimming fashions. Yet the center of mass should be halfway between the center of mass of the white dwarf and the center of mass of the cable, i.e. 1/4 of the way up the cable. You'd actually be getting pulled strongly ''away'' from the center of mass. Now the [[center of gravity]] is a little trickier to define but it still is a term referencing external gravity - e.g. the handled white dwarf would orbit a galactic black hole with its center of mass tracing the ellipse, provided nothing ruptures.

:::Forces due the masses. Center of gravity is the forces due each individual particle or mass, center of mass doesn´t come into play. The sum of the forces at the center of gravity goes to zero. There is a slice of spherical pie that pulls that particle towards it. However, all the other slices of spherical pie also pull with the same force. The vector sum of all the forces on that particular particle are effectively zero. That implies that it has a tendency to stay stationary in that particular position. Any particle with mass has a ´gravitic´ attraction to any other particle with mass, it´s a basic property of matter. A massless particle, not having mass, is not matter. A massless particle is a reference to a form of interaction that has nothing to due with matter, ie:no gravitic attraction, in order to balance an equation.<br />
:::The implications are that at the center of gravity you only need to exert a very slight force to move that particle but you would need an incremental gradient of force to remove that particular from the sphere of influence of gravity. The cummulative effect of all the vector force fields of all the particles that compose matter. The picture is not completely clear but would need another one to describe the force of gravity outside the mass.

== Space between nucleus and electron ==

What is in the space between the nucleus and the electron cloud?  The Ether or spacetime.  Most objects are like homogeneous sponges of this ether (like sponges in water), ie there is space between the nuclei and electrons of our atoms, but in black holes this space does not exist because it was forced out by the gravity, so there are nuclei that are in direct contact with their electrons.  the ether that was forced out sits on the event horizon waiting to get back in.  this is like putting a balloon (black hole) in a tank of water (ether).  This also explains gravity on our planet, it is very similar to our atmosphere.  This also explains why most calculations give the volume of black holes as infinitely small: because we are using the ether to measure it and all the ether that would normally be inside the black hole (if it was a giant planet) is sitting on the event horizon, therefore the event horizon '''is''' the surface of the black hole's mass, and when objects are pulled in they spread out over the entire surface like a balloon creating another layer of matter below the ether conglomeration. And in order to get hte correct volume of the universe we need to include this volume it is not a single infinitely small point, that is like saying the balloon in the water is an infinitely small point because it has no water in it![[Special:Contributions/63.76.208.2|63.76.208.2]] ([[User talk:63.76.208.2|talk]]) 18:00, 29 January 2010 (UTC)Kevin Burns[[Special:Contributions/63.76.208.2|63.76.208.2]] ([[User talk:63.76.208.2|talk]]) 17:59, 29 January 2010 (UTC)<span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/63.76.208.2|63.76.208.2]] ([[User talk:63.76.208.2|talk]]) 17:53, 29 January 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:The space between the nucleus, consisting of protons and neutrons, and the electron cloud is filled with force lines of whatever you wish to discuss. The four universal forces that they attempt to place together. If you take into consideration beta emission (see alpha, beta, gamma radiation) and consider near-field and far-field radiation, ie far-field being beta decay where an electron is expelled and near-field where an electron is expelled and re-absorbed due proton-nuetron exchange and interaction, then you also have other force fields and particles within that space. In black holes, the radiation that enters a black hole is not emitted in the same spectrum as it entered. If you look at the diagram above (a previous post), you will notice that at the center of a black hole, the gravitic lines are away from the center. This is due the distribution of masses around the center. Particles are extremely compacted but masses none-the-less. At least, that is the common understanding. Now, for the punch-line, somewhere around the event-horizon is a point where the individual parts of an atom are seperated. Each mass particle will have a different velocity vector associated to it due to it´s kinetic energy, ie mass-velocity relationship, and therefore, particles, as we know them, do not exist inside this sphere. There are no atoms, just electrons and whatever the makeup of protons and nuetrons are but in different layers. The heavier particles somewhere in the center, the lighter ones further out.
Using your terminolgy, the event horizon could feasibly the surface of the black hole´s mass and for practical purposes could be considered to be at least the upper atmosphere.

The statement in the opening paragraph:

"The simpler Newton's law of universal gravitation provides an accurate approximation for most calculations of behaviour near the Earth's surface" or similar

and again at the end of the "Newton's theory of gravitation" section I would recommend appending "near the Earth's surface" to the last sentence.

If a specific reference to the Earth is undesirable then perhaps "in very weak gravitational fields" or something. Newton's law is imprecise enough that Einstein's General Relativity is needed for GPS satellite calculations for example.

== 100 years from now ==

100 years from now people will look back on our ideas about gravity and laugh
uproariously. Each new generation, including ours, thinks they know "everything", 
or at least can explain the important issues. It seems to me we probably know
very little. I think we're like ants at the edge of a vast ocean. The majority of
us are still superstitious and ignorant. Even the smartest of us are incapable of 
really understanding the scale and duration of the universe. Fundamentally, we 
don't know what we don't know. It seems obvious there must be basic things about
the universe that we currently know nothing about.

Physicists blather on with their mathematics and arcane jargon about things beyond
their understanding. The basic idea presented is that when I let go of a ball, it 
falls because space-time is curved. But what starts the ball moving downward, if 
there is no force? Einstein's great discoveries came from thought experiments 
that had intuitive and logical outcomes. This is neither intuitive nor logical.

At least the article doesn't include that silly picture of space-time curving inward 
like a depressed trampoline, and the ball spinning down toward the middle. That picture
is pitiful pseudo-science. We can't draw a picture of the curvature of space-time. And
once again, why would the ball go down the "gravity well" if no force?

Every decent scientist acknowledges limits and uncertainties to their work, and I think
the article should do the same. The article has an "anomalies and discrepancies" section, 
but this misses the bigger point that we really know nothing about the actual mechanism 
of gravity. The emperor has no clothes. I'm sure it pains the physicists to be so ignorant 
about such a basic phenomenon. At least Newton had the honesty to say he didn't know. [[Special:Contributions/174.31.156.73|174.31.156.73]] ([[User talk:174.31.156.73|talk]]) 07:09, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

On the plus side, the complexity of the language is baffling to the layman; Thus it is unlikely that anyone will go away with misinformation. However, that does raise the question of how suitable is this article for an encyclopaedia?

== Gravitation is a secondary effect (on masses) generated by Vacuum and Vacuum Energy as the primary source of "gravitational" forces applied on masses (a suggested mechanism) ==

{{cot|[[WP:NOTFORUM]] - [[User talk:2over0|2/0]] <small>([[Special:Contributions/2over0|cont.]])</small> 22:28, 17 September 2010 (UTC)}}
Gravity is, in my opinion, originally generated from the medium i.e. the Vacuum and Vacuum energy, on masses. the vacuum energy 10^107 joules per cubic centimeter creates a force (a repulsive in nature, since energy of vacuum is different from energy of mass and mass surface) on the mass surface, similar to surface tension force. 
The body of the mass provides a surface where vacuum energy fluctuations (waves?)could reflects off. these reflections of the vacuum energy would then become "synchronized" when reflected off the mass surface into high and low energy waves sinusoidal mathematical functions (orbits) mixed with other geometrical representing motion mathematical functions pending on Vacuum and Vacuum energy medium surrounding the mass. The density of the mass would be a deciding factor of the frequency of the vacuum energy synchronized reflection, in such a way that shorter wave reflected will form from a denser body (black hole). 
When two masses are within the fields of each others synchronized reflected vacuum energy waves(gravitational forces filed), they "shadow" each other from the non reflected vacuum and vacuum energy waves fluctuations; therefore falling into a lesser, a weaker repulsive medium, resulting in the observed attraction of the two masses to each other.--e:Y,?:G 06:37, 15 September 2010 (UTC)  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:E:Y,?:G|E:Y,?:G]] ([[User talk:E:Y,?:G|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/E:Y,?:G|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

The Black Hole event horizon support's the above suggested mechanism for Vacuum energy synchronized wave reflection off mass's bodies, in a way that the mass of the black hole is so dense that the vacuum energy waves reflected have wave length that does not support to carry the light waves or the electromagnetic waves as a lesser density mass bodies do.

Or the unreflectiveness of light off the Black Hole mass body, is may be because these vacuum energy synchronized wave reflection off the mass's bodies, must reflects off a body not of the dimensions of the Black Hole mass i.e. less than 5 solar masses. The form these vacuum energy waves reflected off the mass must meet a certain geometrical dimensions.

gravitational lensing is another example supporting the above suggested mechanism in a way that the reflected vacuum energy waves off dense bodies are not synchronized in the same way the lesser denser mass bodies do. 

Another conclulsion form the above suggested mechanism for vacuum energy synchronized wave reflection off mass's boies, is it must be in a certien formate for it to "carry" light and electromagnatic waves.



The reflection of the vacuum waves off a mass's body could work as "sonar" in way or light reflection in way to evaluate a mass density.--e:Y,?:G 08:44, 15 September 2010 (UTC)  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:E:Y,?:G|E:Y,?:G]] ([[User talk:E:Y,?:G|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/E:Y,?:G|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->--e:Y,?:G 21:55, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

== What really is Gravitation ? ==

When people says "Natural Phenomena", that means they dont get what really is the subject.
Lets try to find out what really is Gravitation if there is no "graviton" particles as Albert Einstein thought.....

If we take a look at the Universe as a whole we can see matter, energy, antimatter (we can see this only in human experiments) and "gravitation" (i intentionally omit some subatomic interactions as "strong interaction" etc)
Dont you see, that something missing in here ?

Well... some people asks " why there is no antimater in the universe.... 

In my humble opinion there is .... in form of gravitation.

Cause if we imagine that Universe is a spring like thing and if it was created from nothing, and is limited by its borders and gravity interaction is endless in space.... we will find out, that gravitation is nothing less and nothing more than ... ANTIENERGY.
Why ?< br>
&nbsp;If  the Universe contains matter, antimatter, energy, and gravity, and sum of those must be zero then the only solution is to treat gravity as antienergy.

If E. Einstein is right and E=mc2 then if we try to find similiar equation to antienergy it would be:
:AE=-m(-c)2

So if we find out that gravitation is antimatter .... so AE=G we can solve solution of the Universe.

:U= m + (am) + E + AE = m -m + mc2 + (-m(-c)2) = 0 + mc2 +(-mc2) = 0 

Isnt it showing that gravitation is nothing less than antienergy of the "spring" called Universe ?

Its so obvious that Gravitation is antienergy if we asks ourselfs what we need to put the Newton`s apple back on the tree ... we have to use energy .... to counteract with antienergy caled gravitation.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Cslpl|Cslpl]] ([[User talk:Cslpl|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cslpl|contribs]]) 11:35, 25 October 2010 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Some recent versions of this sentence have been poor English. IMO the current version ("Gravitation, or gravity, is a natural phenomenon by which physical bodies attract with a force proportional to their mass") is better, but still not ideal. "attract" seems to be crying out for an object like "one another". But then the second part would have to be changed to "proportional to the product of their masses" which may be more detail than we want in the opening sentence. Do we have to mention force at all at this point? Could we just say "Gravitation, or gravity, is a natural phenomenon by which obejcts with mass attract one another."?

== Couple more potential problems? ==

:"According to Newton's 3rd Law, the Earth itself experiences an equal [in force] and opposite [in direction] force to that acting on the falling object, meaning that the Earth also accelerates towards the object (until the object hits the earth, then the Law of Conservation of Energy states that it will move back with the same acceleration with which it initially moved forward, canceling out the two forces of gravity.)."

This seems to be saying that the Earth experiences a force that is equal in force. Should "in force" be "in magnitude"?

I have no idea what the part in brackets is trying to say. What happens after the collision (e.g. whether or not the two things bounce off each other) would seem to depend on their material properties. I don't understand the reference to the Law of Conservation of Energy or to "cancelling out" gravity.


:"When an object with commensurable mass would "fall" then the acceleration of Earth would really be observable."

English ("when ... then ... would") needs tidying, but I'm not convinced that "commensurable" is actually the correct word. I'm feel there's another, better word, but I can't right now put my finger on it!

== More poor English ==

The first sentence under the Anomalies and discrepancies section was a bit confusing when I first read it: "There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways." I assume it's meant to indicate they may 1) point to a need to revamp the theory or 2) perhaps have other explanations, but that's not immediately apparent. I think a little rewording would help tighten expression of the idea and get it across more clearly (the long phrase between "perhaps" and "may" almost breaks their connection).  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/173.225.203.115|173.225.203.115]] ([[User talk:173.225.203.115|talk]]) 01:30, 24 March 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Comment ==

I, in my mind invented this theory about if everything was opposite it would all be the same theory about 2-3 years ago and I wasnt sure because if the compilation of two changes wouldnt be effective because there wouldnt be a reason to have two changes in reason you would have one. Could you please explain this to me and also I have another theory. If we ever had the technology in mining equipment and the development of technology to reduce the intense heat and a long enough drill to drill through the entire earth.(Obviously not)but if we were to hypothetically drill through the earth and we jumped in this hole and the velocity and momentum faded away(although there is always momentum and velocity)and it ran out because energy does not last forever, would the gravity, since it pulls toward the centre, make us float in the centre of the earth? I.E. if you lived in north america and someone is in a part of asia (opposite side of the world)they would be relitively standing upside down compared to you but there is gravity so it is focused to the centre. My idea is that the centre of celestial body that has gravity related to the same amount of density to that of earth,would eventually form a bond between you and the forces of the body and make you evidentily weightless?

If you drop an object here on earth, it gets draged around with the planets spin(we know this because when we drop something it falls exactly where we expect it to even though the planet is spinning), at what distance does this happen? is this drag relevant to the moon? Enertia is in a line, but the planet is spining. Im honistly starting to believe in two gravities?

If you believe it's [[Coriolis_effect]] then what keeps hot air baloons going around with the planet? "Gravity also drags?"!

: An object dropped from a hight of 1m takes less than half a second to reach the ground (ignoring air resistance and buoyancy).  You are right about inertia making the object keep going in a straight line while the earth turns away from it, but in the time it takes for the object to land, the difference will be tiny.  This doesn't have anything to do with the moon; instead, it (and any other object in orbit around the earth) is essentially falling down, but moving forward fast enough that it always misses the earth - see [[Orbit]] for more details.

Under Specifics / Earths Gravity the following sentence is as follows,

"Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.81 m/s (32.2 ft/s) after one second, 19.6 m/s (64.4 ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.81 m/s (32.2 ft/s) to each resulting velocity."

I think the 19.6 m/s should be changed to 19.62 m/s

It's minor but the the gravity constant of 9.81 m/s is precise to two decimal places and I think the 19.6 m/s value given should also be precise to two decimal places.

== a loop hole in newtons theory of gravity.. ==

if i fire a cannon ball right up in the air (neglecting air resistance) it is but obvious that it fall down. sir newton gave inverse square law, according to which gravitational force is inversely proportional to square of distance between the two objects. now as i fire the cannon ball in the air, the distance is going to increase, and so the square, so as per the formula gravitation force should decrease, but it does not happen. ball falls returns to earth. if the force is decreasing as per increase in height according to the formula, then what is making the ball to return back to earth.
the answer to this is very simple, its gravity but this force is not exerted by the earth(''it according to me'') but it is the layer of atmosphere around the earth. --[[User:Jokerthedarknight|Jokerthedarknight]] ([[User talk:Jokerthedarknight|talk]]) 13:59, 9 January 2012 (UTC)
:The force due to gravity would lessen as the cannon ball went higher, however, it would not completely disappear.

::First, this page is for discussing the article, not the topic itself. Questions about the topic can be asked at the Science Reference Desk. However, the statement above is incorrect. Anything that is in orbit, like the shuttle or the International Space Station, has not 'escaped' the gravity of Earth. The gravitational force is still quite significant there, which is why the object stays in orbit. It is because of its speed that it doesn't return to the ground.

== History ==

Gravity was first discovered by a Hindu astronomer who thought of the idea of gravity but did not give it a specific name or meaning.  Varahamihira observed the effect of gravity on heavenly bodies as well as things that are coming back to the Earth.

on gravity was Brahmagupta. He was a Hindu astrologer who commented that gravity, as a concept, is a natural affinity or part of the natural order of the world. He even compared it to elements like water and fire.

The 11th century saw the coming of another Hindu astrologer named Bhaskarachaya. He continued the efforts of Brahmagupta. He also wrote a book that mentioned gravity. This book is entitled “Siddhanta Siromani.”

Another worthy contribution of the Hindus on gravity was by giving it a definite term. The term was in Sanskrit and was called “Gurutvakarshan.”

Years, decades, and centuries passed before the Christian world became interested in gravity as much as the Hindus. The Western Christian world became interested in the sciences after the Renaissance, a period of revival of classical knowledge. Although gravity is not particularly mentioned in classical Greek or Roman texts, some scientists began to rediscover ancient beliefs about the world that led to the rediscovery of gravity.

Christian gravity features many people who are famous and familiar with modern people. These people are better known compared to their Hindu counterparts due to the dominant Western history and traditions in the world.


 
One of the leading figures is Nicholas Copernicus who proved that the Earth is round rather than a flat surface. This contradicts the thought that a vessel traveling the oceans would fall off the “world’s edge” as once believed. All things on Earth are held down by gravity, even in a spherical shaped body like a planet.

Galileo Galilee followed Copernicus in the 17th century. Galileo was known for his famous experiment of dropping two materials with different weights at the top of a tower. He also contradicted a classical teaching by Aristotle, a leading Greek philosopher.

Meanwhile, the most famous scientist focusing on gravity is Sir Isaac Newton. Newton’s discovery was founded from Robert Hooke’s suggestion that gravity is related to distance and its inverse square. Sir Newton also developed the mathematical formula and established the law of gravity.

Another leading and famous figure is Albert Einstein who founded the Theory of Relativity. Like Newton’s, Einstein’s contributions are considered to be the classic or the dominant teaching when it comes to relativity.

Western Europe’s contribution on gravity ideologies are those taught in schools today. In addition, these Western figures are able to express gravity in a formula (specifically a mathematical one) to make gravity more realistic as opposed to an abstract concept. Gravity is a constant element in our reality, but it is still very abstract since we can only feel or experience it even in everyday life.

Both Christian and Hindu gravity concepts have played an enormous contribution to the understanding of gravity.

== Smallest particle where Gravity is measurable ==

I am just a layperson who is fascinated with the creation of the Universe (the final frontier).  I read various theories, such as from nothing came something, but where my lack of knowledge puzzles me, is this;  how do these dust particles in space the size of a pinhead (once they collide) start to stick together to eventually form planets?  Do these dust particles have gravitational pull?  What is the smallest size that has ever been measured to have gravitational pull...........an atom?  Again, I am no scientist, but if atoms have gravitational pull, why wouldn't larger objects on my desk be drawing smaller objects to them to 'adhere' to each other?

== The cause of gravitation is unknown ==

I think we should mention in the lead that we do not know the cause of gravitation. We can observe gravitation and we can calculate it, but we do not what is the true cause of gravitation. We have noticed that it is assosiated with large bodies such as the Earth or the Sun, but we do not know why these objects create gravitation around themselves. Can the [[theory of relativity]] answer this? The cause of gravity is the curvature of [[spacetime]]? Unproven. --[[User:Hartz|Hartz]] ([[User talk:Hartz|talk]]) 15:31, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
:Yes, the existence of a Wikipedia user named Hartz is also unproven. (These posts could have arisen through random glitches in the Wikimedia software.) We also do not know why charged objects create an electric field. Or why energy is conserved? Or why the laws of nature are time translation invariant? (the last two are equivalent though) Or why the standard model has SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry. Science is not in the business of explaining why thing work the way they do, but of explaining how they work the way they do.
:What we do know is that general relativity, by describing gravitation as curvature of spacetime rather as a Newtonian force, gives a better description of observed physics than Newtonian gravity. Your GPS proves this everyday (if you have one).[[User:TimothyRias|T]][[User talk:TimothyRias|R]] 09:27, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

Hartz is right. "Action at a distance," otherwise known as gravity, remains one of the four or five unsolved conundrums of the cosmos. (Six if you count "the existence of a Wikipedia user named Hartz.") The article in no way reflects the perplexities still surrounding the phenomenon.

Science only uses two forms of linear measurement for velocity:- one is almost obsolete - feet per second, whilst the majority of scientists use the System International Unit of the metre per second. Therefore if someone wishes to express something in inches they are not only using a non-recognised measurement, but also a rather complicated one too. Even NASA uses metres per second in all its calculations - only reverting to feet, miles when it presents information to the general public.[[User:The Geologist|The Geologist]] ([[User talk:The Geologist|talk]]) 12:25, 23 July 2013 (UTC)

== Question ==

Something bothered me in the article when it came to "...Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate." etc. When looking at the formulas for calculating gravity it seems to me that the resulting force is equal to the total mass of BOTH objects. This would mean that a 10kg hammer will fall faster than a 1kg hammer, the reason being the total mass of the 10kg hammer + the earth is greater than the 1kg hammer + the earth. It is probably not easy to measure but logic and the formulas suggest to me that this must be actually be true. So why is it suggested that all things fall at the same rate when that would appear to contradict the newton formulas? Shouldn't somebody make a note on this point? 

The same would apply if you use Einsteins theory, the object would have its very own (though very small) effect on space time which must add to the same effect of the earth itself. Strangely in every picture of space time warping I've ever seen only the larger body was assumed to warp space-time and cause a gravity well. Strange.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.154.226.26|62.154.226.26]] ([[User talk:62.154.226.26|talk]]) 11:51, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Then the comment "Galileo '''correctly''' postulated air resistance as the reason that lighter objects may fall slower in an atmosphere." is actually wrong, that is what I'm getting at.

Let's say there is a hammer that is 1kg and a car that weighs 1000kg on the international space station. And let's say when we drop the hammer, the gravitational force between the hammer and earth is X. Then when we drop the car, the gravitational force would be 1000 times X, or 1000X. But how is it that they both accelerate downward at the same rate?

Yes, the acceleration is the same because the 1000X force is used to accelerate 1000kg car whereas the 1X force is used to accelerate 1kg hammer. I hope that makes sense.[[User:Tofoo|Tofoo]] ([[User talk:Tofoo|talk]]) 07:56, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

Acceleration in a vacuum is constant due to there being no air resistance. Galileo's hypothesis was proved during the Apollo missions to the Moon. See the video on the main page. In respect to dropping two objects of different mass on the ISS, they are in weightless conditions - which is actually a continuous free fall on a parabolic plane which means that they accelerate uniformly regardless of mass. However get in the way of a hammer and it will hurt when it collides with you, because its mass is still present.[[User:The Geologist|The Geologist]] ([[User talk:The Geologist|talk]]) 12:32, 23 July 2013 (UTC)

== Acceleration due to gravity ==

Acceleration due to gravity is not as shown in the article but is correctly expressed in the formula V = Gravity per second SQUARED. I have written it deliberately in that format as many people forget the "'''per second squared'''," bit. As written it is a linear acceleration and would not create the "gravity parabola," when plotted on a graph.

Hence at time zero the velocity is equal to 9.8 x 0 squared, after 1 second the object falls 9.8 metres, after 2 seconds it falls a further 39.2 metres making the total fall after 2 seconds 49 metres, after 3 seconds the object will have fallen a further 88.2 metres making the total fall 137.2 metres. This assumes nil resistance due to the viscosity of air, which would reduce the fall and hence the total fall.

Just to prove it further here is a table for 0 to 10 seconds:

 G m s2=	9.8	
		
T secs	fall m	total fall metres
0	0.0	      0.0
1	9.8	      9.8
2	39.2	     49.0
3	88.2	    137.2
4	156.8	    294.0
5	245.0	    539.0
6	352.8	    891.8
7	480.2	   1372.0
8	627.2	   1999.2
9	793.8	   2793.0
10	980.0	   3773.0

If you don't believe it then I suggest you go and talk to a physicist, or a parachutist as one lesson that everyone who goes parachuting learns is that once you leave the aircraft you will accelerate to 32 feet per second per second which is 9.8 metres per second squared. Which also limits the amount of time available for free fall.

I use the above formula and table to calculate volcanic bomb fall and distance given the mass of the bomb it becomes simple to calculate the exit velocity from a vent. Which is why as someone claimed "volcanic blocks the size of houses," could not be thrown from an erupting Cumbre Vieja on La Palma to Tenerife some 80 kilometres away.

Gravity is a force that acts on a distance so if you change the mass distribution at point A the force changes at point B but unless point A is point B the force doesn't change instanly. I understand that if Sun would disapper now, it would take roughly 8 minutes before it would be felt on Earth. That is to say the "speed" of gravity would be c. I might be mistaken but it certainly can't be larger than c because that would violate Einstein causality.

Not true. Even in general relativity, gravity, with no gravitons or any quantum stuff, moves at the speed of light. In fact Einstein's motivation for developing general relativity came from realising that, unlike electromagnetism, Newtonian gravity wasn't consistent with special relativity because in Newtonian gravity information travels infinitely fast (ie the strength of a gravitational field in Newtonian gravity is dependent only on the present mass distribution, not any information about where mass may have been in the past).  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.27.55.215|92.27.55.215]] ([[User talk:92.27.55.215|talk]]) 20:57, 18 May 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->


There cannot be such a thing as speed of gravity, if taking general relativity in consideration. It is only information regarding spacetime curvature that is "traveling." For instance, if the sun were to suddenly disappear, the change that occurs to the spacetime manifold between where the sun used to be and where the earth would be updated at the speed of light - which is about eight minutes. But "gravity" isn't really moving at the speed of light. This is a topic which is discussed in [gravitational wave].

==What is Chromotivity==

Chromotivity is a non Einsteinean Chromodynamic Relativistic theory of spin.
Each chromodynamic oscillation perceives a different spin value to each near by chromodynamic oscillation, but as a whole-particle they have an averaged spin. The Big Bang degenerate particle, the black hole degenerate particles and all indivisible particles, are shaped by enveloped chromodynamic oscillations, and are enveloped to form one particle because of the "lightspeed equilibrium law"-read below.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.84.214.171|2.84.214.171]] ([[User talk:2.84.214.171|talk]]) 05:26, 14 February 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--signed by Chromodynamic-->

==Weak Spin Relativistic Degradation==

Spin doesn't change directivity if the particle is not crushed on another particle or strong field.
Particles though distort the default properties of the void. That tiny perturbation is a field force, therefore causes a small spin degradation over time, towards the area having the lowest energetic potential. That tiny relativistic spin degradation is also known as gravity.
Gravity is not caused by reciprocal particle to particle direct exchanging of energy, but via their averaged perturbation to a non default void, because of the particle perturbation. A non default void sucks space and particles to restore it's default levels. The ultimate default levels of the void is the lowest possible quantum noise at almost 0 Kelvin temperature degrees [0 K do not exist in nature, not even before the Big Bang time frame but space can get close to 0K through time and entropy]. That "ultimate" default of the void is accomplished via entropy and requires zillon years. After all black holes would be evaporated in the afar future and all particles would be photons [only photons can exist at these ultra low energy levels of that afar future] spread under the lowest possible quantum noise threshold [therefore mixed with quantum noise and becoming virtual or low energy chromodynamic oscillations],the lightspeed equilibrium [a law that doesn't allow particles gain more kinetorotational energy because the sum of their "spin speed" and "external speed" cannot get higher than the lightspeed kinetic energy] would almost collapse towards an infinite "spin-degrading-speed" but dead-frozen "external speed". That ultimate breakdown mathematically can never occur, therefore many Big Bang hot-spots are perforced to explode.

Matter and particles lower the probability of virtual particle appearance, therefore matter has a lower energetic potential than the void.[[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.84.214.171|2.84.214.171]] ([[User talk:2.84.214.171|talk]]) 03:06, 13 February 2015 (UTC)<!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--signed by Chromodynamic-->

==Gravity doesn't pull us together, Emptiness compresses us==
If we have two spheres, one big and one small that have the same angular momentum, the small sphere has to spin faster
in order to maintain the same angular momentum with the big sphere.

Gravity is a relativistic field force of the void that compresses particles in order they shrink, because the void becomes affected by matter and
urges to set back to default. That shrinking forces particles spin faster in empty space, therefore you grow older faster, more quantum events
occur to you relativistically in comparison with a same room that stands on a planet and not in empty space. Particles cannot shrink in no degenerate pressure is applied, therefore that extra energy is expressed as external relativistic motion, also known as angular distance shrinking.

Empty space has a preferable default [multi Big Bangs themselves, therefore urges to reset all values to that default].
Matter distorts that urge of the void to reset, and when we add more matter to an existing gravitational system, the gravitational field
causes the void to exert pressure, to shrink these invasive particles. Particles cannot shrink without huge degenerate pressure, therefore
they release that energy as external kinetic energy, that shrinks the angular distance to the area with the lowest energetic potential.

The more matter we have, the closer we are to a low energy potential, because matter and antimatter have lower potential energy than the void,
and that's why the absolute void can never exist, only Big Bang is exploded when temperature is very close to 0 Kelvin degrees temperature, and when the quantum noise level is at it's lowest possible. That occurs because of the "lightspeed equilibrium law", a law that forces all particles maintain permenantly the light-speed energy level, and express it in two forms: a.external speed, b.angular momentum[spin speed], at the lowest possible temperature, the void tends to tear apart the lightspeed equilibrium with infinite spin speed, and zero external speed [to an extreme absolute zero void, one gets infinitely old immediately, therefore there is infinite planck potential to express inside that time the entire Universial energy range], but a quantum frame before that occurs, we have a new Big Bang.

Gravity seems to be weak as a force, because most of it cancels out, because it is exerted spherically, omnidirectionally.
Gravity forces particles to shrink from all directions, but particles aren't allowed to shrink.
All vectors of gravitational forces exerted on a particle cancel out, except a tiny force that pushes the particle towards the lowest energetic potential, thus the centre of gravity.

Gravity doesn't pull us together.
Emptiness compresses us. A gravitational field simply reveals paths towards the lowest energetic potential area.

Dark Matter is Dark Energy surrounding matter, but when matter moves fast enough, Dark Matter may lack behind, because it has an affect
on the properties of the void, and these affects do not move with external speed close to the light-speed, because on the lightspeed equilibrium theory, Dark Matter spends more of it's lightspeed equilibrium energetic ratio, in the form of rotational [spin] energy.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.84.214.171|2.84.214.171]] ([[User talk:2.84.214.171|talk]]) 07:35, 12 February 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--signed by Chromodynamic-->

== What is it? ==

All these theories about the effects of gravity but not one theory mention about what gravity actually is and/or the mechanism of how it works. It would appear there may be no theories and the article should state that. If theories exist they should be mentioned in the article. Most of this article apears to be fluff on abstract and unrelated downstream topics based on only the effects of gravity.

Nobody knows! The best guess we have is that gravity works by atoms exchanging "virtual particles": why this creates a force anyway is very hard to understand. The only reason we think this might be the case is because it's worked for all the other forces we know, but if you do the same maths with gravity, for technical reasons it doesn't work. There are thousands of physicists working to resolve this problem.
However, Einstein's equivalence principle suggests that gravity isn't really a force, it is purely an effect of the geometry of spacetime. There are plenty of physicists who believe that there are no virtual particles because (a) the Einstein principle makes gravity different, (b) the maths doesn't work for gravity, and (c) despite dedicated experiments, nobody has seen the elusive gravity particle.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.27.55.215|92.27.55.215]] ([[User talk:92.27.55.215|talk]]) 21:08, 18 May 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

If we don't, it should say we don't.  --[[User:Westwind273|Westwind273]] ([[User talk:Westwind273|talk]]) 04:35, 29 May 2012 (UTC)

In fact the article is quite tendentious insofar as it plumps squarely down in the Einsteinian account of things, as though it was all quite settled: "The phenomenon of gravitation itself, however, is a byproduct of a more fundamental phenomenon described by general relativity, which suggests..."  Stating that something ''is'' while in the next breath basing that assertion on a "suggestion" is, to say the least, somewhat overreaching. Space time curvature and the finite but open universe that it is premised upon have been in question ever since telescope observations during Einstein's own lifetime strongly "suggested" that the universe was actually non-curved and still expanding and may well be expanding to infinity. All in all, such topics invite a more skeptical, provisional and, dare I say, scientific approach, or so it seems to me.

:The simplest answer is that Einstein's suggestion that gravity is the effect of mass on the geometry of spacetime. You stretch out a bed sheet and put a big ball in the middle. Then put a smaller ball somewhere else on the sheet. The smaller ball will roll towards the bigger ball.

- I first wrote the following Theory of Rendundant Terminology as a question for newton.dep.anl.gov <ref group=whatisit>http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/</ref> .  I'm sure I violated some rules of their format, so they have not as yet replied:

"'''I'''s (your weight) not the result of an equation that is based on the pressure (air, water what have you) around you, specially ABOVE you (just like underwater),  plus your mass MINUS the weight taken off the total of Pressure + Your Mass from CENTRIFUGAL force of the Earth trying to fling things off of itself?
I ask because no one has ever given me a satisfactory answer to what 'gravity' itself is.  I've never believed that mass attracts mass (the moon and earth are pretty massive, both with their own supposed 'gravity', yet we live).
My question is a call for a true definition of how 'gravity' can seem to inexplicably exist.  I believe it has more to do with the pressure of air all around and above us pushing us DOWN at a force all 'round about 1000 pounds per square foot of us.  My question calls for  an equation solved with factors that I'm unfamiliar with.

(Your/Something's/Anything's mass on Earth + Average Earth air pressure below the clouds) - (the weight that is offset by centrifugal force) = your weight?

Now if the weight offset by the Earth spinning at around 1000 mph  IS around the weight of the Air pressure around you, then 'gravity' is a made-up word that says it is an '''unknown force''' that somehow magically magnetizes you to the ground when you are more prone to actually being thrown off the Earth if it were not for the Compressed Air between the Atmosphere and the ground.

It doesn't matter how deep into the Earth you go, you won't become 'heavier' because of LAVA MAGNETISM.  Go deeper and you think the extra pressure will push you down harder therefore you're heavier? No, you will have MORE centrifugal spin effect the closer you are to Core, therefore equalizing with the air pressure around you and maintaining your weight.

When something is crushed under the weight of earth pressure that is not air (like WATER), we say it was crushed by the pressure all around and above it.  We do not say, 'It has more gravity, its own weight crushed it'.  Above water, we insist the rules (physics) change somehow right from the quark.

The universe may be labeled 'an empty vacuum', but that doesn't mean to say the whole mass of the Universe does not have PRESSURE.  The pressure exerted by the Universe on a Planet PLUS the spinning planets centrifugal release of water, heat, mineral and biological gases EQUALS Atmosphere, with the resulting 'sandwich' of pressurized air created automatically between atmosphere and solid ground.   From a universal point of view, this little pocket of air pressure acts as a LOCK for anything that is heavier than what the earth can throw off of itself.  Hence, water experiences Evaporation, to be made into Clouds most irrefutably, when the ceiling called Universal pressure is met that pushes it back DOWN (which is why water doesn't just fly off forever, even without 'gravity').

Sorry, I'm not sure this is a question then.  It's a request to check the equation to dispel the myth known as gravity.  No equation can ever be made that has 'Gravity' in it, it would be flawed in trying to prove its own existence.  And a reminder to self that we shouldn't be messing with the clouds above our heads lol, they push us down, it's PUSH, not a non-existent, inexplicable PULL.  I have no references for my theory."

An incorrect statement: "Even though electromagnetism is far stronger than gravity, electromagnetism is not relevant to astronomical objects, since such bodies have an equal number of protons and electrons that cancel out (i.e., a net electric charge of zero)." Plasma physics is used to describe plasma, not gravitational theories. 99% of the universe is plasma, so gravitational theories apply only to the 1% that is solids, liquids and gasses - i.e. matter composed of equal numbers of protons and electrons. Planetary orbits around a charged object. Plasma is only neutral when it is not in motion. Motion produces electric currents and magnetic fields which affect other particles. At least please get the science correct and make a correct statement. "When the charges move, they generate electrical currents with magnetic fields, and as a result, they are affected by each other’s fields." <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29</ref>
The only astronomical bodies electromagnetism is not relevant to are planets - made of those atoms that possess equal numbers of protons and electrons.

Many ions or electrons will.[[User:Steven J White|Steven J White]] ([[User talk:Steven J White|talk]]) 00:43, 17 February 2015 (UTC)

As for space being empty - of course it isn't. That is not supported by our own science. "Defining the field as "numbers in space" shouldn't detract from the idea that it has physical reality. "It occupies space. It contains energy. Its presence eliminates a true vacuum."[2] The field creates a "condition in space"[3] such that when we put a particle in it, the particle "feels" a force."<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28physics%29</ref> And if anyone insists it is empty, then they really need to stop using the permeability<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability</ref> and permittivity<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity</ref> of space in every single equation. It's empty or it isn't. It's filled with energy or it isn't. But if it isn't, then they need to stop treating it in the math like it is, but tell us it isn't.

== Incorrect drawing in relation to curved spacetime. ==

The gravitic well, is defined accorded to a point mass at it´s center. There is no point mass, there are gravitic effects within that mass and when you resolve the equations, the attraction becomes equivalent in all directions, away from the center, implying an outwards force, instead of an inwards force. Drawn, that implies that the tip in the center, is higher energeticly then outside the gravitic well. A [[sinc]] curve, without the side lobes, is the real curvature. --[[Special:Contributions/186.94.187.76|186.94.187.76]] ([[User talk:186.94.187.76|talk]]) 18:42, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

What does that mean?  "Agent" looks like a weasel word to avoid using the incorrect term "force"

In non-scientific terms, it is most commonly recognized and experienced as the quality of space-time that gives weight to physical objects, and causes physical objects to fall toward the ground when dropped from a height.

"Gravitation, or gravity, is a natural phenomenon by which all physical bodies attract each other. Many people still mistakenly think that mass attracts mass. While Newtonian physics describes gravity in this way, Einsteinian physics, since 1905, tells us that gravity is actually caused by a physical body traveling through space-time.

== Issues with forces definitions. ==
I have two issues with the third paragraph which describes gravity and the other forces, but I wanted to check here to see what others think first.

0) It is not really fair or accurate to call gravity "the weakest force".  There is no invariant way to compare the four forces: they behave very differently on different scales, and they depend on the respective charge values of particles which are affected by them.  It would be more accurate to say something like: "because particle rest masses are very small, gravitational effects between individual particles in the same inertial frame of reference are immeasurably tiny".

1) I don't believe it is true that the strong force has limited range.  In fact, the strong force is the only force that does not diminish as distance increases (not to be confused with the residual strong or nuclear force, which decays exponentially with distance).  Past a certain point, characteristics of particles make it significantly more favorable for the strong interaction to form particle-antiparticle pairs than to increase in distance further; but this isn't the same kind of range limitation as (say) the weak interaction.

I realize all this might be overly pedantic of me, but I think in general the third paragraph could be cleaned up a little.  I'll likely attempt this myself if I don't hear feedback soon.[[User:TricksterWolf|TricksterWolf]] ([[User talk:TricksterWolf|talk]]) 21:12, 11 August 2014 (UTC)

:In a way, it is being pedantic. We all know that among all the nonzero forces that can be exerted between a given pair of fundamental particles (while isolated together in vacuum at a particular moment), gravity will be the weakest. And we also know that on the larger scales, gravity is the only one that doesn't get cancelled out in practice by other things. These two observations are widely made (and given prominence) in the literature, so they should be mentioned in our treatment of fundamental forces. But by all means go ahead and finesse the wording. (That said, wouldn't you agree the strong force has limited range in the sense that, if you tried to pull a pair of <s>gluons</s>''quarks'' apart, beyond a certain distance your work will just end up sucking additional particle-pairs into reality, which conspires to let the force slip away?)

==Move to [[Gravity]]==
I don't have time to go into the whole spiel and actually appreciate ''Britannica''-style formalism, but I'll just take a second to note:
* Wikipedia's policy is <u>not</u> ''Britannica''-style formalism, but to use {{sc|[[wp:english]] [[wp:commonname]]}}s.
* The common name is [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gravity%2C+gravitation&year_start=1500&year_end=2020&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgravity%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cgravitation%3B%2Cc0 gravity]. Has been for the entire history of the concept, by orders of magnitude. Remains so.
* The [[Talk:Gravitation/Archive_5#Gravitation_is_not_gravity|initial rationale]] for moving most of the page's content to [[Gravitation]] was the muddle-headed idea that gravity and gravitation are separate concepts, "gravity" being a Newtonian archaism and "gravitation" being its proper Einsteinic replacement or "gravity" being a force and "gravitation" a tendency in matter.
* In fact, that is almost precisely backwards. Properly speaking, "gravity" is a quality of matter (its ''grave-ness'': its tendency to sink rather than rise, as opposed to objects possessing 'levity' or 'buoyancy') and "gravitation" (an act of ''gravitating'' or tendency to ''gravitate'': to grant gravity) is the force or property responsible for creating such a quality. Newton used both terms in their appropriate places, which is why he talks of objects' grav''ity'' but a theory of gravi''tation'' (Admittedly in Latin, but y'know).
* Improperly speaking, they are complete synonyms and already understood as such on this page. Einstein more often wrote 'gravitation' but he was writing in German and using the word correctly to talk about the tendency/force rather than the attribute of particular objects. In English, it's perfectly acceptable that they refer to the same natural phenomenon: 'gravitation' is definition 5 for "gravity, ''n.''" at the ''OED''. Our current article leads with the two terms as synonyms and (despite the namespace and its rationale) uses 'gravity' 108 times to 'gravitation'&rsquo;s 33.
* Of those two synonyms, 'gravity' is the more common by a wide, wide gulf. All the more so in the professional literature, where Google Scholar returns [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=gravity&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp= 2,600,000+ hits for 'gravity'] and [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=gravitation&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp= under 450k for 'gravitation'].

== Ancient History section not so ancient ==

This section states that the events it discusses are from the fourth century CE. However, according to the wiki for the famous Hindu astronomer it quotes from, Bhaskara II, that person was alive during the twelfth century. There is also confusion caused by quoting Bhaskara II as the author of the Surya Siddhanta. The wiki on the Surya Siddhanat does not mention Bhaskara II as one of what appears to be many authors/editors. The confusion may be that Bhaskara II authored a similar work called the Siddhānta Śiromaṇī. Wiki does not confirm that these two writings are one and the same. 

Thus, it appears that the entire section on Ancient History is unreliable. The events it discusses did not happen when it says and the quote is either not from the author or not from the piece of work to which the section attributes them to.

Dear moderators,

Following the Wikipedia page and historical references, Bhaskara 2 lived during the 12th century (till 1185), thus making the statement that Newton rediscovered gravity 1200 years later incorrect. Philosophia Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in 1687.

I would suggest to correct the sentence in the introduction about Bhaskara to something like "more than 500 years later".

== Dubious claim ==

<blockquote>''Around fourth century CE, the famous Hindu astronomer and mathematician, Bhāskara II in his work Surya Siddhanta wrote: "Objects fall on the earth due to a force of attraction by the earth. Therefore, the earth, planets, constellations, moon and sun are held in orbit due to this attraction." Newton rediscovered this 1200 years later (with the exception of the constellations, which are now known to be well outside the gravitational sphere of influence produced by the earth or sun).''</blockquote>

This information seems to be very tendentious and misleading. 

* First, it cites no references.
* Second, Newton ''rediscovered'' this? Even in Newton's epoch when it was known that the Earth was round, no one came to the conclusion the celestial bodies were in orbit due to a gravitational force. Imagine in the fourth century.
* Third, Bhāskara didn't "discover" that the same way Newton did. He thought that everything was moving around the Earth, which is false. Newton discovered the law of gravitation and used calculus to predict and explain the orbit of the every celestial body close to us.

:I'd say remove it.  There's certainly at least one blunder in it as it stands at the moment.  [[Bhaskaracharya]], or Bhaskara II, lived from 1114 to 1185, so if he was responsible for adding something like the quoted text to the ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'', then it would certainly not be "1200 years later" that Newton rediscovered it.  I had very strong misgivings about this when {{diff2|634713629|Gravitation|it was added}} last November, and started to look into it then.  However, I was distracted by other matters and never got back to it.   According to [[Surya Siddhanta|Wikipedia's article]] on the ''Surya Siddhanta'', it dates to much earlier than the 12th century when Bhaskaracharya lived, although the ''surviving version'', [https://archive.org/details/SuryaSiddhantaTranslation as translated into English] by Ebeneezer Burgess, does date to around that time.

:If you do a Google search on "Bhaskaracharya gravity" you will find various contradictory versions of this factoid plastered all over the web, none of them that I could find with a citation to a reliable source, or to the particular place in the ''Surya Siddhanta'' where the quotation supposedly occurs.  No source is cited for the assertion in Wikipedia's article on the ''Surya Siddhanta'' that Bhaskaracharya "modified" it, despite one's having been requested since February 2012.  I also haven't been able to verify this, although I have to admit I haven't as yet expended much effort trying to do so.  A few web sites attribute the quotation to Bhaskaracharya's ''[[Siddhanta  Shiromani]]'', rather than the ''Surya Siddhanta'', but, again, none that I could find cites a reliable source, or identifies exactly where in the ''Siddhanta Shiromani'' the quotation supposedly occurs.<br>
:'''P.S.''' Even if something like the quotation does occur somewhere in ancient Indian sources, the version quoted is certainly a mistranslation.

== Edit request on what gravity interacts with ==

The article states the gravity interacts with all particles having '''mass'''. According to  [http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/mass-energy-matter-etc/more-on-mass/the-two-definitions-of-mass-and-why-i-use-only-one/ Professor Matt Strassler], particle physicists do not make that statement. Rather, they say that gravity interacts with all particles having '''energy'''. Relativistic mass apparently is not a concept in modern physics.

Relevant paragraph from source:

<blockquote>Throughout this website, what I mean by `mass’ is a property of an object is sometimes called its “invariant mass” or “rest mass”. For me and my particle physics colleagues, it is just plain-old “mass”. The terms “invariant mass” or “rest mass”, used to clarify what you mean by the word “mass”, are necessary only if you insist on having a second, different quantity that you might call “mass”, which is more generally called “relativistic mass”. Particle physicists avoid any possible confusion by never using the concept of “relativistic mass” at all, much less giving it a name.</blockquote>

Photons are massless and yet subject to gravity because of the energy they possess. "Relativistic mass" is misleading and the above source shows several reasons why.

'''This problem hasn't been dealt with yet.'''  I agree with the sentiment of the original post, but I do not think the issue has been resolved, either in the ensuing discussion, nor on changes that have been made on the page. To me, the very first sentence of the article, as it currently stands, has a glaring inconsistency:

{{Quote|text=Gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought towards (or 'gravitate' towards) one another including stars, planets, galaxies and even light and sub-atomic particles.}}

But light does not have mass!  And yet the direction of light is changed because of gravity, as with [[Gravitational_lens|Gravitational lensing]].  The difference between the Newtonian and Special Relativity takes on gravity are explained well enough in what follows, but this initial sentence hangs on to the 'mass' idea from Newtonian physics in a way that is not justified and extends it in a way that is not correct (the current sentence strongly implies that light has mass).  Okay, I don't mean to sound jerky.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  You guys are great.  Thanks for giving your time and energy to care for the quality of wikipedia articles.  All I'm saying is that someone needs to 1) address the question

https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=light+doesn't+have+mass+but+is+affected+by+gravity

2) digest the answers, like this

{{Quote|text=The source of gravity in general relativity is an object called the stress-energy tensor, which includes energy density, momentum density, energy flux, momentum flux (which includes shear stress and pressure) etc. Obviously, light has energy, so it acts gravitationally in GR. Since E=mc2, we see that mass contributes an enormous amount of energy - so, massive objects have very strong gravitational fields, so that the other terms are negligible, which is why Newton's law works so well. However, they are there - so, light does have a gravitational field, even though it has zero mass. 
|author=Mark M |source=http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/34352/how-is-light-affected-by-gravity }}

and 3) change this article, especially that opening line.  Luchelibre came close when he suggested to say "gravity interacts with all particles having mass and/or momentum".  But I don't think that line gets the cigar.  

Okay, that's all I've got time for.  The future of [[Gravity]] is yours. [[User:Pigkeeper|Pigkeeper]] ([[User talk:Pigkeeper|talk]]) 12:51, 20 December 2015 (UTC)

== Semi protected now for FOUR YEARS!!!    (What the?) ==

There's no excuse for keeping an article protected for so long.  This article reeks of the kind of accumulated errors that would otherwise be fixed up by IPs.  Afraid of vandalism?  Tough it out.  Every other article has to deal with it.  When vandalism is done, UNDO IT and move on!  Don't go crying for permanent protection you babies.  Only a ''very few'' special-case articles are actually subject to actual long term "persistent vandalism".  This isn't one of them by a long shot.  It's time to remove the protection and grow some.

I've got a few good valid corrections to make, but I'm ''not'' going to make an "edit request" here on the talk page like a pantywaist.  Nor will I be bullied into making to an account and autoverifying just to satisfy you little brats resting on your semi-protection.  It's obvious, given the state of the article, that I'm not the only one to refrain.

There is ''no validity'' to an argument that a little vandalism ''four freaking years ago'' is reason to believe a problem ''still'' persists.  If there really is persistent vandalism.  Prove it.  Verify it.  Compare it to other articles.  ''Show us'' before implementing a stinking INDEFINITE semiprotection and then resting on it for FOUR YEARS!

Remove the semiprotection and you will surely get ''some'' vandalism, maybe even more than average, but you can deal with it like every other article does.  It'll be nothing you mamby-pambys can't handle.

You can also find textbooks that explain the distinction (e.g. the introduction, p20 [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TXxdVY6WE1gC&pg=PA19]). Basically, "gravitation" is used to describe the attraction among masses in universal terms, whereas the meaning of "gravity" is usually either the Newtonian force (which is not necessarily present in non-Newtonian theories of gravitation) or to the local inertial force in some frame of reference (especially on the surface of earth, e.g. in geodesy). In this case the gravity is unequal to the Newtonian gravitational force, because the former incorporates the centrifugal acceleration [http://www.sage.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/clynch_pdfs/intgrav.pdf]. Finally, "gravitation" is fairly unambiguous, whereas even within the sciences "gravity" has further meanings (including fluid density).

== Gravity does not include centrifugal (pseudo)force. ==

Inertial resistance to linear acceleration (and centrifugal pseudoforce) have some "equivalent" characteristics to the classical force between masses, but I'm pretty sure it's still debatable as to if and how they might be the same thing.

The Earth's Gravity section asserts, entirely without citations, that Earth "gravity" is the sum of the force produced by actual gravity and the centrifugal (pseudo)force.  Is this some kind of unexplained General Relativity based definition that actually ''equates'' (vs. "equavalence") C(P)f with the classical force between masses?  I don't think so.  But if it is, that's a very surprising idea to lay readers and it should be explained (in situ) with reliable references.  Instead, I think it's just somebody's odd ([[WP:OR]]) and ambiguous definition of terms.  As it stands now, the assertion is monstrously ''dubious'' and without a single reference.  I'll remove the assertion (that Gravity = force between masses + CF) soon unless someone can can make a good argument that I've got it wrong somehow (and can provide references).  For now, I'll just mark the need for citations.

Among other flaws, the section is careless in it's disambiguation between surface acceleration, gravity at a spot on the surface, and gravity at a spot in space that isn't rotating with the Earth.

[[Special:Contributions/100.0.124.147|100.0.124.147]] ([[User talk:100.0.124.147|talk]]) 21:31, 28 February 2015 (UTC)

:Steady on. There are multiple concepts of gravity.
:* One model is Newtonian gravity, and you are correct that Newtonian gravity is independent from the centrifugal force, but..
:* We all know that Newtonian gravity is an inaccurate approximation of reality, and that General Relativity is a much better model for gravitation. In GR, gravitation is no longer a force ''per se'', and all [[inertial force]]s are equivalent. This works out as saying that the gravitational acceleration that we experience on Earth is the vector sum of the Newtonian component and the centrifugal component.
:* Perhaps you don't care about theoretical models, and you are just empirically measuring the downward force on a unit mass (at some location on Earth's surface). The people who actually perform these measurements are called [[geodesist]]s. In this case the data you actually measure turns out to equal the total inertial force (again equivalent to combining the centrifugal component onto the Newtonian gravitational force). 
:Since you asked for references, I'll repeat the ones I gave recently: 
:* "''the way "gravity" is defined .. is the sum of the two effects''" (Note contrast with how Newtonian ''gravitation'' is defined.) [http://www.sage.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/clynch_pdfs/intgrav.pdf] (Taught at UTexas, US Navy, UNSW satellite navigation lab..)
:* "''the value of gravity [is affected by] the Earth's rotation''" (page 50) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TXxdVY6WE1gC&pg=PA19] (basic gravitational physics textbook)
:Does that help? [[User:Cesiumfrog|Cesiumfrog]] ([[User talk:Cesiumfrog|talk]]) 23:49, 28 February 2015 (UTC)

Very cool.  The "earth gravity" section desperately needs those citations.  It also needs to be more clear about when it's talking about what kind of gravity.<br>
I see one quote you give which says "''the value of gravity [is affected by] the Earth's rotation''".  Such passages occur ''in context'' in the source and are meaningless if the meaning of that context is not preserved.  Does the context really mean to say "the value of free acceleration in a surface frame-o-reference is affected by rotation"? (which is a very classical perspective).  Or, does it really mean to say something about the centrifugal pseudoforce in the surface frame ''being'' gravity in the GR sense?  Such a statement would be very much outside lay expectations and would require very good citations.  The fact that such a GR perspective is being used should be clear.<br>
My points are: 1) Be more ''clear''.  2) Cite!  3) Use editorial knowledge to reject bad sources or to properly interpret their context.<br>
I think the article needs to make a much clearer distinction about when it's talking classical and when it's talking GR.  It's awfully muddled (and uncited) in that regard as it stands now.<br>
Anyway, I know I made a lot of edits to the Earth Gravity section at once.  I know this can be disconcerting.  I'll back off a little to give it time to settle.<br>[[Special:Contributions/100.0.124.147|100.0.124.147]] ([[User talk:100.0.124.147|talk]]) 00:42, 1 March 2015 (UTC)


Regarding what [[geodesist]]s do (as you mentioned).  It seems you are saying they measure free accelerations on the surface in a surface reference frame.  In classical gravity, we wouldn't call that "gravity", but rather the ''net acceleration'' in a surface frame.  We would "know" that the the net accel is a sum of Earth "actual gravity" (the GMm/r2), the centrifugal pseudoforce, the gravity of the Moon, Sun, bystanders, etc.  Forgetting about CF for now, we wouldn't say ''earth's gravity'' includes the effects of the Moon, Sun, etc..  Rather we would say the ''net accleration at the surface'' includes the effects of the Moon, Sun, etc..  Similarly, we (lay people and those not fully versed in GR) would conceive of "earth's gravity" as the component of acceleration in an unaccelerated frame (such as in space not moving with the surface) which is due only to the Earth's mass.  If some models of gravity ''equate'' pseudoforces  with gravity, it should be made ''extremely clear'' when we're talking in those terms and when were not.

But even then, I would suggest that the idea of "gravity ''being the same as'' pseudoforce" is perhaps ''not'' a firm and fixed idea of gravity and that perhaps it should ''not'' be discussed that way in the article.  Or if it is discussed, it should be only in it's own separate section.  How about that one, eh?  :-)  [[Special:Contributions/100.0.124.147|100.0.124.147]] ([[User talk:100.0.124.147|talk]]) 01:21, 1 March 2015 (UTC)


I looked more closely at those two refs Cesiumfrog gave above and it's pretty clear that neither of them are calling the centrifugal (pseudo)force the ''same thing'' as gravity in a GR sense.  All they're doing is using a term of trade, a convention.  In the practice of [[geodesy]] it seems, or at least in the context of those refs, the term "gravity" is simply the name given to the net acceleration at some point (usually on the surface).  It's use implies the sum of the gravities from Earth/Moon/Sun/etc. as well as centrifugal pseudoforce from rotation.  Nothing about the way it's used there implies a GR ''equality'' of the CF as actual gravity.  Similarly, they also don't suggest that the Moon's gravity as felt on Earth should be thought of as "Earth's gravity" just because it affects a measurement of net acceleration on the surface of Earth.  We need to apply our knowledge as editors so as to not simply copy things like this out of context if it would change the meaning or make it ambiguous (as it currently does).

:General relativity seems to me to be a red herring here.  In my opinion, the main problem with the article's section on Earth's gravity is simply its failure to clearly distinguish between the force per unit mass due solely to the Earth's gravitational attraction and ''[http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Apparent_gravity effective gravity]'', which is the force per unit mass resulting from the sum of the Earth's gravitational attraction and the centrifugal force induced by its rotation.  The two physics text-books I checked were also both very sloppy in making the distinction, but when they talked about the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth, it was clear that they had to mean the acceleration ''relative to that surface''—i.e. ''effective gravity'', and ''not'' the force per unit mass due solely to the Earth's gravitational attraction.
:The centripetal acceleration of the surface of the Earth  varies from a maximum of  0.0339 m/s<sup>2</sup> at the equator to 0 m/s<sup>2</sup> at the poles, and reduces the strength of effective gravity by an average of 0.0339/π = 0.0108  m/s<sup>2</sup>.  It is clear from section 1.3 of [http://www.space-electronics.com/Literature/Precise_Measurement_of_Mass.PDF this reference] that the figures of 9.78 m/s<sup>2</sup> quoted by the article as the "force of gravity" at the equator—which ''should'' be "acceleration due to gravity", or "force per unit mass of gravity" at the equator—and of 9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup> as being 5 parts in 10,000 too large for the gravitational acceleration at a latitude of 45° are those for ''effective gravity'', and ''not'' for the raw gravitational attraction of the Earth.
:It is also ''not'' true that effective gravity includes the gravitational effects from the Sun and the Moon.  The forces resulting from those effects are ''[[tidal forces]]'', which vary in both magnitude and direction at any point on the Earth, with periods of one solar and one lunar day, respectively, and whose maximum magnitudes are utterly negligible in comparison to that of effective gravity (typically, being 0.52 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g and  1.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g, respectively, according to the linked Wikipedia article).<br>
:'''P.S:'''  On performing my own calculations of the magnitudes of the tidal forces, I find that their daily maxima vary quite substantially over longer time periods.  The maximum solar tidal force varies from 4.9  × 10<sup>−8</sup> g at the Earth's aphelion to 5.4 × 10<sup>−8</sup> g at its perihelion.  The maximum lunar tidal force varies from 0.96 × 10<sup>−8</sup> g at the Moon's apogee to 1.41 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g at its perigee.

I like the way you're thinking.  My main point was about being clear as to what's included and what's not included in the term "gravity" whenever the term is used.  I mentioned the Sun/Moon/CF as examples of things affecting the net accel relative to the surface that aren't "earth's gravity".  Indeed Sun and Moon gravity are super small, but that's not why they shouldn't be included.  They shouldn't be included because they're not "of Earth".  My other point was that the centrifugal pseudoforce should not be included because it isn't ''actually'' gravity.  We shouldn't say (or suggest via unclear writing) that any of Sun/Moon/CF effects is included in something called "Earth's Gravity".<br>
Regarding GR as a red herring, yes.  As I read it, GR takes a back seat to clarity in what I'm saying.  It's just the route toward viewing pseudoforces (PF) as gravity (if I understand correctly).  But, the idea of pseudoforces as gravity (and vice versa) is not a settled one (I think).  And so, the centrifugal pseudoforce shouldn't be included in something called "gravity".<br>

:''The discovery and application of Newton's law of gravity accounts for the detailed information we have about the planets in our solar system, the mass of the Sun, the distance to stars, [[quasar]]s and even the theory of [[dark matter]].''

Two problems with this: (1) as mentioned elsewhere in this article, it does not account for ''all'' the detailed information about the planets, in particular about Mercury. (2) Presumably due to grammatical inadequacies, the passage wrongly claims that application of Newton's law accounts for the mass of the Sun, accounts for the distance to the stars, and accounts for the theory of dark matter.

== Gravity vs Gravitation  ==

I think it's important never to confuse gravity with gravitation. Gravity is the hypothetical force that causes gravitation. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity stipulates that gravity does not exist; a theory that has tested positive for 100 years. Whilst gravity may not exist, gravitation certainly does! Equally, I think it's important never to refer to gravitation as a force. Such confusions can hinder one's understanding of this subject. Can anything be tweaked on this page to reflect this?

I see very few changes needed, though: I've changed one, and the statement in the lead ("'''Gravity''' (also called '''gravitation''') ...") might be rewritten (e.g. to something like "'''Gravity''' (the origin of '''gravitation''') ...").

Gravity, the hypothetical force behind gravitation, does not exist according to general relativity (the current and most accepted theory of gravitation). Gravity, when used to mean gravitation, exists in that it keeps our feet on the ground and is ultimately the creator and powerhouse of the universe. The opening sentence "Gravity (also called gravitation)" is untrue but the reverse is certainly true in that gravitation is often called gravity.

:Don't get too particular about the use of words until you have proposed a clear alternative. Until then, we need to keep using "gravity" and "force" to have a broad meaning, especially insofar as we want to describe general relativity. We can't just say "gravity doesn't exist in general relativity". In the broader sense of the word "gravity", it ''does'' exist and is described by general relativity; it just does not take the classical form. As I've pointer out, the Riemann curvature tensor describes a real-world quantifiable phenomenon, and can be called "gravity". It is a tensor field, in exactly the same way as other fields such as the electromagnetic field is a tensor. And just like the electromagnetic field, it also has a source (the stress–energy tensor in place of the four-current tensor). Just like the electromagnetic field results in to electromagnetic effects, the Riemann curvature tensor (gravity) leads to gravitational effects (gravitation). So stop saying that gravity doesn't exist according to general relativity in a sense distinct from gravitation.  I have no issue with "gravity" meaning the curvature of space–time, though I would like us to clearly qualify the term "force" as being rather loosely interpreted. —[[User_talk:Quondum|Quondum]] 18:34, 26 April 2015 (UTC)

::I agree.  By the way, if you wanted to be equally "politically correct" you could make a similar argument for other forces.  There is no such thing as "force" in quantum mechanics.  When a hammer hits a nail, what's really happening is the atoms in the hammer are exchanging virtual photons, which carry momentum, with atoms in the nail.  When a magnetic field rotates the armature of an electric motor, the electrons in the armature winding are really exchanging virtual photons with the stator winding.   [[Newton's law]], [[Coulomb's law]] and the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]] are all false, approximations of underlying quantum equations which don't include "force".

The superposed state of small "cats" has been demonstrated directly in the form of large molecules. If you only accept the smallest versions (e.g. an electron taking two paths), you still end up with the theory becoming inherently approximate (i.e. incomplete). But you're in good company: Roger Penrose's proposal is that when the gravitational energy difference between two states (and hence the geometry of space differs) on the Planck scale, that an objective collapse occurs.  This does not fully solve the problem at small scales, but would prevent substantial differences of geometry being superposed.

::::::{{reply to|Mfb}} The double slit experiments involve propagated particles. Propagated particles lose all properties of matter and adopt wave properties from the time they are emitted until the time they are absorbed. How do propagated particles (waves) compare with the geometry of spacetime (caused by the uneven distribution of particles)?

::::::{{reply to|Quondum}} The thing is, if you want to observe a particle to find out information about it, the particle has to interact with other particles in order to convey the information you seek. This involves propagating the particle or propagating a particle at it. Simply 'observing' a particle can change it's properties so we rely on probabilities. There's nothing magic about it; there's certainly no 'cat' in two simultaneous states of mortality. An electron doesn't take two paths (as in the double slit experiment). The electron ceases to be an electron between the times of emition and absorbsion. The electron becomes a wave.

:::::::Well, then, you are admitting that Schrödinger's cat exists in a superposition of states and denying it in the same breath.  You can't have it both ways.  Are you familiar with the [[quantum eraser experiment]]s? These demonstrate that a system does not (magically!) decide between being a particle and a wave; the simultaneous states of mortality (if that is what you want to call it) are an unavoidable conclusion. Anyhow, this is not the place to be pontificating on the merits of any particular interpretation of QM. The problem of unification of GR and QM is notable and widely recognized. Whatever your personal opinions about the validity of QM interpretations, the general point that the two most successful theories of physics are considered incompatible in their current form does belong here. —[[User_talk:Quondum|Quondum]] 16:58, 1 May 2015 (UTC)

I don't believe the Schrödinger's cat problem, no. And a quanta is never a wave and a particle at the same time. A particle is obviously extremely small and indivisible. When propagated, the particle becomes a wave, a two dimensional entity with the diameter equal to it's wavelength and inversely proportional to it's frequency (or energy). If an electron is emitted at the energy of 100MHz for example, it will cease to be an electron and become a wave with a diameter of 3 meters. Plenty wide enough to penetrate both the double slits at the same time.

My original query was to ask why GM and QM not being compatible is a problem. I Still don't see that it is. [[User:The oracle 2015|The oracle 2015]] ([[User talk:The oracle 2015|talk]]) 19:26, 1 May 2015 (UTC)

== Second paragraph: ==

If gravity is not a force then what causes the object to move (fall) in a straight line through curved space-time. Isn’t curvature just a bent path in the absence of any force which neither can deliver / give force nor has the power to stimulate an object until and unless there is an external unbalance force acted upon it. 

Therefore the word “'''consequence'''” in the second line is not enough to comprehend gravity described by Einstein without referring to the source of momentum.

:Do you have an expectation that a couple sentences should be "enough" explanation for anyone to comprehend General Relativity? (And why do you think momentum is related?)

:FYI, have you ever played with an [[accelerometer]]? It provides concrete measurements that the free-falling object experiences the absence of any real net force, and that "at rest on the earth's surface" is not an inertial frame of reference; the inertial frame is the one where the "free-falling object" is stationary (and earth's surface is accelerating). This is only the starting point for GR.. (really you also want to be conversant both with four-dimensional tensors and differential geometry..) [[User:Cesiumfrog|Cesiumfrog]] ([[User talk:Cesiumfrog|talk]]) 11:49, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

Accelerometer isn’t a natural or a single object which can detect its own acceleration by the virtue of its name but it is its internal mechanism which may or may not report acceleration depend upon its status (static or dynamic). Since, all objects free fall at the same rate of acceleration therefore the Matryoshka Doll parts of accelerometer which are responsible for producing signal losses contact with each other as gravity accelerates them equally and hence reports zero acceleration. Further, are the foundations of all buildings wrongly designed in Newtonian mechanics if accelerometer registers 1g upward on the surface of earth. Similarly, if Einstein’s “g” [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Equivalence_principle&oldid=673075220#Development_of_gravitation_theory_in_a_nutshell: (rocket, elevator and gravity)] is more natural then why Newtonian “g” is still applied in many engineering designs.

Neither object impels itself to move nor a curved space-time tells object to move in the absence of any force therefore I was just thinking that doesn’t curvature controvert the law of inertia e.g. if an object stays at rest on the curvature then shouldn’t it maintain its rest position instead of free falls (not caused by a force) in natural motion along a geodesic through curved space-time (just a path not source of generating motion) - my last reply  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/162.157.210.127|162.157.210.127]] ([[User talk:162.157.210.127|talk]]) 19:08, 21 July 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Semi-protected edit request on 7 November 2015 ==

{{edit semi-protected|Gravity|answered=yes}}
<!-- Begin request -->
The equivalence principle is not correct for a charge in a gravitational field does not radiate while an accellerated charge in a non-inertial system does. This was written in the book The Quantum Theory of Gravitation (2003) by Vasily Yanchilin. He also argues that rest mass is not constant like the general theory of relativity maintains, because a cloud of particles will compress due to mutual attraction and then velocities increase. If the rest masses would remain constant then the inert masses become bigger and thus the inertia of the whole cloud increases. But it is impossible that the momentum of the inert mass of an isolated cloud of particles gets bigger.
The russian scientist offers new theory based on the hypothesis that mass reduces the Heisenberg uncertainty: In the half of a particle nearest to an external mass there will be less quantum mechanical transitions to the farthest half than from the latter to the nearest half. Net result is movement of the particle towards the external mass.
Big mistake in Einstein's general theory is that time is not connected to physical processes: Everybody agrees that near mass the unit of length shrinks and thus atoms become smaller. Which means higher frequencies of emitting electrons. Time is bound and measured to such.
Another reasoning is that a photon passes mass according the principle of least action with as big steps (oscillations with low frequency) as possible and a minimum of these. That is why it curves around mass through a zone where time runs slower.
The special theory of relativity stays valid if understood thus that c is the same in all directions at a certain time and a certain place because it is bound to the potential of the total mass of the universe (hypothesis), which decreases with the expansion of the universe. C becomes zero at the edge of the universe; there everything looses speed and direction, gets into a pure quantum mechanical state, called chaos by Vasily Yanchilin. Read what he thinks of negative energy! (Little bit more on www.janjitso.blogspot.com 11 september and before).
So you may add to your list this fabulous theory, explained didactically very well in the book.

== Vector Sum claim is false ==

'''The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:(a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference.'''

This claim is false, neither (A) nor (B) are true. Rotational vectors which might impart momenta either toward the direction of rotation, against the direction of rotation, or tangent to the direction of rotation have '''zero''' to do with the curvature of space-time from '''any''' point of reference. That is true even when Newtonian models where gravitons or gravitinos are exchanged between the Earth and every other object in the light cone of the expansion phase of the Universe are used to describe gravitational collapse. 

Claim (A) supposes Newtonian attraction models employing gravitons and/or gravitinos being exchanged among hadrons, a model which has been replaced by Einstein's confirmed curvature model. Claim (B) is flat out wrong.

A body that is being flung away from a gravity well through centrifugal vectors is not being acted upon by any "force," but also the curvature of space-time is not being affected by the rotation of the object causing the gravity well -- outside of frame dragging, obviously, and other non-classical effects. 

The effect we call "gravity" on Earth is the result solely of the curvature of space-time, and even if the Equator were rotating just below local escape velocity and Alice where to jump in to the air and impart enough momenta to be flung in to space, the accumulative momenta of the centrifugal effects and Alice's leap have zip all to do with the curvature of the well the Earth sits in as a result of the curvature of space time. The shape and density of the gravitational bending of space-time is not altered by the rotation of the Earth in any way.

== Article should clarify these points ==

When my contribution to the New Alternative Theories section, "Field Alignment theory", was rejected, I was accused of "...Every great new idea in science began with someone knowing the existing science. You clearly do not know it" Despite my having a chemical engineering education and having spent several years researching a variety of physics topics, this is undoubtedly a valid accusation. One reason why is that because I lack affiliation with any academic institution, I must pay to read articles in scientific journals. Therefore I am forced to rely on sources of information such as the Wikipedia article on gravity. As with many Wikipedia articles, the "authoritative" viewpoint is presented, but there is little that would help an ignorant person such as myself understand more deeply why this viewpoint is correct. Specifically, in the Gravity article, gravitational time dilation is mentioned. However no explanation is provided for how gravity can possibly influence time. It is obvious that gravity would have an effect on timekeeping devices such as water clocks or sand glasses, but one would expect stronger gravity to shorten, rather than dilate the time measured by such devices. Many types of devices are, or have been used as timekeeping devices; everything from the aforementioned sand and water clocks, to spring-driven watch movements, to even smoothly running engines. How can gravity possibly affect all the myriad devices used to measure time? Does gravity only affect a certain type of clock, or is "time" being used as a pseudonym for change in general? How about what was possibly the first type of clock invented by humanity - the sundial. This device depends on a steady rate of rotation of the earth relative to the sun. Does the varying gravitational force applied to the earth by other solar system bodies including the sun and planets affect the time measured by a sundial?

Another gravity-related point that I, and probably many others, are curious about is the subject of this article: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/30/earths_core_is_younger_than_its_crust/ Does this mean that due to gravitational time dilation, the earth was hollow inside for 2.5 years before it had a core? Or that the sun was hollow inside for 39,000 years? How could it mean otherwise?

Additionally I was informed that original research is not accepted. If the research is not original, does this not mean that it is in effect plagiarized?
How about this article: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160518120254.htm#.V0BQLvErD_M.google_plusone_share ? This article presents the idea that according to Einsteinian relativity, the earth could be regarded as rotationally stationary, while the rest of the universe revolves around it. This is far from a new idea. According to historians, it was proposed by Ptolemy around 2000 years ago, yet the article makes no attribution to Ptolemy. What would be the Wikipedia policy on this?
