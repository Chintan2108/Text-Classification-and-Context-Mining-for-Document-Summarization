Where can i downloud ansi,
Is  the ansi cryptical secret?

ANSI is not a secret, it is a way of encoding the symbols we use in our every day language into numbers.  These numbers are useful since digital equipment only store numbers and they are stored in sets of 1's and 0's, which typically there are 8 of these bits (1's and 0's) in a byte (a character), the ANSI table provides a means to translate these numbers into symbols and vice versa.  

I hope this helps!  If you want to learn more about these tables, since there is more than one table for doing this; I would suggest looking at [[ASCII]]. - [[user:paulschou | Paul Schou]]

ANSI has another 128 characters, ASCII only does 128 [[Special:Contributions/202.160.118.227|202.160.118.227]] ([[User talk:202.160.118.227|talk]]) 10:31, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

= Request distinction between ANSI (Windows code page) and ISO-8859 =

The definition suggests that there are subtle differences, what are they? [[Special:Contributions/202.160.118.227|202.160.118.227]] ([[User talk:202.160.118.227|talk]]) 10:31, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

In 2004 Douglas A. Kerr published an article describing the differences between ANSI, ASCII and ISO-8859 [http://doug.kerr.home.att.net/pumpkin/ASCII_ANSI.pdf The ASCII and “ANSI” Character Sets]. --[[User:Ansiansiansi|Ansiansiansi]] ([[User talk:Ansiansiansi|talk]]) 14:28, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

== Suggest 4 possible wiki links for [[American National Standards Institute]]. ==

An [[User:Nickj/Link_Suggester|automated Wikipedia link suggester]] has some possible wiki link suggestions for the [[American_National_Standards_Institute]] article:

* What about the ANSI art groups, such as ACiD and iCE?  This was *HUGE* part of the [[Bulletin Board System|bbs]] subculture.  ANSI art groups released monthly art packs starting in the late 1980s, and some of these groups still release art packs to this day.  Jason Scott covered this in his BBS documentary, and it was an extensive subculture that still exists today. Many remember it. Of course, only BBSers...

== Two important basic questions ==

Can anyone answer these two questions about the ANSI 0rganization:

* How many total permanent staff do they have in Washington, New York and other countries?  (This seems to be a well-hidden secret and it is not even discussed in their annual reports).

*When did they stop naming standards "ANSI xxxx" and start naming them American National Standards (ANS) ?

: (Better late then never ...) [[Talk:Triple_DES#ANS_or_ANSI_X9.52]] includes some information about ANS vs ANSI.  The best I could get from them was "... at some point in the last few years". [[User:Mitch Ames|Mitch Ames]] ([[User talk:Mitch Ames|talk]]) 10:47, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

== out of date? ==

"For example, standards make sure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe."

Could make this more upto date by using memory cards for cameras (e.g. SD, SDHC etc.) as the example instead of film...

== New example ==

Please give better example:

"For example, standards ensure that people who own cameras can find the film they need for that camera anywhere around the globe."

people use digital cameras now. --[[User:Aleksd|Aleksd]] ([[User talk:Aleksd|talk]]) 17:27, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[American National Standards Institute]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&oldid=671282065 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20081202011754/http://www.citationtechnologies.com:80/alliances/ansi/ to http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi
