==Blanking and redirecting==
SuzanneWeinstock, you shouldn't blank this article. You are entitled to create an [[Online Savings Account]] article about the ''account'' but that doesn't mean that the [[virtual bank]] article about the ''institution'' should be deleted and replaced by a redirect.  -- [[User:Airodyssey|AirOdyssey]] ([[User talk:Airodyssey|Talk]]) 04:52, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

==Overlinking==
Gautam, the reason why I deleted the wikilinks to the banks themselves is because the name of the virtual banking division already redirects to the bank itself in that particular case. It is deceiving for someone viewing the page to realize that two separate links redirect to the same page. See [[Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context]]. -- [[User:Airodyssey|AirOdyssey]] ([[User talk:Airodyssey|Talk]]) 01:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

== History section ==
The [[Virtual bank#History|history section]] of the article does not have an encyclopedic tone, contained outdated links which, when abandoned, turned out to be advertising portals, and has no Wikilinks (except the one I just added for RBC). I believe it reads like an advertisement. -- [[User:Airodyssey|AirOdyssey]] ([[User talk:Airodyssey|Talk]]) 05:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

AirOdyssey - The links in the history section are out-dated because those banks have now closed down. A virtual bank's identity is its website. If you feel that the article is not up to the standards please delete the entire section. I am a newbie and not much coversant in editing articles in Wikipedia, but, here is my opinion - when you talk about history of a virtual bank you have to mention its website. Otherwise you are better-off not talking about its history. -- [[User:Guruchimi|Guruchimi]] 20:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Redundant definition ==
I deleted the definition which was added and quoted from someplace else, not only because it added no value to what was already the article's first sentence, but also because as per [[WP:MOS]], the first few lines of an article MUST have the name of the page in bold, and explain in one sentence or so the whole concept. -- [[User:Airodyssey|AirOdyssey]] ([[User talk:Airodyssey|Talk]]) 05:54, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

==List Needs Pruning==
By definition, many of the banks on here are not virtual banks. Some are ''extensions'' of traditional banks, while others (like [[Washington Mutual]]) are traditional banks themselves. I'll prune a few on lunch break. [[User:Sidatio|Sidatio]] 17:56, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

== missing first direct bank ==
This article is sorely missing a reference to the worlds only proper and successful direct bank  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">â€”Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/164.53.218.31|164.53.218.31]] ([[User talk:164.53.218.31|talk]]) 14:09, 15 September 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Merge==
I propose we merge [[Branchless banking]] into this article it appears to cover the same subject in most respects and I feel direct bank is the more common term. [[User:Sargdub|Sargdub]] ([[User talk:Sargdub|talk]]) 02:25, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
