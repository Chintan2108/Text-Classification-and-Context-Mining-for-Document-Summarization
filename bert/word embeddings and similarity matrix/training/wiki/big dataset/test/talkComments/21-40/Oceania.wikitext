== Main Articles ==

There are something like 70 main articles listed on this page, including six "Religion", six "Economy", and five "Culture" articles.

The obvious solution is to make new articles at pages like [[Culture of Oceania]] with content from the existing main articles.  If people support this idea, I may try to do it on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 02:20, 30 July 2017 (UTC)

:I believe that "Oceana" includes islands in the Indian Ocean, such as the [[Kerguelen  Islands]], [[Mauritius]], [[Réunion]], and the [[Seychelles]]. Furthermore, from the point-of-view of the [[Olympic Games]] and others, Oceana includes the [[Falkland Islands]], [[St. Helena]], [[Ascension Island]], the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[the Bahamas]], and [[Puerto Rico]].[[Special:Contributions/47.215.180.7|47.215.180.7]] ([[User talk:47.215.180.7|talk]]) 00:22, 23 March 2018 (UTC)

== Focus of map ==

The map focuses on the Australasian part of Oceania, omitting territories such as Hawaii and the Juan Fernández islands off Chile which are specifically mentioned in the text as being part of this continent. It would surely make more geographical - and linguistic - sense if the map centred on the Pacific, with Australasia off to the left. If this were an article on Australasia, that would be another matter. Oceania is essentially a oceanic continent, and I feel the map should reflect this.[[Special:Contributions/213.127.210.95|213.127.210.95]] ([[User talk:213.127.210.95|talk]]) 16:04, 4 February 2018 (UTC)

== Proposed merge with [[Australia (continent)]] ==
In the sense of "continent", "Australia" is just a confusing term for "Oceania", and I have never seen an atlas which excludes New Zealand from Oceania. '''[[User:Lojbanist|Lojbanist]]''' <sup>[[User talk:Lojbanist|remove cattle from stage]]</sup> 23:34, 31 March 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - English Wikipedia uses the 7-continent model in which Australia is a continent and Oceania is a region which includes most of the islands of the Pacific. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 23:55, 31 March 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - As someone from Oceania but not Australia I can catagorically say that there is no support for the concept that Oceania is ever decribed as a continent.  Oceania is the regional grouping of the Country and Continent of Australia plus the islands of the central/south Pacific. The same concepts exist in other groupings but the names are in those cases the same.  Borneo is in Asia (grouping) but not part of Continental Asia.  Japan same.  Ireland is part of Europe, but not part of Continental Europe.  Iceland and Madagasgar same  (more questionable though because of distance).  When it comes to the Pacific the distances from Australia are huge -  New Zealand is thousands of km away from Australia, Fiji further, Tahiti even further, the distance to Hawai'i is extreme, in this case the name Oceania for the regional grouping is not the same as the continent (the smallest continent) within that grouping, Australia.  The concepts are distinct and cannot be merged.   [[User:Andrewgprout|Andrewgprout]] ([[User talk:Andrewgprout|talk]]) 04:34, 1 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - The model I was taught was that Australia was a continent, the islands of the Pacific (including NZ) are just islands (not part of any continent), and that Oceania was just a convenient grouping. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 11:17, 1 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - Oceania is a region which is used to represent the cultural, and economic connections of several areas, which includes the islands in the area and New Zealand, which is on the (disputed) continent of Zealandia, not the Australian continent (also known as Sahul). Sahul is a major piece of land that is categorized as a continent. It is the continent of Papua New Guinea, Australia, and a part of Indonesia. They're not the same thing. [[User:Emil Sayahi|- Emil Sayahi]] ([[User talk:Emil Sayahi|talk]]) 21:02, 4 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - You can might as well delete the articles of [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], and merge them with [[Eurasia]]. Australia is a bona fide, geological continent in itself, just like the other six continents. Oceania, on the other hand, is more of a cultural and social constructed region, with no real or tangible borders, unlike the continent of Australia. Not to mention, the Australian continent has its own distinct wildlife and ecology. It will be a huge and uneducated loss in the geographical department of Wikipedia if the article were deleted/merged. [[User:Meganesia|Meganesia]] ([[User talk:Meganesia|talk]]) 14:26, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
::Off topic, but I could almost get behind the merging of Asia and Europe, as those are not "bona fide, geological continent[s]", but more "cultural and social constructed region[s]". --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 15:10, 10 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - These are two separate things and deserve two separate articles. Australia is a continent and Oceania is a geographic region including the continent of Australia. [[User:Rreagan007|Rreagan007]] ([[User talk:Rreagan007|talk]]) 04:01, 11 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - per all above - reasoning explained in enough ways to show such an idea is basically wrong [[User:JarrahTree|JarrahTree]] 04:03, 11 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - They are two different things. [[Special:Contributions/2001:8003:862E:1200:E965:F59E:770A:E44|2001:8003:862E:1200:E965:F59E:770A:E44]] ([[User talk:2001:8003:862E:1200:E965:F59E:770A:E44|talk]]) 06:31, 11 April 2018 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - I wonder if this is a situation that would benefit from a separate page along the lines of [[Terminology of the British Isles]] or a section such as [[Scandinavia#Use of "Nordic countries" vs. "Scandinavia"]] to fully explain all the different terminology (Australia, Australasia, Oceania, etc) and the circumstances in which they are used.

==Edit request==
I hereby request permission to add information in the lead that acknowledges that in many (mostly non-English speaking) countries in the world, a continental model is taught which includes Oceania and not Australia as a continent. Although this is an English wikipedia, we should acknowledge other views. The hatnote should also be removed as it implies Oceania is not a continent. Also, paradoxically Oceania is currently in the continents category while the hatnote says that is not a continent and only Australia is. [[User:Civciv5|Civciv5]] ([[User talk:Civciv5|talk]]) 20:09, 1 July 2018 (UTC)

:I do agree that the fact that Oceania is considered a continent in some continental models need to be explained better in the Lead, and somewhere in the article with sufficient sources. However, we shouldn't turn this article into a continental article. Also, the hatnote shouldn't not be removed in any case, as the purpose of hatnotes is to direct readers to the proper articles in cases of ambiguity, which this most certainly is. The hatnote would be even more necessary if the redirect at [[Oceania (continent)]] is redirected here. This is because many articles where Australia as a continent is mentioned are subject to having the links changed to point to this article. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 22:24, 1 July 2018 (UTC)
::What exactly do you mean by 'turn this article into a continental article', the article is already in the continents category. I suggest that along with changes to the lead and possibly the article, the hatnote should be changed to something like this to avoid bias: Not to be confused with Australia (continent). For other uses, see Oceania (disambiguation).  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Civciv5|Civciv5]] ([[User talk:Civciv5#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Civciv5|contribs]]) 23:42, 1 July 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:A problem with considering Oceania a continent is that Oceania includes (among others) New Zealand. As a matter of physical geography, New Zealand is not part of the Australian continental mass (readily seen by examining seafloor topology). But the larger issue is that the drive to name the continental mass as either Australia or Oceania is essentially political and ideological, and thus cannot have a definitive resolution. Since this is the English Wikipedia, we generally follow conventions chosen in the English-speaking world.

::Basically there are people on the world who do not live on a continent they live on oceanic islands.  The use of the word continent to encompass regional groupings of countries is not the same thing as a continent even though the terms are often used interchagably - Oceania is a way of conveniently defining such a grouping.  The fact that these groupings (except for Oceania and Euro/Asia) are basically the same is the confusing issue.  New Zealand is an example of this conundrum  - either 2500 kms from a continental landmass (Australia) or arguably on the mostly sunken continent [[Zealandia]] [[User:Andrewgprout|Andrewgprout]] ([[User talk:Andrewgprout|talk]]) 19:13, 16 August 2018 (UTC)
::But there is no universally accepted definition of continent, it's commonly defined as one of the large landmasses on Earth, but sometimes it's just a synonym for world divisions. Since there many countries whose educational models teach that Oceania is a continent, it should be at least mentioned in the lead. Something like 'In many non-English speaking countries, Oceania is considered a continent' or something like that. The page should also be re-added to the category 'Continents'.

:::I agree with the first suggestion, but not the second.  Mentioning that many (more likely, "some") non-English speaking countries consider Oceania to be a continent is OK.

== Maps ==

The heavily Australia-centric Infobox map shows the whole of Indonesia as in Oceania.  That may indeed have been conceptually so for a short period historically as "Malaysia" but it has not been so for a long time, and is not included in the article beyond brief mention. Indonesia is not covered as such at all, only its provinces on Papua. 

That map also shows the whole of Philippines; the text says "part of the Philippine islands" and in another place "non-continental volcanic islands of the Philippines" but none of this is included in the regional map or the article detail (populations, economy, culture etc).  It's very confusing to a visiting reader. [[User:Davidships|Davidships]] ([[User talk:Davidships|talk]]) 20:01, 16 March 2019 (UTC)

==  Bonin Islands ==

This article states definitively that "The islands at the geographic extremes of Oceania are the [[Bonin Islands]]...". However [[List of transcontinental countries]] is more equivocal; {{tq|Japan's Izu islands, Ogasawara (Bonin) islands, and Minami Torishima are '''occasionally''' considered Oceanian.}} Should this article be less definitive about the northern boundary of the continent? --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup> 20:01, 25 April 2019 (UTC)
:First, the article is about the region, not the continent. Generally, the extent used in the article is the geopolitical flavor used by the UN. That includes some Japanese islands (the Bonin). There's no particular reason to include other chains closer to Japan as part of Oceania rather than Asia. From a geophysical view, the Izu islands seem to be specifically associated with the Japanese main island continental shelf. Perhaps rephrasing the statement to say something like "for the purposes of this article..."? [[User:Tarl_N.|<b style="color:green">Tarl N.</b>]] ([[User talk:Tarl N.#top|<span style="color:teal">discuss</span>]]) 20:21, 25 April 2019 (UTC)
::"the extent used in the article is the geopolitical flavor used by the UN".  Do we have a reference for the UN's definition of "Oceania"?  I couldn't find one, but it would be nice to have.  Given that there seem to be so many definitions of "Oceania", it's probably a good idea to be "less definitive" about its boundaries.  I just found the following web page [https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-oceania.html], which claims: "Oceania extends to Sumatra, Bonin Island, Hawaiian Island(sic), Rupa(sic) Nui Island, and Macquarie Island. The islands at the geographical ends of the area include Bonin, a territory of Japan, Hawaii, a territory of the US, and Easter Island which belongs to Chile. Also, a relatively smaller geographic area includes Indonesian Papua Guinea on the Australian continent but excludes the land on the Sunda Plate."  This is the first time I've seen Macquarie Island mentioned as being part of Oceania, but it probably makes sense, given that Australia (including the island of Tasmania) and New Zealand are considered part of Oceania.  (Note, BTW, that our own page currently notes the Campbell Islands (farther north than Macquarie) as being the southern extent of Oceania.) [[User:Rsfinlayson|Ross Finlayson]] ([[User talk:Rsfinlayson|talk]]) 20:24, 25 April 2019 (UTC)
:::UN definition - [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ here], click on Geographic regions under the M49 Standard banner and then scroll down a loooong way. It specifies Marshall islands and Northern Mariana Islands, which at one point I thought included the Bonin islands, trying to find that.

::::Thanks for this.  Under this UN definition, the Bonin Islands would ''not'' be considered part of Oceania, because the Bonin Islands are administratively part of Japan, which is in another UN region (Asia). This illustrates the danger of relying solely upon the UN definition, because that's a ''political'' definition, rather than a ''geographic'' one. (I note also that the UN definition doesn't include Easter Island either, as that is administratively part of Chile (South America).) [[User:Rsfinlayson|Ross Finlayson]] ([[User talk:Rsfinlayson|talk]]) 20:43, 25 April 2019 (UTC)
::::{{ec}} Further - [[Mariana_Islands]], under "pre-history" comments that geographically it's part of the [[Izu–Bonin–Mariana_Arc]]. [[Micronesia]], in being described as the northernmost part of Oceania, specifies it includes the North Mariana Islands, but does not list Japan as one of the nations in the geographic region covered, thus it excludes the Bonin Islands. Since Northern Mariana Islands is a national designation, it appears that Bonin islands are not included.

:::::Agree on the dangers of relying on UN definition. But since this is the description of the region, rather than the continent, we can probably bend to geopolitical realities. My recollection of the Bonin islands being part of Oceania came from a recollection of them being considered part of Micronesia, which probably has shifted around a couple of times in the last half-century.

::::::Yes, we should be precise - about the fact that the definition of "Oceania" is vague, and that there's a distinction between the UN's geopolitical definition (which excludes the Bonin Islands, Easter Island, and Clipperton Island), and other, more geographical-based definitions, that include those islands.

I notice also, by the way, that the article lists a precise area "8,525,989 square kilometres" for Oceania, but without giving a reference.  It would be nice to know where this figure came from, because that would (presumably) also give us a geographic definition of the region.

==Inclusion==
Biogeographically or ethnographically or in terms of plate techtonics, the inclusion, as part of Oceania, of Australia/New Guinea ('Papua New Guinea' is a political designation, like 'Haiti/Dominican Republic') might be explained, as it is unusual. New Zealand is in all these senses part of Oceania. But is Australia actually included because of accidents of European 'discovery' or British Empire history? [[User:Wetman]] [ <small> 19:35, 28 September 2003 (UTC) </small> ]

:I'm not sure for which reasons Australia is (or can be) included, but AFAIK it's very common to see it lumped together with Oceania. This doesn't mean that I think it should be. (BTW, Paul Theroux used the name 'Meganesia' for Australia and New Zealand in his book ''The Happy Isles of Oceania''.) OTOH, I thought that ethnographically speaking, New Guinea and the surrounding islands were part of Melanesia (and thus Oceania). [[User:Dhum Dhum|D.D.]] 20:02, 28 Sep 2003 (UTC)

== Australasia ==

Instead of including New Zealand in Polynesia, couldn't we group Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand into one group called Australasia.
:Well, you could, but you'd risk the wrath of everyone in New Zealand. New Zealand does not consider itself part of Australasia - it is in Oceania. Conversely, Australia is a continent, so it can't really be considered part of Oceania if you regard Oceania as a continent. The term Australasia may have some uses when talking politically, economically or - to some extent - in terms of ecology, but geographically Australia is a continental landmass whereas New Zealand and the Poly/Mela/Micronesian Islands are all island chains.

::Well I am a New Zealander and NZ is definatley part of Australasia, and we are part of Oceania. I havent heard of any New Zealanders objecting to being part of Australasia.

Please sign your posts, people. 
Someone has replaced as fairly nuanced discussion of this issue with a simple "Now known as Australiasia." [sic] In the absence of any evidence, I'm reverting it. 172.201.205.3, feel free to discuss this here, preferably logged in though. —[[User:Rodii|rodii]] 02:52, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

:On further reflection, this section still needs clarification. If the differing views of Autralasia and Oceania can't be ironed out (is Australia in Oceania or isn't it?), then should should be acknowledged. Simply stating a pseudo-definitive "Now known as Australiasia" isn't really a solution. —[[User:Rodii|rodii]] 02:57, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

This all boils down to whether the corresponding territories are at all to be considered an independent continent, which in turn depends on whether a continent is defined as a major landmass or one of a set of collectively exhaustive geographic zones. Labelling comes later. The term Australasia does not appear viable other than in a popular context.

:Note that there is a separate [[Australasia]] entry, btw [[User:Rodii|rodii]] 13:57, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

The difference is that Australasia is an officially recognised continent containing at least Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea whereas Oceania is a regional description of the islands in that area which contains countries from the continents of both Asia and Australasia. (rather like North and South America being known as the Americas) Except in this case neither Oceania or Australasia are wholly contained within the other.

Officially recognised continent appears to be a somewhat pretentious categorisation, of what I would rather like to refer to as a semantic attempt to construct a name for what should most adequately be referred to as “the residual of global sector division”.

:The category is often best decided by residents of the country being categorised. New Zealanders and Australians have long been familiar with 'Australasia' referring to common activities. I have belonged to several Australasian organisations in the last 55 years. I think that that includes Papua New Guinea, the half that has been administered by Australia for 70 years (1905 to 1975). [[User:Mozasaur|moza]] 12:37, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Although the ''"bottom-up-approach"'' always has its justification and charm I maintain, that from a theoretical point of view, the application of ''"Australasia"'' still appears just a little bit too arbitrarily invented to be promoted from the regional to the global context just like that. Furthermore this is quite contrary to the case with the similarily hybridic denomination Benelux, where the local opinion, in particual when it comes to the Walloons, is rather sceptic.

: Dear anon at 81.225.114.121, please sign your posts--it get difficult to figure out whether we are talking to one or several people.
: You make some good points. I agree with you (if that is you) about "officially recognized continent"--what is the official body here? (When I was a kid I had a series of books on the continents, and the "residual" one was "Oceania." So that seemed, from my kid perspective, to be an "official" viewpoint, though it was only a kid's book. What seems authoritative often is just a matter of what we first encounter and what uses it's been put to, until we reflect a bit.) The whole concept of "[[continent]]" doesn't really bear close inspection when it comes down to it. So I think we have to agree here that there are several points of view on the subject, and that it is likely to remain contested, so for the purposes of an encyclopedia we should let a hundred flowers bloom and be sure to provide cross-links and critical voices.  That's my take on the issue anyway. I'm not sure exactly what you're advocating, but I'd like to hear it. [[User:Rodii|rodii]] 21:47, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

To articulate my position, the ambiguity when it comes to naming the sixth continent is due to the fact that this actually is not a continent in the same sense as the other ones. It is by no means evident that there are six continents and for example Cervantes mentioned Europe, Asia, America and Africa and afterwards concluded that all four continents had been listed. If there is not a more distinct name for the sixth continent than ''“Australasia”'', the whole discussion grows a bit quasi.  /Copywriter

== Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia ==

I am aware of the difficulties with the three-part division, but does anyone have a cite for the idea that it is "no more recognised as correct by most geographers and scientists"? Linguistically, at least, [[Polynesia]] and [[Micronesia]] are still viable concepts. The idea of [[Melanesia]] is on much shakier footing, however.

Also, the list of places in [[Polynesia]] is incomplete. I suggest either syncing that list up with the articles on [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]], or simply replacing it with links. [[User:Rodii|Rodii]]

No, [[Micronesia]] is not ''a viable concept''. Not in linguistics, at least. This was not a 3-part division, but a 4-part, as [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] who invented it, has proposed 4 parts for Oceania (Polynésie, Micronésie, Mélanésie and… Malaisie, in English Malay). And most modern linguists and geographers consider that division (in 3-part) as obsolete. [[User:Enzino|Enzino]] 19:59, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Enzino, I think you'll have to elaborate. As far as I know, no one has contested the existence of the Micronesian branch of Oceanic, and all the languages spoken in [[Micronesia]] except the outliers [[Yapese]], [[Nukuoro]] and [[Kapingamarangi]] are Micronesian (and in fact very closely related). See [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=531 Ethnologue] for details and a [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=Micronesia&seq=1 map]. (Thanks for the link to d'Urville.) [[User:Rodii|Rodii]] 02:17, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

''No one has contested?'' I do not think that I will have to elaborate. ''Micronesian'' is a branch of Oceanic. But it does not include all the geographic Micronesian region. [[Chamorro]] is not Micronesian. [[Yap]]ese is not Micronesian. [[Palau]] is not Micronesian. And are not closely related. You are confused between ''Nuclear Micronesian'' and the Micronesian Region. And you probably have no better source than Ethnologue. Please, have a look to ''The Lexicon of Proto Oceanic'', The culture and environment of ancestral Oceanic Society, 1. Material Culture, — 2. The Physical Environment. edited by Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond. {{ISBN|0 85883 507 X}} (v. 1) & 0 85883 539 (v. 2). It's not only a concept of outliers (from Polynesia or elsewhere). The history of these frontiers is far more interesting (and delicate) that you could imagine. The 3-Division of Oceanic is a non-sense... [[User:Enzino|Enzino]] 18:36, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:*shrug* Well, if your point is that Micronesia in its putative geographical sense and in its linguistic sense are not completely coextensive, sure. The world abounds with vague but pragmatically useful concepts. (I think your point could be made a little less obnoxiously, by the way. I'll refrain from responding in kind.)

== Map ==

Unfortunately, the map on this page is hardly readable and completely omits New Zealand.

True. Apparently, it was cropped from the CIA World Factbook map in an attempt to exclude NZ and Australia from the definition of Oceania. If someone finds a hi-res version of the picture in the link below, that would be a better choice.

== East Timor ==

I noticed East Timor is in the list. Is it really part of Oceania? If so, then the bit about the only international land border being between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia needs to be updated to reflect the border between East Timor and Indonesia. If not, it should be removed from the list.

== Proposed merge (with [[Australasia]])==

Hi, in order to have the merge discussions at one place, I hv suggested that all discussions about the proposed merge take place here so that continuity is not lost (else, we would end up with discussions on both talkpages - the other talk page being [[Talk:Australasia]] making it difficult to follow who is saying what). 
I believe that the merge is justified because of the following reasons: -
# Both the articles cover similar ground, by and large.
# Duplication of articles is not justified.
# The controversy about the existence of these two terms can be dealt in a separate section in the merged article.
# The controversy about which term is more prefered can be debated. Hence, I have not suggested which article should be retained and which one should be converted into a redirect.

I think the distinction is justified. There are a lot of overlapping spheres within the Pacific, and depending on whether you're talking about colonial history/language/people/climate/sport/politics whatever, the different terms serve to highlight different associations. For example, Australia and New Zealand have a lot in common, but in different contexts New Zealand is more associated with the Pacific Islands, and at other times other groupings are also useful.

== Proposed General Name: Indo-Pacifica ==

This easily encompasses the territories between the East Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific. Sure, one can question the credibility, but a term should define the boundaries of a place. Australia only accounts for the latin Australis for South, and Asia is a large section of the Eurasian landmass. Bubble the terms into the Ocean defined category and it makes it a bit simpler. But one still has to consider the cultural congruencies of the regions...
[[User:Aminatam|Aminatam]] 21:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
:I'm sorry, but I can't make much sense of what you've written here ("Bubble the terms into the Ocean defined category"?). My take on the idea, however, is that "Indo-Pacifica" is a neologism, and thus not suitable for a Wikipedia article (see [[Wikipedia:Avoid_neologisms|WP:Avoid_neologisms]]). People will come here looking for articles on [[Oceania]] and [[Australasia]], because those are recognized terms. No one will search for "Indo-Pacifica". In my opinion, the question of whether those terms really make sense is best left to a critical discussion ''in'' the article, and shouldn't be answered by tinkering with the article namespace itself.

:ASIA-PACIFIC is also a term used for many years, I dont think its that specific enough. PACIFIC RIM is also a useful description for a wider area of interest. I like INDO-PACIFIC as it contains elements of the continental plates that make up the region geologically; The INDO-AUSTRALIS meets the PACIFIC plate under the exact location I write this!! India and South-East Asia are very important influences on this region, perhaps thats related to the Southern Hemisphere part of Oceania more than the Northern Hemisphere part. Indonesia and China are also increasing in importance to this zone, perhaps more evenly distributed though, it all needs checking.

Someone wants to delete Australasia as a heading from the territories table. I've reverted it for now, but it should be discussed here, I guess. Previous discussions have established that some people don't like the term and some do. I don't know of a more neutral term for that region (or any other term at all) and think it's a good idea to have a subdivision in the table. So, discuss, please. It's currently in, why take it out? <b><span style="color: #f33">&middot;[[User talk:Rodii|<span style="color: #669">&nbsp;rodii&nbsp;</span>]]&middot;</span></b> 20:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
:I have not been involved with this page, so I'm new to it. I see no reason to take it out and several to leave it in. For a start, we should have titles for all sub-sections or none and Australasia is the best title for the first sub-section. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 23:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

OK, this issue is apparently spillover from another discussion taking place on the [[Talk:South America]]? This particular article uses the four-part Australasia/Micro/Mela/Polynesia division, but anon [[142.150.134.50]] and [[User:Alinor]] seem to be battling it out about using the UN scheme, which (in Oceania) has "Australia and New Zealand" instead. 142.* keeps asking in edit summaries for people to discuss here, but he/she doesn't discuss here. I'm not sure how to go forward on this. <b><span style="color: #f33">&middot;[[User talk:Rodii|<span style="color: #669">&nbsp;rodii&nbsp;</span>]]&middot;</span></b> 12:04, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
:I've restored this to a slightly revised version with "Australasia" plus a note about how this term is disputed. This is intended just as a starting point for discussion. If we want to change the terminology or take out the heading I don't care, but let's work out a direction before we do any more reverting. <b><span style="color: #f33">&middot;[[User talk:Rodii|<span style="color: #669">&nbsp;rodii&nbsp;</span>]]&middot;</span></b> 16:22, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

On reflection I am going to change my view given above. I think the heading should be "Australia and New Zealand". The places listed are Australia and New Zealand plus some Australian Territories. The term Australasia is sometimes used to include all the places listed under Melanesia, particularly PNG, so Australasia is inappropriate here. We do clearer need some heading. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 22:45, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:Is there a place "Australia and New Zealand" can link to that makes sense? 142.*'s latest strategy was to link to [[Australasia]] but pipe it as "Australia and New Zealand", which sort of makes sense if we're going for "that part of Australasia that's in Oceania" but might be a surprise for someone clicking on that link. This basic problem--that geographical classifications just aren't very tidy--has to come up a lot, especially where national boundaries don't match regional divisions. Our "Micronesia" region contains outcroppings of Polynesian cultures, for example. I'm for being broadly correct and not obsessing over the overlaps and underlaps, and letting people explore the niceties via links. <b><span style="color: #f33">&middot;[[User talk:Rodii|<span style="color: #669">&nbsp;rodii&nbsp;</span>]]&middot;</span></b> 02:19, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

:I just propose to removing the heading as a compromise solution - because "Australia and New Zealand" doesn't look as good title, but also "Australasia" also includes Papua and other Melanesian islands (according to the Australasia page) already listed under Melanesia... [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 10:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

I'm the anon. :)  I agree with you somewhat, R.; this is difficult to address.  The UN system uses "Australia and New Zealand" to classify that particular region.  I presume that "Australasia" was not chosen due to the varying interpretations of that term (e.g., A + NZ + New Guinea, etc.) ... just as much as the other three regions of Oceania are rather loosely defined too (e.g., inclusion of East Timor).  While I'm not wholly resistant to using Australasia for that section (if, for anything, lack of anything better and since some works like Britannics use it to refer to the A-NZ dyad), I'd prefer to use the UN term or to leave it blank since entries below (in that section) clearly indicate one or the other.  I hope this makes sense.  FWIW: I do like your compromise version, R.

As for the other table entries (e.g., South America), recent similar changes have been [[WP:POV|wilfully]] made without any discussion or reasoning as to why the prior versions, which have prevailed for months, are insufficient.  In addition, they are unsourced and contestable since most common publications (e.g, atlases) do not corroborate recent changes.  Thus, the prior versions should hold and I've nothing more to note on that issue.   [[User:142.150.134.65|142.150.134.65]] 16:37, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

: So, is there a consensus about the "easier" issue of Australia/NZ heading? To '''Remove''' it? [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 17:11, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

This is clearly preferable, not only for reasons of simplicity, but above all since the term Australasia, as has thoroughly been established in a previous discussion, is not very viable at all, being some sort of diffuse categorisation regarding the intermediate Pacific regions, with little appeal, as far as the ambition is to maintain a certain conceptual clarity. /Copywriter

: I would like there to be a heading. I'm OK with the Aus&NZ linked to Australasia version or the current version. I am against the delete option (but not in a fight-to-the-death sort of way). <b><span style="color: #f33">&middot;[[User talk:Rodii|<span style="color: #669">&nbsp;rodii&nbsp;</span>]]&middot;</span></b> 04:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

Here's another option: move NZ to the Polynesia section, and change the Australasia heading to Australia. This is a much cleaner classification in my opinion. If NZ stays where it is, then I agree with rodii about the heading. -- [[User:Avenue|Avenue]] 14:07, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:An interesting idea. If we do that we're no longer attempting to follow the UN classification and instead following some sort of ad hoc "culture area" scheme, which could be OK, but invites other kinds of problems (e.g., Nukuoro and Kapingamarangi are Polynesian enclaves within Micronesia (the FSM)--what do we do with them?). But it's not a bad idea, as long as we're willing to avoid getting mired in the details. The UN scheme, while somewhat arbitrary, has the virtue of being by an outside source, so we're not getting into original research issues. As I said above, let's be pragmatic and let the links sort out the details. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Rodii|Rodii]] ([[User talk:Rodii|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rodii|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.</small>
:I also like this proposal. [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 07:37, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

We are indeed operating in a geograpically complex domain, although somehow the rather basic and rarely argued distinction between Remote and Near Oceania appears rather robust, in particular when in comes to Near Oceania, by all standards including merely Australia, New Guinea and the Salomon Islands, which makes Remote Oceania the true residual sphere open to alternative interpretations and categorisations. I don't know whether a stronger focus on this overall division of the Oceanian territories might to some extent make the somehow hard-to-solve Australasia dilemma superfluous. /Copywriter

:I've added an extra note as to the contentious nature of the term "Australasia". A lot of the problems with it are not connected with the "Austral-" emphasising Australia, they are to do with the "-asia" linking some parts of Oceania with a continent that whey have little connection with. I've also added a note in the table saying that NZ is sometimes included in Polynesia and PNG sometimes in Australasia. Personally I favour Avenue's suggestion above, but hopefully what I've done is a reasonable compromise for the time being until this matter is resolved. Count me as another who dislikes the term Australasia, BTW. [[User:Grutness|Grutness]]...''<small><font color="#008822">[[User_talk:Grutness|wha?]]</font></small>'' 01:09, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

The gradually evolving consensus regarding the non-distinct nature of the Australasia geographical category must be welcomed. Apart from the slightly ridiculous, post-colonial character of the name itself, it above all does not add very much clarity when it comes to identifying the relevant sub-sectors of the Pacific map, adequately linking these into world geography.
Copywriter, 20 November 2006

:I guess the prevailing issue to me is that the term ''Australia and New Zealand'' is the term used in Australia and New Zealand for Australia and New Zealand. The term ''Australasia'' is used occasionally but is controversial and pretty much archaic. By happy happenstance the term in current use by Australians and New Zealanders is also the term used by the U.N., our most authoritative source for sub-continental groupings. So there's really no problem except what to link to. I'd not be averse to creating a stub page that talks about Australia and New Zealand as a political grouping. There's plenty to mention. [[User:Ben Arnold|Ben Arnold]] ([[User:217.33.200.148|217.33.200.148]] 13:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC))

Supposedly Australia and New Zealand is the name traditionally having been used to cover the corresponding domains from a political point of view, not only locally, but in Britain as well. Compare for example the party program of the British Labour party from 1950. ''“We in Great Britain stand - in all respects except for distance - closer to our relatives in Australia and New Zealand far away at the other end of the world than we stand to Europe."''  Compare also the motivation of the Australian Nobel Prize winner in literature of 1973, Patrick White: ''“for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has brought a new continent into world literature”''. It is not until recently that it has at all been an issue how the territory shall be named, not to discriminate the somewhat smaller countries in the area. The term Australiasia is indeed an attempt to solve the dilemma, however not a very successful one, as seems to have been agreed.

==New Zealand and Polynesia==
It would seem unfair, almost strange, to place New Zealand in Polynesia, since Niue and Tokelau are New Zealand dependancies. I understand that New Zealand is a part of Polynesia, but I would think that it would be better to have it seperate, much like Australia is listed. I am talking about the Countries and territories of Oceania, that is displayed at the bottom of somepages, such as the [[Oceania]] page, [[Midway Atoll]] etc. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Phoenix715|Phoenix715]] ([[User talk:Phoenix715|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Phoenix715|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.</small>

== Palau ==
[[Image:LocationPalau.png|thumb|map]]
In the first lines of the [[Palau]] article it is written "...it is traditionally considered to be Melanesian". Also, it looks so by virtue of its location. So, should we put it there? [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 06:14, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
:Another "classification leak." I think what that article is saying, but not clearly, is that traditionally Palau was considered Melanesian but more recently was considered part of Micronesia (because it was part of the US Trust Territories). This leaves us with a situation where we either have to decide on where it should go on our own--which could lead to niggling disputes and [[WP:NOR]] issues--or we fall back on some outside authority. Our main outside authority so far has been the UN.

:By the way, see the infobox here: [[Template:Pacific_Islands]], which puts Palau in Micronesia and New Zealand in Polynesia. So we already have some inconsistency going on.

:::Sorry, I meant no offence. In hindsight my reply wasn't that tactful. What I should have said was that you are not the only person to misread the article in that way, so it would be good to make it clearer. And, having misread it, you are probably in a better position than most to judge where the article is confusing or unclear.

I'd appreciate any thoughts you have about whether this is clear enough, or any suggestions about how we could improve it. -- [[User:Avenue|Avenue]] 01:25, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
::::Understood. The only parts in the article that mention it are "those parts of Indonesia east of the [[Wallace Line]]" as well as the notes at the bottom. It was a brief enough mention that I didn't notice it until you pointed out that it was indeed there. If as you said I'm not the only person who's asked that before, maybe it should be made clearer with its own paragraph or a more clarifying description. Since I don't really understand why only half the country is considered a part of Oceania myself. After having a read of what the Wallace Line is, which seems to just be a distinction of different animal species, I don't really understand how it relates to defining what is considered a part of Oceania. Maybe pointing out in this article how that all works and citing an official source on it? I don't know. Either way, that's all that's really confusing me. I've always considered all of Indonesia part of Oceania, which is also what I was taught in school. [[User:Orichalcon|Orichalcon]] 10:49, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
:::::I would guess that it's because the continent of Oceania is being defined by geologists - largely in terms of different [[tectonic plates]] - and the underlying reason behind the different species either side of the Wallace Line is that the two regions sit on different plates - the single nation of Indonesia spanning both of them. In the same way that [[Russia]] spans [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and until mid-late 19th Century also had a toehold in [[North America]] ([[Alaska]]). [[User:4u1e|4u1e]] 02:09, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== East Timor is part of Asia, Southeast Asia more specifically. ==  

East Timor is part of Asia, Southeast Asia more specifically, PERIOD!

*Removed your bolding again, please stop that.
*"PERIOD!" is not an argument.
*"Universally accepted," of course, is exactly the problem--along boundaries things are sometimes fuzzy or disputed, and this is one case. Our own article on East Timor says "Contrary to common misconception, most of the inhabitants of archipelagic Southeast Asia are not Pacific Islanders. However, it is worth noting that the eastern parts of Indonesia and Timor-Leste (east of Wallace line) are geographically parts of Oceania." Various other sources, including the UN, divide things up differently. All we can do is report the varying interpretations, and we do that.

'''because of error of appearing/editing notes for both tables are repeated below the second'''

=== Questions to IP 65.x/14x that opposes these tables ===
# You are arguing about the line between Asia and Oceania. You seems to disagree with [[Wallace line]]. Why? What about [[Melanesia]] as distingusher? You seems to disagree with both. Maybe provide alternative path then? 
[[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 10:02, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

Please provide authoritative sources that indicate the Wallace Line is or should be used as the delimiter for Asia and Oceania.  Of course, I do not question its validity -- since Wallace is so short-changed when it comes to the theory of evolution (sometimes credited with Darwin) -- but the table seems to have been revised as such without discussion nor consensus ... and it's not necessarily agreeable.  There are a dozen similar biogeographic lines (e.g., Lydekker).  As well, the Penguin Dictionary of Biology indicates the Wallace Line is not a clear line of demarcation.   Moreover, ecozones are not necessarily synonymous with continents or their regions: the Wallace line is primarily a biogeographic delimiter between the 'Australasian/Oceanic’ and Indomalayan ecozones (since renamed to Arctogea and something else that currently escapes me).  The Wallace line has little relevance phyisographically and almost none geopolitically. 

Speaking of which: no sources have been provided to indicate that East Timor is 'geographically' – again, you mean physiographically -- in Oceania.  (Mind you, I don't necessarily challenge this; see below.)  Timor is separated from the rest of the Australian shelf by the Timor Trench; please source that it is of Oceania.  (The Wp aticle indicates only that it is 'peripherally Melanesian' only.)  And note that (according to Britannica) Australasia is one region within Oceania that (depending on definition) overlaps Melanesia (including East Timor), Micronesia, and Polynesia.  Definitions for Oceania vary: some include Australia/New Zealand (e.g., Natl Geo Atlas print refers to the region as ‘Australia and Oceania’), some exclude both, and some include ALL of the islands of the Malay Archipelago (e.g., East Timor, but also Borneo).  For various reasons, the UN has classified East Timor as being Melanesian, as have other sources (Encyclopedia Britannica) so this should’t be problematic.

Many reliable sources (e.g., Collins Atlas, Natl Geo) include Papua New Guinea in Oceania, splitting the island of New Guinea between Asia and Oceania. SImilarly, East Timor is included in Asia.  The original table – per the cited UN scheme -- delimited the countries this way.  Moreover, retaining the arrangement of the status quo table would reflect representations (e.g., maps, tables) in common publications, so a geopolitical split is not at all incorrect.

Given varied interpretations/definitions for what exactly Oceania is and the above, a geopolitical split per the UN scheme isn’t ideal but IMO better than other more tenuous options presented. [[User:65.92.173.131|65.92.173.131]] 13:50, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:Please, don't use '''political''' classifications for the continental tables (see [[Talk:South America]]) - such as classification that divide the island of New Guinea in both Asia and Oceania - only because the western part is inside Indonesia. Same for East Timor. Until you provide dividing line different than the current one I will continue to revert the table to its '''physical''' version. [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 07:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

::Remember, most sources indicate Oceania is not a continent.  Regarding your cease-and desist 'order', I don't think so.  Not only have you not sourced your assertions -- still -- but you continue to insinuate edits of dubious quality that are not agreeable.  And '''bolding''' text doesn't enhance your position.  Until you do as requested, I see no reason to refrain and will not discuss this further with YOU ... others, please feel free to comment. [[User:65.92.97.9|65.92.97.9]] 20:40, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
:::I don't see any cease-and-desist or other orders. Bolding is used only to show where our disagreement is (see [[Talk:South America]] for details). You provide some sources, but they do not support in any way your wish to change the continental tables from '''physical''' to '''political'''. Oceania is not a "continent" in the sense of a big land-mass. No one argues about this. You make edits and now refuses to discuss them. [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 07:05, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

::::In your riposte above, you have avoided my questions (almost ''ad hominem''), not providing ''any'' [[WP:CITE|reliable sources]] to support your editions to the tables -- i.e., use of the Wallace Line as a delimiter.  While a geopolitical definition isn't ideal, though it is [[WP:CITE|readily cited]], I disbelieve and reject ''this''(YOUR) delineation without cited basis -- as with South/North America, this is what YOU believe the border should be.  In this instance, I defer to the ''Columbia Gazetteer of the World'', a [[WP:V|reputable, authoritative source]] for a [http://www.bartleby.com/65/oc/Oceania.html description of Oceania] (actually an online sister publication, but this is ''verbatim'' from the Gazetteer):

::::*collective name for the approximately 25,000 islands of the Pacific, usually excluding such nontropical areas as the Ryukyu and Aleutian islands and Japan, as well as Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, whose populations are more closely related to mainland Asia. Oceania is generally considered synonomous with the South Sea Islands and is divided ethnologically into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.

::::As well, note the entry for Melanesia in ''Britannica Ready Reference'':

::::*A subdivision of Oceania, it includes New Guinea, Admiralty Islands, Bismarck and Louisiade archipelagoes, Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz Islands, New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Norfolk Island and numerous others.

::::Note the general exclusion of Indonesia, which leads to the Gazetteer's [http://www.columbiagazetteer.org/public/East%20Timor.html entry for East Timor (nee Indonesia)] ('''''emphasis added'''''}:

::::*East Timor ... [occupies] the E half of the island of Timor and the enclave of Oecussi in the W, one of the Lesser Sundas, '''''in SE Asia'''''; 08°50'S 126°00'E.

::::In support of the above, I have edited the tables to include what are usually reckoned in Australasia/Oceania: New Guinea and Maluku islands, excluding East/Timor ''as cited''.

::::There.  And I do not refuse to discuss my edits: I refuse to discuss them with YOU given your ignorance of my requests to provide authoritative sources and repetition of rhetoric.  And until you do, I will defer to cited matter and, if necessary, revoke/revert your edits. [[User:142.150.134.50|142.150.134.50]] 20:31, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

:::::Here. You again push for '''political''' delinations of the continental tables. You just give some lists of islands and say "that's it". This is '''not supported by any non-political''' source or definition of the demarcation line. [[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 15:40, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

::::::Again, what are you talking about?  I am citing relevant text from reputable publications.  Throughout, YOU HAVE NOT provided reliable sources to support your edit warring (e.g., provide one source supporting the Wallace Line as an authoritative delimiter) -- the tables are not organised by true physical/physiographic lines but [[WP:POV|what you believe they are]] ... and I suspect you cannot debate because you are either unwilling or unable to.  At this point, [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:CITE|citing sources]] are key.  I have done that.  Stop gibbering repeatedly, provide reliable sources yourself, and desist.  I will not reply to you further unless necessary and revert any of your edits that are not derived through consensus, discussion, or reliable sources. [[User:142.150.134.61|142.150.134.61]] 15:45, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
:::::::The sources that you provide '''ARE NOT RELATED''' to our disagreement. The data from your sources '''IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN THE ARTICLE'''.[[User:Alinor|Alinor]] 16:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
::::::::Un-un -- I defer to my prior comments. [[User:142.150.134.61|142.150.134.61]] 16:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

==Oceanica==
Who uses this term? I think it was used in the 19th century, and it may be the correct name for the region in some languages, but in English it seems rather obscure.

Should Hawaii and Easter Island get their own entries here?  They are both geographicly in the Oceania "continent" even if they're integral parts of mother countries that are in other continents.[[User:Inkan1969|Inkan1969]] 14:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

Geographically I think it is clear the Hawaiian Islands are part of Oceania, even if politically they are a US state.

== Australia - Country / Oceania - Continent ==

Going through the whole English side of Wikipedia you will understand that one of the 5, 6 or 7 [[continents]] is called [[Australia]], just as the country. In my opinion, this is due to the large presence of people writing from that country. But this is a [[Synecdoche]] and in this case is a unfair behaviour. If I'm in [[New Zealand]] why should I be in [[Australia (continent)]]? For this reason the term Oceania (3 oceans) exists. Confront also Wikipaedia in other languages, or read for example https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html.
I would like to remember the case of people from the US calling America their country.

:::I am from New Zealand, and Australia is, in fact, a continent. I have not properly researched this yet but i believe you will find that a continent is any land mass of a certain size (stemming from the term continuous land). New Zealand however, is not a part of that continent. It has nothing to do with the numbers of people from Australia displaying a bias (which i don't think they did.). A continent is a large landmass (Of which determinant size i am not aware) and Australia happens to be large enough to qualify as one. The reason that it differs from other continents is that it is occupied by a single country. By this definition i believe that the United Kingdom is not geographically a part of the continent of Europe (Hence British people commenting that they are going to "the continent") but are a part of the geo-political area known also as Europe. So to respond to earlier comments.1. If you are in New Zealand you are not in Australia you are on the island state of New Zealand. 2.Of course you can have regions within regions, New Zealand is itself divided into regions which subsequently have regions within them as i believe is the case with any part of the world. A region after all is merely any defined area. 3. Australia is a continent and Oceania is not (It is a region). 4.

:Continents are typically identified by convention rather than adherence to the ideal criterion you mention. Likewise the criterion that each be a continuous landmass is often disregarded by the inclusion of the continental shelf and oceanic islands.

As we have now (see above) finally been able to discard the somewhat ridiculous example of ''"newspeech"'' of the term of Autralasia, time may indeed be mature to question the term Oceania, being a geopolitical unit, whose scope basically extends eastward from Australia. As was remarked above the term does not make sense, since in analogy we would have to refer to Italy as Mediterranea, Europe as Atlantiania and the Earth as a part of Galaxiania, which appears a bit awkward. //Copywriter March 4th

It is not possible to apply the argumentation given by Copywriter because it appears to be invalidated by a serious slippery slope fallacy. Also the assumption of "There is no such thing as an Oceanic continent", as given by Cyberjunkie, cannot be regarded as a definitive standpoint because it does not quote its sources. Please add more to contribute to the discussion. Finally, why should the quotation of the website of the CIA be a mistake? [[User:Gelpiac|Gelpiac]] 15:00, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

The key point I have been seeking to advocate is that as a geopolitical entity, Australasia is not quite as coherent a conception, as would have been desired, to treat it on equal basis as a continent, quasi-continent etc. It may be valid though, that in other contexts it is being generally applied, such as for example in connection to cultural matters. In order to support my point I would like to mention the book by J M Coetze (''"Elizabeth Costello"''), not so old, where there are indeed references such as ''"the foremost contemporary author of Australasia"'', although I would not necessarily call it a continent, but rather a geographical sphere, with some distinction from surrounding territories and in that capacity almost being a one of its kind. //Copywriter August 17th 2007

There ws discussion on this in the [[continent]] article.  Definition of the 'Australia' as a continent is far more prevalent than oceania but there are places in the world where oceania is regarded as a continent.  As for the remark concerning the number of Australian people joining this debate... well you'll probably find a large number of New Zealanders commenting on the New Zealand page too... dah.  But in any case, the comments in the continent article were mostly coming from North Americans.  Despite the odd spurious canadian Atlas using the term 'Oceania' to depict a continent, it seems that in the USA and many other places on earth people are taught that Australia is a continent.  To be honest, the entire classification system is completely arbitrary.  there is no solid definition for what does and what does not constitute a continent [[User:Far Queue|Far Queue]] 00:47, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

No of the alternative denominations in circulation – Australia, Oceania and Australasia – appears to contain a final answer, each of them rather having their specific advantages and proponents. Australia has a certain colonial flavour, whereas Oceania breathes decolonization and Australasia in a way comes out as a sort of political compromise. Provided that the Australasia term after all is in use, also in serious contexts, it might however also be of interest to break it down into components, for example asking wheather it should be understood as an extended Australian sphere or as a sub-territory of the larger entity Asia. Nietzsche referred to Europe as an appendix of Asia and maybe the Australasia school is to be understood as an eastward analogy to this ingenious metaphore. //Copywriter October 6th 2007  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.231.76.234|85.231.76.234]] ([[User talk:85.231.76.234|talk]]) 20:53, 6 October 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Hello All. For all those for "Australia" being the name of the continent, so be it as it appears this is what is presented on wikipedia at present however on the other hand sorry to disapoint anyone against "oceania" but schools up and down the UK will regularly refer to it as the title of the continent - even "Australasia" in some cases.

Although "Australasia" might be part of established terminology - you will find it already in texts by Kipling - I believe it must be possible to rule it out as the most adequate official or scientific denomination. "Australasia" has never been the preferred name among geographers, but rather is a remnant of colonial vocabularly, from this point of view most properly defined
as everything beyond India except for the Far East. This probably is as close to a clearcut definition as it is possible to get. The fact that it has grown increasingly popular ni recent time probably has to do with a resignation to the ambivalence between the competing names "Australia" and "Oceania", well illustrated by the previous contribution. //Copywriter May 20th 2008

# neither [[Micronesia]] nor [[Polynesia]] are now mentioned (after the revert) in the lede (when our [[Oceania]] article specifies that they were both part of the original meaning of the word and are still universally accepted as being part of Oceania?

:The editions to the 'lede' were reverted for a number of reasons:

Your references don't "trump" my references; both have a validity.

I also don't see that whether the Timorese people see themselves as part of Oceania or not is the issue (I agree that the majority seem not to).

No other major compendium does this: in this respect, Wikipedia needn't be different.

The lead, ''per'' [[WP:Lead]] summarises and encapsulates what is in the rest of the article. The rest of the article spends a lot of time summarising the various controversies and uncertainties as to what is in and what is out of Oceania.

== 3O: East Timor ==

A request was made for a third opinion re the inclusion of East Timor. The request noted that there were three editors involved, so this dispute was not "technically" eligable for a 3O:
"''If, after discussion, only two editors are involved, you may list the dispute below in the Active Disagreements section. Otherwise, please follow other methods in the dispute resolution process.''"

3Os are limited to disputes between two editors for good reasons and I see no good reasons to ignore those good reasons. Understand my reasoning? Good.

In any event, I will suggest this much:
One of you linked to [[WP:BOLD]] in your discussion above. I would suggest, instead that you try [[WP:BRD]]. So, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oceania&diff=next&oldid=183054697 this] (15 -> 14) was "bold", [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oceania&diff=next&oldid=183066307 this] (14 -> 15) was "revert", now discuss.

A thought: the info box need not ignore the question. The number of countries (etc.) could reflect the lack of worldwide concensus on the issue, "Countries 14 or 15 (see <nowiki>[[Oceania#East_Timor|East Timor question]]</nowiki>)."
Either that or you can edit war for a while longer, go through various long, long and unpleasent dispute resolution procedures to "solve" the issue, then have it all stir up again in a couple of months.

:I have no problem at all with the infoboxes and tables more clearly reflecting the fluidity and uncertainty in categorising various territories and regions as belonging (or not belonging) to Oceania. Corticopia's ideas to expand and amplify the relevant notes sections are also good.

:Thanks for weighing in.  However, the 'question' regarding East Timor is, AFAIK, only one created on this and related pages and doesn't exist in actuality.
:I'm all for enhancing infoboxes, tables, and related notes as needed.

Shall we put so many figures so as to make it unmeaningful?
:As for BRD, note that the 'R'evert is to a version that includes total figures for Oceania which do not include figures for East Timor (and is therefore incorrect) and retains a contradictory note regarding Melanesia (i.e., East Timor listed in table, with note indicating table excludes East Timor).

However, if logical consistency leads to the removal of these problematical tables and infoboxes by Corticopia, then I wouldn't mourn their loss.

==Sources for Corticopia's allegations==
I believe that good sources have been provided above to indicate that Timor can be considered part of Asia, and part of Oceania. I am not disputing that Timor is part of Asia.

Until such references are supplied, do not continue to revert the article.

:I am not removing East Timor from the article about Oceania, only from the table: as stated many times beforehand, interpretive notes more than cover this off.  I have provided at least five reputable sources above, and you haven't demonstrated why ET/TL should be treated differently than other constituents that may or may not be included in Oceania, or why the continental tables should not be mutually exclusive (like any other compendium).  Moreover, even the 'East Timor' article indicates upfront that "[it] is a country in Southeast Asia" while acknowledging Melanesian influence and culture afterward; this is no different than, say, [[Cyprus]], which is approximate to [[Western Asia]] but has sociopolitical connections with Europe (e.g., Greek influence, member of the [[European Union]]) and, per the UN scheme, is therefore listed ''only'' in the Asia table.  So, continued insistence on indicating otherwise for ET/TL, given the weight of evidence provided, [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|amounts to placing undue weight on this perspective in the table]] and won't be tolerated.  Thus, until ''you'' can demonstrate otherwise and stop being so polemic, do not continue to revert the article.

The ONLY part of Indonesia that should be included in Oceania is the island of New Guinea and its continental shelf.  Adding in the Maluku Islands, which by the way is now cut in half into North Maluku and Maluku, complicates things.  If needed, Indonesia's information here is steadily growing, with its provinces divided into kabupaten (regencies), and its regencies into kecamatan (districts).

I'd like to try and standardise maps across the following articles: [[Americas]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]] (and also, ideally, [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. My preference is for the orthographic projection currently used at [[Europe]] because:
* It's an SVG instead of a PNG, so can be scaled easily.
* New maps can be relatively created from existing SVGs (i.e. Europe's map - or the other SVG maps visible at [[:File:Europe (orthographic projection).svg]] - can be recycled).
* As an orthographic projection it allows the maps to be centred on the relevant continent or territory.

Assuming there's consensus for this, I'll post a request at [[Wikipedia:Graphic Lab/Image workshop]] (unless, of course, anyone volunteers beforehand!)  However, before doing that I do want to check that there is consensus for this at each article affected. Additionally, I'm posting this at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Geography]] to increase the exposure - I'd rather find out if this is a stupid idea ''before'' I start requesting new images ;-)

Personally I think it would be good if the Arctic and Antarctic maps were consistent with the continent maps. I realise that the poles may have different requirements, however.

This proposal is quite a radical proposal, affecting many articles, and deals with areas I don't normally edit in. I'm therefore prepared to be [[WP:TROUT|slapped down]] if I'm stepping on toes!

== Two navbars reverted ==
Editor Gadfium:  The following templates, <nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:English dialects by continent|English dialects by continent]]}} and <nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:English official language clickable map|English official language clickable map]]}}, were added earlier to all the continents excluding Antarctica.  Why is Oceania the only continental area that is not allowed to benefit from these two extremely useful and '''''highly relevant''''' Navbars?  If you'll give them more than a glance, you'll find, for example, that the map template shows the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Australia, New Zealand, Palau, Nauru all as showing English as one of their official languages with a significant population of English speakers, as well as Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea showing English as their official language but with only a small number of English speakers.  In addition, that template shows readers where other anglophone states are, so both that template and the "English dialects by continent" template are excellent focusing tools for general readers of this encyclopedia.  I'm here on the talk page because I abhor edit wars.  However I truly believe in the validity of these templates and their definite relevancy to the articles in which I have posted them.

Unless you can come up with a much better reason than "irrelevant", which just isn't true, then I do want to reinstate these highly useful Navbars!<br>

English is not the only language spoken in Oceania. Unless we also have a similar template for Spanish and French, this would appear to be selective information. Since as you say such templates apply to every continent. they appear to be bloat, and so I will remove them from all continents.

:Remove them if you must, that is certainly your preogative; however, no other editor seems to mind the new Navbars added to the other continent pages.  I suggest you ask yourself why you are the only editor who wants to remove these Navbars from articles.  All the other involved editors either agree with me and support their inclusion or are acquiescent and don't have strong feelings either way.  Why are you the ''only one''?

:*'''PS'''. Nobody would challenge your point about Spanish and French and other languages.  But don't you think there are readers out there who might be interested in the present spread of English throughout the globe?  As difficult as it is to learn (right up there with Russian and German) English is still managing to be spoken in more and more places.  And many of the new English speakers are learning to handle the English alphabet and reading the language better and better.  In any case, this is the English Wikipedia.  How do you know there aren't already such Navbars on the French and Spanish Wikipedias?

:This is the English Wikipedia, but that gives it no special privilege with regard to the coverage of the English language vs other languages.

:Any navigational template should link an article to other articles on closely related topics. Oceania is a continent (or geopolitical region). It should be, and is, linked to other continents. However it is not a language and such language templates are not relevant. 

:According to [[Wikipedia:Navigation templates]], a "navigation template, navbox or topicbox is a grouping of links used in multiple related articles to facilitate navigation between those articles." How is [[Cameroon English]] related to [[Oceania]]?-<font face="cursive" color="#808080">[[User talk:gadfium|gadfium]]</font> 01:36, 13 October 2009 (UTC)
::Gadfium, by pointing out that this is the English Wikipedia, I was merely alluding to the fact that there are other Wikipedia's in other languages.  I would have thought that my question about the Spanish and French navbars would have made this apparent.  There was no bias intended and I am sorry if you thought so.  As a member of the WikiProject countering systemic bias, including language bias, I hope you will accept that my motive was merely to show that the Navbars that you suggested ought to exist might actually already be in place.

::Oceania is indeed a continent in its own right.  It is, however, so much more than just a geopolitical region.  It is a continent of people, and people speak, write and read.  They communicate.  The closely and strongly related topic of anglophone states and the perhaps more politically defined "anglosphere" bring together both those states where English is an official language and there are a significant number of speakers, such as the Marshalls and Micronesias, and those states where English is an official language and yet there are but relatively few who understand English, such as the Solomons and Fiji.  This makes the Navbars highly relevant.

::Cameroon in West Africa is a country where English is an official language, just like all the states in Oceania that are either dark blue or light blue on the map.  It is also a state where relatively few people speak and understand English, just like in Papua New Guinea and the other light blue areas in Oceania.  I'm surprised you didn't get that important relationship without my aid.  These are very valid and relevant navigational aids, and readers of the Oceania article really ought to have access to them when they finish reading this article.

:::You still haven't explained why we should link to English speaking countries but not French or Spanish speaking ones. Saying that there are French and Spanish Wikipedias is missing the point. There are also Chinese-speaking people, etc, although as far as I am aware Chinese is not an official language of any territory in Oceania. 

:::Readers of Oceania are not particularly likely to be interested in Cameroon English, any more than they might be interested in a bird species that occurs only in Newfoundland, even though there are also bird species in Oceania. Is there a difference between the templates on English-speaking countries and a hypothetical template listing bird species by continent?  I'm sure you are not suggesting that we link to every article that has something in common with something that occurs somewhere in Oceania, but this appears to be where your logic leads.-<font face="cursive" color="#808080">[[User talk:gadfium|gadfium]]</font> 04:12, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

::::If we're on the subject of logic, I find it fallacious to simply dispose of a navigation bar on the grounds that not all languages of relevance are represented. If we followed that logic on wikipedia - that all facets must be represented equally or not at all - we'd obviously run into the problem that either we'd have no articles at all or that we'd require someone with god-like writing speed. Either way, personally, I see such a nav-bar as helpful and not a hindrance.

(out). I will not get into it with you about linking to English and not others, for the argument smacks of bias, except to say that one has to start somewhere.  Instead of depriving readers of useful and relevant information, maybe you should be looking into how you can provide the information you think is necessary to balance things out. 

You have NO idea what readers of Oceania are particularly likely to be interested in.  How could you?  People's interests vary far and wide.  You sound like you're judging a whole lot of people whom you don't even know based upon your own apparently myopic views about what they ''should'' or ''shouldn't'' like.  My logic leads toward improving this encyclopedia for readers all over the world.  When I'm wrong, I am not afraid to admit it.  However in this case I feel very strongly that I am correct, and that it is you who are wrong.  You seem to be raising red herring arguments and searching for more.  Getting back to basics, this is a highly relevant template, and it's very sad that you feel you must deprive the many and varied readers of this and the other continental articles of educational information.

I'm done here except to say that you missed a continental article, [[Anglo-America]], which you could have easily found had you opened the clickable map template.  But you seem to rather close your eyes to good solid knowledge and information.  Best of everything to you and yours!<br>

== samoan house of worship ==
The Samoan Bahá'í House of Worship in Tiapapata, 8 km from Apia, Samoa, was completed in 1984 making it the 1st house of worship on an Oceanian island off mainland Australia. Considering there are only 7 Baha'i houses accross the world, i think it would be appropriate to demonstrate 1 of these on this Oceania article as a picture. Even though i agree Baha'i is a fringe religion, it has consistently been at the top of fastest growing religion statistics and also ranks as the 2nd or 3rd largest religion on many Oceanian islands. <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User: Iwanttoeditthissh | Iwanttoeditthissh ]] ([[User talk: Iwanttoeditthissh |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ Iwanttoeditthissh |contribs]])  10:53, 18 May 2010 (UTC) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
:'''Comment''': until 2007 the Samoan head of state was a [[Samoa#Religion|Bahá'í convert]].
:However, there's currently very little in the "Religion" section, and the only image is of the Samoan Bahá'í House of Worship. I'd suggest this does give [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] to Bahá'í at the expense of other faiths. In particular, I'm concerned that the text doesn't cover Bahá'í at all.
:I'd suggest expanding the section, noting that Christianity in all its forms is dominant, but that there are a wide-range of religious beliefs. Bahá'í, [[Malietoa Tanumafili II|Malietoa Tanumafili]]'s conversion, and the Samoan Bahá'í House of Worship could be used to demonstrate the scope of faith in Oceania.
:I'd also suggest trying to get a few Christian images - as a Kiwi I'm biased but I'd suggest that images of [[Rātana]] churches might be good, but other images too.
:This is pretty much a "drive-by" comment, but I have this article (and its talk page) watchlisted, so if I can help do let me know.

::I removed the three photos of temples (two Bahá'í, two in Australia) that were initially added, because they seemed to make our coverage skewed very disproportionately away from more mainstream religions (and irreligion), and probably put too much emphasis on Australia. I would not object to the reinserted Samoan Bahá'í photo staying if the Religion section is expanded somewhat, with some mention of Oceanian Bahá'í followers, and preferably also including a more "mainstream" house of worship. As it stands, I think this photo's relevance is unclear and it may give the Bahá'í faith undue weight, but I won't delete it again just yet. It is a nice photo, and I agree that it could help illustrate the diversity of faiths in the region, especially alongside some explanatory text along the lines suggested above. --[[User:Avenue|Avenue]] ([[User talk:Avenue|talk]]) 11:36, 18 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Pretty much agree fully. I take your point about "mainstream" houses of worship: my thinking is/was that "quirky images" are interesting - a beautifully carved Rātana church would be more interesting than a plain Anglican church in [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]], for example. Thinking it through further, though, you're quite right - the "quirky" images should supplement the "mainstream" images.

::There's diversity in faith in any large region - can anyone name a region/continent or even a country that does not have diversity? Surely it's trivial, and thus the pic is irrelevant. In fact, i don't think a symbol of any house of worship is all that useful to the article, even for the large religions. Such buildings exist all over the world.

:::Well, the images (if any) should illustrate the text, and in that respect may be useful. An image of a place of worship that appears unusual (to non-Oceanian eyes) could certainly be useful (hence my comment about a beautifully carved church compared to a plain church - it's nothing like the typical church in [[Glasgow]], for example).
:::That said, I took a look at other large regions: [[Asia#Religions|Asia]], [[Europe#Religion|Europe]] and [[North America]]. Asia has images illustrating two major religions (Buddhism and Islam), Europe simply has a map indicating which religions are predominant in which areas, and North America has no "religion" section at all. I do think it's worth spelling out religious diversity - we can't assume that the reader will know about this - but whether or not we supplement this with images isn't quite so clear-cut.

::::I think photos can be useful to illustrate the text, as TFOWR says, when they are fairly distinctive to the region. Maybe a locally decorated church would work well here, or maybe churchgoers in the local formal attire. I'd also like to include a video of choral hymn singing (e.g. like [[:File:Fijian_singers_at_Pasifika_2010.ogv|this]], but in a more religious context).

:::::[[:commons:Category:Religious buildings in Tonga|This]] and [[:commons:Category:Religion in Samoa|this]] may be useful, though I didn't notice any photos that matched our requirements (except, maybe, [[:commons:File:Pasilika Tonga.jpg|this one]] (anyone more familiar with Tonga than me care to comment on how representative this picture is? My experience of Tonga is all within NZ...) I've not gone much further in Commons; Fiji, PNG, the Solomons and Vanuatu were going to be my next port of call, if anyone fancies taking a look at Micronesia and the (large) part of Polynesia I've thus far ignored?

== Map ==

We've gotten into a revert war between a [[:File:Oceania, broad (orthographic projection).svg|map of all of Oceania]] (Malay Archipelago thru Polynesia) and a [[:File:Oceania (orthographic projection).svg|map of the Australasian part]] of Oceania (Melanesia, Australia, & New Zealand). Personally, I think that an article on Oceania should be headed by a map of the entire region, and that maps of Australasia should be placed in that article, or given here with a description of being a narrower conception of Oceania. Another map to have would be the UN conception of Oceania, which matches neither map, including as in does Hawaii (currently excluded) and excluding West Papua (currently included). 

The argument for limiting the map to Australasia is that this has been stable for years, but that is not a valid argument for retaining inaccuracies. — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 01:20, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

:The argument you appear to be making is that the Malay archipelago should be added to the territories we currently list as part of Oceania. It would be preferable if you put forward your reasons for this, rather than simply asserting that the map should cover it.-<font face="cursive" color="#808080">[[User talk:gadfium|gadfium]]</font> 02:34, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

::That's the broad definition of the term, as look can find by checking a dictionary or doing a search online for the hundreds of books which use the term that way. There's a narrow conception of Oceania that excludes Australia and perhaps New Guinea, a middling conception that includes them, and a broad conception that includes the Malay Archipelago. There's the UN geopolitical modification that follows current national boundaries. The EB mentions that even Japan might be included as part of the Pacific, but I've never seen a definition that broad in actual use. The current map is identical to Australasia: it doesn't even include not-Australasian Polynesia, and so fits ''no-one's'' conception of Oceanic. It's simply wrong. Since we have different articles on Oceania and Australasia, I would think our maps should distinguish them. To be complete, we should probably have four maps: narrow, middling, broad, and geopolitical, plus perhaps ecozone and others. But if we have only one, it should be the full extent of the region, not a subset that happens to be synonymous with a different article. — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 04:50, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

Are you arguing that the article should adopt the broad definition of the term? If so, please actually put some arguments forward. At the moment, you appear to be arguing that neither map is perfect, which I entirely agree with. However, both maps fail because they don't display the full area of Oceania, which extends over the horizon to the east. The actual territories of Oceania are mostly too small to appear on the maps. Adding territories which are not part of the definition of Oceania as actually used in the article does not help at all.-<font face="cursive" color="#808080">[[User talk:gadfium|gadfium]]</font> 05:26, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

I'm arguing that we should cover the various uses of the term, both those that include the Malay arch. and those which exclude Australia. We could have multiple maps, but IMO a general map should include all the areas included in the region, not just a particular narrower conception. — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]])

===Recent sources that include the Malay archipelago as part of Oceania===

Here are some sources which include the Malay arch. Most, but not all, also include Australia. (There are also many sources which exclude both.) 
*OED (2008): (A collective name for) the islands and island-groups of the Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas, including Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, and sometimes also Australasia and the '''Malay archipelago'''.  
*Merriam-Webster (1996): the lands of the ''cen'' & S Pacific including Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia (including New Zealand), often Australia, & sometimes the '''Malay Archipelago'''.
*EB (2010): The term, in its widest sense, embraces the entire insular region between Asia and the Americas. [I can find no such usage.] A more common definition excludes the Ryukyu, Kuril, and Aleutian islands and the Japan archipelago. The most popular usage delimits Oceania further by eliminating Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines ... Oceania then, in its most restricted meaning, includes more than 10,000 islands, with a total land area (excluding Australia, but including Papua New Guinea and New Zealand) of approximately 317,700 square miles (822,800 square km).
So the EB excludes Australia as well as the Malay arch. from the land area, but there are reasons (below) to think this is not a RS. 
*Douglas & Ballard (2008) ''Foreign bodies: Oceania and the science of race 1750-1940'': They "recuperate" the term and apply it to Indonesia-Hawaii-Australia-New Zealand-Easter Island, and cover the history of the term. Its coinage as the "Fifth part of the World" included Bornea, Indonesia, Timor, Singapore, Philippines, New Guinea, Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, and specifically excluded Japan, Formosa, Luchus, Aleutians, pace the EB. They note that "By the 1970s ... in French, ''Océanie'' had contracted in conformity with the international geopolitical norm that puts the '''Malay Archipelago''' in Asia and divides Asia from Oceania along the arbitrary colonial border which cuts the island of New Guinea in two." 
We cover both the regional and the geopolitical conceptions noted in Douglas & Ballard, but neither are illustrated by our map: at the least we would need to include Polynesia and exclude Indonesian Papua. I would exclude the EB as an outlier I've been unable to verify even with this very detailed history. (We don't use encyclopedias as sources anyway.) 
*The Diagram Group (2006) ''Environment: An Illustrated Guide to Science'', p 18: "Oceania comprises the islands of the southern, western, and central Pacific Ocean including Australia, New Zealand, and the '''Malay Archipelago'''." 
*Luck (1998) ''The American desk encyclopedia'': It includes the islands of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia and, sometimes, Australasia ... and the '''Malay Archipelago'''.
*Kerr (2003) ''Tourism public policy, and the strategic management of failure'', p 64: "Oceania refers imprecisely to the lands of the Pacific Ocean such as Australia; New Zealand; the '''Malay Archipelago'''; Micronesia; Polynesia; Melanesia; New Guinea; and Papua New guinea" 
*Pendergast & Hermsen (2004) ''Fashion, costume, and culture: clothing, headwear, body decorations, and footwear through the ages,'' v 2, p 333: "To most geographers the lands that make up Oceania include Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia, New Zealand, and often Australia and the '''Malay Archipelago'''." 
*Bulkeley (2008), "Religions of Oceania", in ''Dreaming in the world's religions: a comparative history'', NYU, p 233: The nineteenth-century French term "Oceania" ... is a collective noun denoting the kindred cultures of Australia, New Guinea, the '''Malay Archipelago''', New Zealand, and the hundreds of Pacific islands ...
The broad conception is used in some surprising places, such as,
*Leibs (2004) ''Sports and games of the Renaissance'' p 173: "Oceania refers to the myriad of islands ... in the central and southern Pacific Ocean, ranging roughly from Australia to Hawaii, including the '''Malay Archipelago''', Melanesia, Micronesia, New Zealand, and Polynesia." 
*McEvoy (1988) ''Knife & tomahawk throwing: the art of the experts'', p 139: Oceania, the islands of ... Australasia, Polynesia, and the '''Malay archipelago''', were all peopled with hunters and warriors who used spear-throwers of various types. 
*DP Sen (2005) ''Advances in Fish Processing Technology'', p 631: "In Asia (Japan and China) and Oceania ('''Malay archipelago'''), several species [of seaweed] are eaten raw"
The last was published in India, and so might be expected to have a clear idea as to what "Asia" is. 

It's not even the case that Australia is always included when the Malay arch. is. In Blackwood William and Sons' ''Fifth Geographical Reader, Standard VI'' (can't find a date, but old), "Oceania" is the Malay arch, Melanesia (New Guinea, Fiji, etc. but ''not'' Australia), Micronesia, & Polynesia. The islands are commonly defined to include up to the Bonins in the N. 

Australasia, BTW, is commonly defined to be almost exactly what we have on our map: Australia, Melanesia, & New Zealand, with the only difference being the common inclusion of the Moluccas / Wallacea in Melanesia and Australasia. 
— [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 06:13, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
:Perhaps the article then needs to be expanded, especially the interpretation section, before all the map debate. I think the common interpretation of Australia+Pacific w/o Malay archipelago is due to atlases using Oceania as a 7th continent I reckon. That's personally how I've always seen it. If the sources elaborate on this definition, and why, that'd be useful. For now more acknowledgement and explanation would be useful. 
:In regards to the map, maybe if we shift the current globe northeast, showing the pacific with australasia in the southwest? [[User:Chipmunkdavis|Chipmunkdavis]] ([[User talk:Chipmunkdavis|talk]]) 12:23, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
::Yes, these descriptions all seem to consider Oceania a geographic region rather than a continent; the continent tends to be Australia or Australasia. The geopolitical conception is the most common when fitting this into political boundaries, as in atlases & the UN. Most of our article is about geopolitical Oceania, but the current map is not. We should at least have a map that matches one of the two. — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 15:04, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

Both of the two maps that have been tried are far from ideal. They are centred over mid-Australia, so Hawaii is perched on the edge of the globe, and I'm not sure if Easter Island is even visible. India is given much more prominence. And the maps do not show small islands well (or at all?), which is a big defect for this region. I think a better map would be centred around the intersection of the date line and the equator, or a bit to its west, and would show EEZ outlines as well as coastlines. --[[User:Avenue|Avenue]] ([[User talk:Avenue|talk]]) 18:03, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

::It isn't part of any continent. There seems to be a misconception that every piece of land has to be part of a continent, but this isn't true. There are many island nations that aren't part of a continent. Adding New Zealand to the continent of Australia (or Australasia) is unnecessary. It would make sense to do so if NZ was on the continental shelf of Australia, as New Guinea is, but NZ isn't on the continental shelf. So then you may wonder, what is NZ? Simple. NZ is the dry-land portion of the submerged Microcontinent of Zealandia. Oceania is a geopolitical region, not a true continent, as it doesn't comprise a unified landmass (which is how geologists describe a continent).

Is the map wrong? The article says Australasia is a "part" of Oceania, but I don't think it makes it clear what the difference is. The map of Oceania on this page has only half the island of New Guineau, PNG, but the Australasia page includes all of it. Which is right? 

Seems to me there's a great deal of confusion about what's what. I wonder if there's even any point having two articles about the same thing, since as far as I'm aware Australasia and Oceania are used interchangeably.[[Special:Contributions/5.69.198.16|5.69.198.16]] ([[User talk:5.69.198.16|talk]]) 22:05, 20 September 2013 (UTC)
:In my experience, Australasia has one of two similar meanings: 1) it is used as a shorthand for the countries of Australia and New Zealand acting as a unit, as happened in the past in some sports or 2) it is used as a subregion within Oceania (in its broadest meaning) containing the two previously mentioned countries (and occasionally Papua New Guinea) in contrast to the common subregions Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia.

So I made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oceania&diff=next&oldid=659129089 this edit] today, but I still don't know for sure if I got it right. Why is the dependency list divided into "internal" and "external"? What's the difference?

:The term [[dependent territory|dependency]] refers to a territory which is not considered to be part of state. West Papua and Papua are both [[Provinces of Indonesia]] and therefore integral parts of Indonesia, and therefore should be listed as a state. It is correct that the exact same argument could be made for Hawaii, though I believe there is some debate as to whether it is located in Oceania. The terms internal and external in relation to dependencies is not supported by evidence. My best guess would be that a distinction is being made between territories which are considered entities in their own right (and therefore are external to their possessing state, such as [[American Samoa]]) and entities which are not administered in their own right (and therefore are part of the internal governance of their possessing state, such as [[Palmyra Atoll]]). Of course if this was the intention then some alterations probably need to be made to the list (for example the [[Ashmore and Cartier Islands]] could just be removed).

My understanding is consistent with what you've linked and what you've said. But Hawaii is currently listed as an "internal dependency". That can't be unless you include Papua and West Papua. Indonesia is generally regarded as belonging to the continent of Asia. I have never heard of it being considered part of Oceania (Not to say the two are mutually exclusive). Do we include the U.S. as part of Oceania to be consistent? Then there is the list linked by the dependency lists, [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Oceania#Other territories]]. It lists Papua, West Papua, ''and'' Hawaii. I'm ignoring any other suspect entries for the moment for the sake of simplicity, but clearly the lists do need to be gone through and fixed.

I think it is now fair to mention both Australia and Oceania in the introduction. What do you think?

:Slight problem. Not all of those explicitly say that they are using Oceania as a continent nor do all of them use Oceania exclusively. For example, the Philip's EAEP source has a map on "Australia and Oceania". I would interpret this as the continent of Australia plus the region of non-continental islands called Oceania. The World Atlas uses "Australia/Oceania" which would probably mean the same thing. And I wouldn't really count the UN as an English language source in the same sense as the Encyclopedia Britannica or the NY Times. Do you have sources from native English speakers that explicitly lists Oceania as a continent (As in "the continents are Asia, Africa.... and Oceania)? Because as a native English speaker I most often come across the term Oceania as a grouping of non-continental islands in the Pacific Ocean, with the continental landmass of Australia sometimes included and sometimes listed alongside it. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 17:20, 18 March 2013 (UTC)
:: '''HERE''' - it is right for the world atlas. Other references are less ambiguous but you need the paper versions. Here an image for the Scholastic atlas => [http://www.myspace.com/oceaniacontinent/photos/1838007]. It is written explicitly that it is the smallest continent. For the Philip's EAEP source , p79 (see on google books), you have 'food production and population by continent' and Oceania is mentioned as a continent. The Chambers atlas can also be found here [http://www.myspace.com/oceaniacontinent/photos/1838007#{%22ImageId%22%3A1838381}]: Oceania is compared with the other continents. Harper Collins atlas has divided the world into the different continents and called the last one Oceania, when other atlas called that Australia [http://www.myspace.com/oceaniacontinent/photos/1838007#{%22ImageId%22%3A1838193}]. You can see in the table of contents of Barnes and Nobles atlas that you have one section for each continent, including Oceania [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-times-atlas-of-the-world-london-times/1002439244#]  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Adrien16|Adrien16]] ([[User talk:Adrien16|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adrien16|contribs]]) 19:31, 18 March 2013 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:::But are those books that compare Oceania to the other continents actually using Oceania as a continent and not as a convenient statistical group? I have seen atlases that use Oceania as the section heading, but still put the word Australia on the main land mass using the same font as is used for "Asia", "Europe", etc. This is then listed on the map key as the font used for continental names. The name of the country is printed in a smaller type on these maps so that the word "Australia" appears twice (more if the names of the Australian states are printed on the map as well). Again, for the Times Atlas, are these sections specifically called continents? We have sources already that explicitly list Australia as a continent, you need to show something just as concrete. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 20:34, 18 March 2013 (UTC)
::::Please see my last message above. For those ones, I have been careful when selecting them, because I am aware that sometimes, as you said, Oceania is used in the heading and then Australia is mentioned as the continent (Rand McNally Answer Atlas is a mistake and should not been here). In all those atlases, continents are defined as cultural-political constructs, which is the common usage (Europe includes all islands, same for all other continents). The name of Australia continent when seen as a political construct is Oceania. So it does make sense to compare statistics between continents because a continent IS a region according to that definition and that is why do you find Oceania compared with other continents. If you are picky, you can see online at least the unambiguous Scholastic Atlas and unambiguous Philip's EAEP source p79 (links above) [[User:Adrien16|Adrien16]] ([[User talk:Adrien16|talk]]) 13:02, 19 March 2013 (UTC).
:::::You're still not getting it. Very few of those sources say specifically "Oceania is the name of a continent". That simply isn't a common usage in English. In English it is most common for the continent to be Australia (more or less limited to the same territory as the country). When comparing all countries around the world it is common for English sources to use the REGION Oceania and compare it to the CONTINENTS Europe, Asia, etc. Looking at the sources you listed, virtually all of them use the "Australia and Oceania" (or "Australia/Oceania" construction) or use Oceania as a specifically named REGION (not continent). There are a few that used "Oceania" in a list with "Europe, Asia, etc." You are interpreting those as saying that Oceania is the name of a continent, I am telling you that that is not necessarily a valid assumption. Are these listed items SPECIFICALLY called "Continents"? --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 15:11, 19 March 2013 (UTC)
::::::I understood perfectly and I answered 2 times now: please follow the links and instructions I have provided in the message above that is now beginning by a HERE (you probably go too far in the past) and you will see that Oceania is mentioned as a '''continent''' for those 2 first selected references. For the other sources I provided, it is more ambiguous, because all the continents are compared to Oceania - as you said, it does not mention the world 'continent'. However, perhaps you do not think they are referring to the continent but the region because you would not do that. But I do not think a geographer would compare all the continents together and then choose to compare the continents with Oceania if they do not think Oceania is a continent. It would be comparing apples and bananas, a geographical non-sense and a little rude slap for Australia inhabitants.[[User:Adrien16|Adrien16]] ([[User talk:Adrien16|talk]]) 10:01, 20 March 2013 (UTC)
:::::::Such a comparison is meaningful if they are using the continents not as continents per se but as convenient groupings of countries. Comparing the continent of Australia (with its sole country) to the continent of Africa (with its dozens) makes little sense. Comparing the Oceanian region to an African region (that is basically the same as the African continent) does. As far as your sources go, I was simply trying to put those two with Oceania used as a continent into perspective with the many others that use it differently. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 15:10, 20 March 2013 (UTC)
:::::::: You do not know if they use it differently so you cannot put them in perspective. Many atlases chose to use both names Australia and Oceania when they want to compare the continents and still show the region of Oceania that features more countries.[[User:Adrien16|Adrien16]] ([[User talk:Adrien16|talk]]) 19:06, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

:Your first unambiguous reference links to a page saying that "this photo cannot be viewed because it has either been deleted or marked as private by the user." The second unambiguous reference is to a page that I cannot view as "[I] have either reached a page that cannot be displayed, or have reached [my] viewing limit for this book." The third unambiguous reference brings a "page cannot be found" result. Your first two ambiguous references bring up the same page (image 22 of 34) for me. The image I see is actually an unambiguous usage of Oceania as a continent. Your third ambiguous reference lists Oceania as a section, but it doesn't seem to show anything about whether the book considers Oceania a continent or simply a convenient region. The fourth ambiguous reference gives me a "file not found" page. However, your reference to the headers makes me think that you mean the list at the top of the page "Africa · Asia · Europe · North America · Oceania · South America · World". Again, there is no notation that these are continents. You seem to assume that they are because most of the list includes continental names. Clicking on Oceania brings up a list of countries within Oceania. Clicking on Australia brings up a page stating that "Australia, the world’s sixth largest country, occupies the smallest, flattest and driest continent." This seems to indicate that the source considers Australia a continent and Oceania a convenient shorthand for "the continent of Australia along with numerous Pacific islands". As for your unavailable online sources, I won't be able to say much about them. I did check the "World Atlas" link and it shows a very confused usage. In some places it uses the combined form Australia/Oceania and in others simply Oceania. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 14:10, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
:Quick addition. I just clicked on the footnote for your UN source. That took me to a page concerning "Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions". This is fairly unambiguous usage of Oceania as a continent. There is still a slight possibility that continent is being suggested as a convenient shorthand for macro geographical region without it being seen as an exact synonym, but without a statement from the UN to that effect I see no reason to not accept this as a usage of Oceania as a continent. --[[User:Khajidha|Khajidha]] ([[User talk:Khajidha|talk]]) 14:16, 24 March 2013 (UTC)

::I don't see what the big deal is here. Doesn't Wikipedia have guidelines for statements/facts that are not agreed on by all sources. Isn't the answer, that some sources say it is a continent, some say it is not a continent, some use the word but do not say whether it is a continent or not. - Clearly the chunk of land that contains most of the country of Australia is a continent/continental landmass, what is considered part of this continent and what is not considered part of this continent are not agreed by everyone, and the proper name of the continent is not agreed on by everyone. Whether islands in the middle of the ocean are part of any continent is not agreed on by everyone. It's not hard to grasp. Same as the exact meaning/scope/coverage of the word itself "Oceania" is not agreed on by all sources, much of this is all ready mentioned in the article anyway.
