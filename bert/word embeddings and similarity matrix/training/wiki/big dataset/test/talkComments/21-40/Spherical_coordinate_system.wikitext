== Elements ==

This needs to be fixed, its why is there no info for spherical coordinates like they have for cylindrical, such as dV and dS:

(From cylindrical article) Line and volume elements

In many problems involving cylindrical polar coordinates, it is useful to know the line and volume elements; these are used in integration to solve problems involving paths and volumes.

The line element is dl = dr\,\mathbf{\hat r} + r\,d\theta\,\boldsymbol{\hat\theta} + dz\,\mathbf{\hat z}.

The volume element is dV = r\,dr\,d\theta\,dz.

The gradient is \nabla = \mathbf{\hat r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + \boldsymbol{\hat \theta}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + \mathbf{\hat z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}.

Even mathworld has dS......

== American convention ==

This article itself states that the international recommended standard for spherical polars is ''r'', ''ϑ'', ''φ'' for distance, zenith, and azimuth. If this is so, why use the american convention for the rest of the article? Shouldn't we use the international convention on the basis of the international applicability of the article?

In the diagram, the "r" length isn't the "r" mentioned in the text right?  It's confusing that it was labelled r.
:Perhaps there should be different diagrams for the different coordinate systems. Unfortunately, someone has to draw them. [[User:Gerbrant|Shinobu]] 10:15, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

The symbols in the text and in the figure don't match. for instance: the azimuth angle in the text is referred to as θ, but the same symbol is taken for the polar angle in the diagramm. The polar angle in the text is a small phi (φ) and a capital phi (Φ) is taken for the azimuth angle in the figure. That is very confusing. ([[User:RolandRo|RolandRo]] 12:37, 11 January 2007 (UTC))

:I have about the same problem, but all phi:s in the text are small (lowercase). I think it's the weird TeX small phi, that looks very much like a capital phi. It's a matter of different fonts. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] 18:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

I do not understand the statement that the so-called American notation makes things more compatible with polar or cylindrical coordinates. On the contrary: using the notation in the article (with ranges indicated for <math>\phi,\theta</math>), cylindrical coordinates would be of the form <math>(\rho,z,\theta)</math>. Whereas starting with the notation <math>(r,\theta)</math> (or <math>(\rho,\theta)</math>) for polar coordinates, cylindrical and spherical coordinates are obtained by simply making the coordinate pair a coordinate triple (with the caveat that <math>\rho</math> would be <math>\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math> rather than <math>\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}</math> with both cylindrical or polar, i.e., the projection onto the <math>xy</math>-plane).

It seems to me that the debate is more between how physicists and mathematicians use different notations, rather than between an American notation and a notation elsewhere. Looking at three calculus textbooks written by reputable American authors, all use the (length,azimuth,zenith) notation. Since I also read French, I took a look at the literature, and there the issue is the same: mathematicians tend to write (length,azimuth,zenith), physicists tend to write (length,zenith,azimuth). The idea is that, making a broad generalizing statement, in mathematics we do not really work with spherical coordinates, they are merely a tool, just another change of basis. Whereas in physics, they are commonly used as a coordinate system proper, in which case it is important that such things as the right hand rule applies, because it makes computations easier to manage.
[[User:Jarino1|Jarino1]] 18:44, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:The difference isn't in the placement of the coordinates; it's which letters are used for which coordinates. In mathematics θ is used for the azimuthal angle and φ is used for the zenith angle. Whereas in physics θ is used for the zenith angle and φ is used for the azimuthal angle. This should be made clear on the article.

:I myself have studied under the mathematical convention in the United States and it is always denoted (ρ, θ, φ); so I disagree with the placement of the coordinates on the article; but this is a separate issue.

:The mathematical convention is more compatible with polar and cylindrical coordinates because on the xy-plane, the azimuthal angle (which is denoted by θ) is the same as the polar angle used in polar and cylindrical coordinates (which is also denoted by θ). --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 21:32, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

::I really like the ISO 31-11 notation, but for it to be compatible with polar coordinates it would be a great idea to start using φ for the polar angle.

:: I'm an unlucky physicist who started in math, so the ISO 31-11 notation always confuses me.

:::If it were a mater of 99 to 1, the most common notation should definitely be used.  However, from these responses and a few check to sources, it seems to me that both variants are fairly common.  Trying to decide which is more common would be both hopeless and pointless.   Thus I would say that either choice is equally good (or equally bad, take your pick), as long as the existence of variant notations is clearly noted, and the same notation is consistently used for the whole article. (On the other hand, due to the way that Wikipedia works, consistency of notation between separate articles so unlikely to be achieved that it is not even worth trying.)  Readers who are used to the other notation will be inconvenienced, but that will happen either way.

:I think there is no real conflict between the choice of &phi; for the azimuth and the polar planar coordinates. When you go from 2D to 3D through a revolution (for instance, when moving from [[elliptic coordinates]] to [[prolate spheroidal coordinates]]; or from [[Bipolar coordinates]] to [[Bispherical coordinates]]) you simply rotate around an axis and call the new coordinate &phi;. In the same way, spherical coordinates are a rotation of polar planar coordinates around the Z axis. &theta; is the same in both systems and the azimuth &phi; is the new coordinate.--[[User:Gonfer|Gonfer]] ([[User talk:Gonfer|talk]]) 19:56, 12 February 2010 (UTC)
::The 'conflict' is that the angular coordinate of polar coordinates (which ranges over a full circle) seems to be commonly denoted by &theta;. Cylindrical coordinates are essentially polar + height, and its only angular coordinate is the azimuth.  In spherical coordinates there are two angular coordinates, but only one of them ranges over a full 360° circle, namely the azimuth. So consistency would dictate using the same symbol for these three coordinates, and a distinct symbol &phi; for elevation (which ranges from -90° to +90°) or inclination (which ranges from 0 to 180°). Alas, the world is not consistent, and it is not Wikipedia's role to make it so. All the best, --[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] ([[User talk:Jorge Stolfi|talk]]) 20:45, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

== Longitude ==

I don't think this statement is correct:

The longitude is the azimuth angle shifted 180° from θ to give a domain of -180° ≤ θ ≤ 180°.

Assuming the x axis goes from the center of the Earth through the equator at 0 deg longitude, then I believe the correct wording is:

The longitude is the azimuth angle but for 180° < θ < 360°,  subtract 360° so that -180° < longitude ≤ 180°. 

Actually, it would probably be more correct to bring up East and West when talking about longitude, but in any case, saying a shift by 180 deg is wrong (unless the x axis is supposed to point through the 180 deg longitude point which I doubt) [[User:DaraParsavand|DaraParsavand]] 19:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

: You're right, it's only a shift on half the values. I think it's pointless to discern whether any shift starts at θ = 0° or θ = 90° or anywhere else, so I've left it as an east-west distinction. –[[User talk:Pomte|Pomte]] 11:37, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

Conventional spherical coordinates as described in this article are a combination of rotations along the z and y axes. However, [[Euler angles]] are most commonly combinations of z and y rotations.

::::* I agree that using theta for both elevation and inclination is confusing, but that unfortunately seems to be the situation in the real world. The use of lambda for elevation seems common in geography, but geographic coordinates (lat/lon/alt) are not quite spherical coordinates, due to the way latitude and altitude are defined (reference spheroid and all that).  Outside geography, theta and phi seems to be used for [inclination or elevation] and [azimuth] — and not even "respectively"!  The article tries to be consistent (if it is not, it should be fixed) and to give formulas for both conventions when possible; but even so it is necessary to say every time what theta is, for the benefit of readers who are used to the other convention.
:::::*I think for purposes of this article, we can ignore that the earth is only a spheroid. A spherical coordinate system can be readily projected onto a spheroid. Latitude and longitude together with altitude are indeed a complete spherical coordinate system, and as they are the only one most people are familiar with it behooves any wikipedia author working on this article to treat it with respect and expertise.

== Linear algebra, analytic geometry, or geometry? ==
===Unit Vectors, Position Vectors, Frame of Reference, Orthonormal Basis===
The above words should be incorporated in the definitions of any coordinate system. There is a reference zenith direction which is more accurately represented by a "[[unit vector]]," and it should be called exactly that, and may be impartially named <math>\hat z</math> for succinctness in references to it. There is a reference azimuth direction, also, more precisely a unit vector, which may be called <math>\hat x</math>, again, for the purposes of succinctness in the descriptions of the various conventions used. We need to adopt a convention in order to describe other conventions in precise mathematical terms. These two constitute an [[orthonormal basis]], a [[frame of reference]], relative to which the coordinates of a point, represented by a [[position vector]] ''OP'' may be defined. "Spherical coordinates" is a mathematical phrase, more than geographical or astronomical, and it should therefore be treated in precise terms. Three-dimensional coordinate systems have their roots in the Cartesian system, which universally uses <math>\hat x</math>, <math>\hat y</math>, & <math>\hat z</math>  as its unit vectors, and which are just as universally mapped to the spherical coordinate system as I suggested.
*"Mathematical precision" does not mean "mathematical formalism".  The latter may be more coincise, but I am not sure that it is more understandable or even more precise.<br/>You and I are used to 'algebraic prose' like "let ''x'' be a direction on the plane ''P'' orthogonal to ''z''"; and, for instance, we understand that this sentence is defining not only ''x'' but also ''P''.  Well, I do not think we can assume that much from readers who come to this article to know what "spherical coordinates" are.  I suspect that a 'plain English' definition, like the current one in the article, will actually be easier for them to understand (and no less precise) than an 'algebraic prose' definition.<br/> The term "direction", in particular, is mathematically precise (in this context, it has is no possible interpretation other than the one intended).  It is no less precise than "plane" and "point".  Ditto for the other terms.  A "unit vector" is a vector with unit length; but that length is not needed anywhere in the definition of spherical coordinates, so using a unit vector to define a direction (outside of linear algebra) is a mathematical overkill. (My favorite way of defining "direction" is a point at infinity in [[oriented projective geometry|oriented projective space]]; but I will not use that here, either 8-). <br/>Moreover, the concept of "vector" is actually much harder to define than a spherical coordinate system.<br/> If we were defining spherical coordinates *relative to a previously defined Cartesian coordinate system*,  it would be natural to use the unit vectors '''x''', '''y''', and '''z'''; but it is not the case here.  The reasonable foundation for the article is Euclidean geometry.  We cannot assume (or pretend, or postulate) that Cartesian coordinates are more fundamental than spherical ones.<br/>Furthermore, two orthogonal vectors do not define a Cartesian system in Euclidean 3-space, because the direction of the third vector cannot be defined mathematically; it must be chosen explicitly. (In Euclidean geometry there is no absolute handedness.) In spherical coordinate system, the third vector (''y'') does not appear anywhere except to define the positive sense of turning on the reference plane. So, again, if one is defining spherical coords directly, rather than though a prior Cartesian system, it is cleaner and simpler to choose the sense of positive rotation directly.

::The term "direction" is no less imprecise than "vector", it's just the fact that you don't use the former so much when you're actually establishing the foundations of 3-D geometry. I have attempted to introduce the concept of a vector through illustration, for now, making do with the less-than-ideal graphics that are there.<br/> My reason for the introduction and use of (a) unit vectors <math>\hat z</math> & <math>\hat x</math> to represent the reference directions and (b) the position vector ''OP'', ''from the outset'', has to do with the fact that Cartesian, spherical, or any other system's coordinates may later be more conveniently derived from, and defined by, just these two orthonormal (basis) vectors and the position vector:<br/>
::<math>\hat y = \hat z \times \hat x</math><br/>

::All it takes is the definition of [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] to put things in the above, unambiguous, symbolic form: it is immeasurably harder to solve problems in 3-D geometry without these well-established concepts. The use of these two basis vectors is essential regardless of what orthogonal coordinate system you're deriving. Our only connection to the Cartesian system is the reuse of two of its coordinate ''names''. The reason why we cannot use <math>\hat r,\,\hat\theta,\,\hat\phi</math> as basis vectors is that they are position-dependent and not fixed in space; they are only used to describe the orientation of a vector in a vector field.<br/> Also, as I've shown above, two orthogonal vectors ''do'' define the Cartesian (or any other) system, as the third vector is derived from the first two.

***You are assuming that one can or should define spherical coordinates ''only'' after defining Cartesian coordinates, dot product, cross product etc.  This approach is a big overkill, and not appropriate for an encyclopedia! It may be adequate for a textbook on calculus or a university math curriculum, where students are assumed to learn one before going on to the other. But that is not a reasonable assumption for Wikipedia readers.<br/> In any case, Cartesian coodinates and algebra (much less linear agebra!) are absolutely NOT necessary to define spherical coordinates, and do NOT make them easier to understand.  In geography, for instance, people have always used and defined spherical coordinates directly, without even mentioning Cartesian ones.  Linear algebra (vectors, dot product, cross product, etc.) are definitely NOT "the foundation of 3D geometry", only of ''analytical'' geometry. People have been and are doing some pretty advanced 3D geometry, including speherical coordinates, without reference to any of those concepts.<br>Finally, the cross product formula can be used ONLY after you have chosen all THREE Cartesian basis vectors, so you cannot use it to define the third vector in terms of the other two.  Either you choose the third vector explicitly, or you choose a handedness for 3-space (which is not "built in" in Eucliean geometry).  You cannot escape that.<br/>So please keep the original simple, direct, algebra-free, non-circular definition; there was nothing wrong with it.  Please.

===Dot product, cross product, handedness; abstract and concrete===
:Two comments you made still bother me:
#You insist that one "cannot use [the concept of cross product] to define the third vector in terms of the other two." Do we at least agree that any 3-D frame of reference can be represented (i.e. fixed in space) by exactly two basis vectors? Does the concept of "right angle" assume knowledge of the Cartesian coordinate system? The third basis vector in establishing such a system is simply defined as being simultaneously at right angles to the first two, with a particular handedness: you fix the system in space by only fixing two of these basis vectors; the last one follows in a predetermined way.
#*Yes, *once you choose a "right" handedness for the space*, then two orthogonal directions define a third direction orhtogonal to both, unambigously, by that "right hand" rule.<br/>  But classical Euclidean 3D geometry usually does not distingish "right handed" from "left handed".  I presume that this "hand neutrality" is a consequence of Euc.Geom. having been developed first for the plane, in contexts where the handedness is irrelevant.  Consider for example the theorem or axiom "two triangles are equal if corresponding sides are equal": it implicitly assumes that you can flip one triangle over to match it with the other triangle.  For *physical* 3D space (the one whe move in) we of course cannot "flip" a solid over, so one may assume that "right-handed" is well defined and use that to define the third axis. (But you should read Martin Gardner's discussion in ''The Ambidextrous Universe''. And if the physical universe turns out to have the topology of a non-orientable 3D manifold, then we are in trouble again...) However, if we are choosing coordinates for some abstract 3D space (such as the state of a compressed gas), then there is no natural definition of "right-handed", and one must specify the three axes explicitly.  I suppose that there are people who define and work with "oriented Euclidean 3D space" (classical E. space plus a distinguished handedness), but that does not seem to be common. 
#:*PS. I forgot to say: yes, in Euclidean geometry the concept of "perpendicular" is defined (and almost primitive). In the plane, two lines are perpendicular if all four angles between them are congruent (and "congruent" is a primitive concept).  "Parallel" is a more primitive notion: two lines are parallel if they lie on the same plane but never meet. The existence of parallel lines is an axiom (much disputed until Lobachevski/Riemman).
#** Thanks!<br/>I guess I was confusing the definition of "frame of reference" with the definition of a "coordinate system," which requires further elaboration, such as the definition of the third basis vector (in Cartesian coordinates) even though it is based on the first two; the function that defines the third basis is what adds that third dimension. In Spherical coordinates, there are three functions of the same basis vectors defining three alternate dimensions (not basis vectors, nevertheless having the ability to uniqely define a point in space, except at the degeneracies.[[User:Toolnut|Toolnut]] ([[User talk:Toolnut|talk]]) 21:48, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

#*In geometry, a rotation is defined as a mapping of points to points that preserves all distances between point pairs and has only one line's worth of fixed points. So there are no equations to derive. (The last condition is only needed to exclude reflections and screw motions; the first condition alone defines the class of congruences or isometries, which are much more important in geometry.) Given enough data to determine the rotation (for example, the fixed axis line and two directions perpendicular to it) there is a simple 3D geometric construction that will yield the rotated image of any given point.  Again without any formulas.<br/> What you ask is a problem of ''analytic'' geometry.  All the best, --[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] ([[User talk:Jorge Stolfi|talk]]) 19:36, 9 December 2009 (UTC)
#**Right, I was talking about 3D rotation about an arbitrary axis and the derivation of the new coordinates of an arbitrary point (''x'', ''y'', ''z''), or (''r'', ''&theta;'', ''&phi;''), from knowledge of the direction numbers of the axis of rotation (represented by a unit vector). Is "analytic geometry" really what I'm after, not so much "linear algebra"? I'm not aware that linear algebra deals with cross products and their physical meaning, or the physical meaning of dot products, either, especially because it is more general than just 3D space. Cross products don't carry over to higher dimensions very well, even without a physical meaning. (My last attempt to do that implied that a cross product becomes a trinary operation in 4D, an operation on three 4D vectors.) Anyway, there is no easier way to do this task (derive the coords of a rotated point) than through the use of vectors and their dot and cross products, is there?[[User:Toolnut|Toolnut]] ([[User talk:Toolnut|talk]]) 21:48, 9 December 2009 (UTC)
#***Cross products can be generalized to any dimension ''n'' and any number ''m''≤''n'' of vectors as follows: assemble an ''m'' by ''n'' matrix ''M'' where each row is one of the vectors, in the order given.  Then take the ''m'' by ''m'' minors, that is, the determinants of all ''m'' by ''m'' submatrices (formed by choosing ''m'' out of the ''n'' columns) of ''M'', each multiplied by (&minus;1)<sup>''p''</sup> where ''p'' is the "parity" of the corresponding column subset. List these minors in some canonical order, to get a vector with ''choose''(''n'',''m'') coordinates.  These numbers identify the linear subspace spanned by the given vectors --- uniquely, except by a common scale factor.  In projective geometry these are called the Grassman or Plücker coordinates of that subspace; I don't know what they are called in linear algebra.<br/>The parity ''p'' is the number of column swaps that one must perform to bring the chosen columns to columns 1..''m'', without changing their relative order or that of the remaining columns.<br/>In particular, if ''m'' = 2 and ''n'' = 3, and one lists the determinants in the order {2,3}, {1,3}, {1,2}, one gets the standard 3D cross product; the respective parities are 2, 1, 0.<br/>If ''m''=1 and ''n''=2, one gets the formula for rotating a 2D vector by 90 degrees.</br>If ''m''=''n''&minus;1, as you noted, one gets another ''n''-vector that is orthogonal to the given ones.  If ''m''=''n'' one gets a single number, the determinant of ''M''; which is the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the given vectors, with a sign that depends on their ''n''-dimensional handedness (in the given order).<br/>All the best,  --[[User:Jorge Stolfi|Jorge Stolfi]] ([[User talk:Jorge Stolfi|talk]]) 22:17, 9 December 2009 (UTC)
#***As for your other questions: in linear algebra 'vectors' are either abstract objects defined indirectly by their properties (the usual mathematicians' view), or lists of real numbers (a more pdestrian, let's say "engineers'" view). Analytic geometry ties algebra and linear algebra to geometry, usually by choosing a Cartesian coordinate system, mapping points to Cartesian triplets, and then using algebra and engineers' linear algebra on those.  However one can also define a vector in geometric terms (as an Euclidean "translation", for example) and use abstract linear algebra on them, without ever choosing a coordinate system.  Of course, if you want coordinates out, you need  coordinates in.  In abstract liner algebra one can define an abstract dot product too, as being a binary operation with certain properties.  Once you have a dot product you can define "distance" and "perpendicular", and then you can do with abstract vectors anything that you can do in Euclidean geometry, for any dimension ''n'' --- all abstractly. (But you don't get handedness yet; for that you need an ''n''-ary "mixed product" operation, the ''n'' by ''n'' signed volume determinant, in the engineers' view.) You can define what a "rotation" is in abstract linear algebra, and "compute" its effect from given data (as in the Euclidean rotation example above), all without coordinates; but again, if you want coordinates out, you need coordinates in.

== Inclination or elevation, which should come first ==

I have reworded the lead to define the 'inclination' variant first, then 'elevation'.  The rest of the article uses mostly the inclination variant, and that seems to be the preference of some editors (however the 'elevation' fans may have been a silent majority). On the other hand, the 'inclination' variant is a bit more awkward to define, since one needs to introduce both the zenith and the reference plane; whereas to define the 'elevation' variant one needs only the reference plane.

:I think the inclination variant is pretty unnatural for the reason you stated (it requires a zenith not otherwise needed). I have only encountered elevation variants (I think). Both the world coordinate system and the celestial coordinate system are elevational, and because of their importance and familiarity I would recommend that they should come first in an article that attempts to be generally applicable like this one does. By the way, the celestial coordinate system uses the term declination, not elevation, and not inclination. [[User:Dlw20070716|Dlw20070716]] ([[User talk:Dlw20070716|talk]]) 07:58, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

== Figure order ==

The fisrt three figures were recently reordered. I have partially restored their original order. The two line diagrams should come first since they illustrate the two variants of spherical coordinates (inclination vs. elevation) defined in the first paragraph.  The raytraced figure is somewhat redundant, it does not show the coordinates proper (only their isosurfaces for one point), and requires a much longer caption to make sense. 

On the other hand, I have retained the new order between the two line diagrams (with inclination before elevation), since I have also reordered the definitions of the two variants in the lead paragraph (see above). Note that swapping the two figures requires rewriting their captions.

e.g. converting (1,0,0) returns θ =π/2 and φ =π/2  , according to dimension it ought to be θ = 0. The inconsistency can well be in [[dimension]]s,  θ and φ  might adhere to a different convention with respect to their relation to x,y,y than this article.

== There's actually 2 spherical coordinate systems ==

And I'm not just talking about which symbol (phi or theta) is used for which angle. For the purpose of this post, theta will be the vertical angle (the one off of the XY plane) and phi will be the horizontal angle (the one in the XY plane).

The version of spherical coordinates talked about here in Wikipedia works like this:

Theta is the angle from the z axis, and goes from 0 to pi

Phi is the angle from the x axis in the XY plane and can go from either 0 to 2pi or -pi to pi

Rho is the distance from the origin

The transformation to Cartesian coordinates, which is specified in the wiki article, is as follows.

x = rho * sin(theta) * cos(phi)

y = rho * sin(theta) * sin(phi)

z = rho * cos(theta)



However, there's a variant of the spherical coordinate system, which can actually be more practical in some applications (namely, when you don't want your vertical angle theta to be 0 on the z axis, but rather have theta be 0 on the XY plane). In this case, the definitions of the variables are as follows. 

Theta is the angle from the XY plane, and goes from -pi/2 to pi/2

Phi is the angle from the x axis in the XY plane and can go from either 0 to 2pi or -pi to pi

Rho is the distance from the origin

The transformation to Cartesian coordinates is as follows.

x = rho * cos(theta) * cos(phi)

y = rho * cos(theta) * sin(phi)

z = rho * sin(theta)

Notice that where you previously had cos(theta) you now have sin(theta), and where you previously had sin(theta) you now have cos(theta).
