==Feedback==

This page has been very helpful and I learned a lot.  Thanks.

I made one change, by deleting the text "In 1983, the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was given to [[Barbara McClintock]] for her work with the complex color patterns and genetics of Indian corn."  This is because "Indian corn" refers to Mexico and nearby areas, rather than South Asia.

:Great start Jay! Of course, a lot of stuff can be added. Statistics regarding agricultural production over the last century, more historical details including zamindari system, land reforms etc, maps showing what is produced where and when (details of Rabi and Kharif crops), more details of problems facing the Indian agriculture, changing patterns (
c), practices involved in agriculture (like 'jhoom' cultivation in the Northeast), to mention some. [[User:deeptrivia|deeptrivia]] ([[User talk:deeptrivia|talk]]) 03:06, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

Yes, very good start. But there is a huge historical jump from prehistory to post independence. I am working on "Tractors in India" and am searching for history of tractors in India pre and post Independence and would appreciate any suggestions on where to find this. As for this website there are known historic writings on the precursors to ICAR the setting up the royal institute for ag sciences in Pusa, Bihar now Rajendra Agricultural University. I will try to share some these soon.. [[User:SEJustice|SEJustice]] 08:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

Is India providing proper interest fr the loans being given to the farmers with the motive of uplifting the farmers and for the development of the nation's economy as being said Agriculture is the backbone of India...

== Comments ==

Some comments:
* Image stack should be removed. Instead, thumbnails of pertinent images to the section be added.
* Coloured of tobacco etc boxes be removed.
* The article reads more like a historical account of Indian agriculture. Instead, it should be written less of historical accounts and more on cash/food crops, rabi/kharif crops, plus statistics to support all.

:I can see how the colored boxes may prove to be a distraction. I'd like to keep the Image stack as it accommodates maximum number of images in one article (it does interfere with some browsers but the main 'edit' button at the top still works). A thumbnail view might not be able to do the same. As for the format, the article did deal with the present, but without sources (it can be expanded using a table and a good source for gross output though). The 'contemporary' section on Indian agriculture still has more info than I found in the Encyclopedia Britannica and the ''[[Encyclopedia of India]]'' sections, though like here on Wikipedia, bits of info was scattered throughout many articles outside of the main sections in those books.

The information provided in this article is very specific and the majority of the references are reliable. While specificity is not a problem, the length of the sections could be edited. Especially under the Indian Agriculture Policy and the History. History plays a major role in the current agriculture in India and should be looked into more deeply.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Marcucmr|Marcucmr]] ([[User talk:Marcucmr|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Marcucmr|contribs]]) 22:05, 25 September 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Importance of women in agriculture==
In the discussion of agriculture in India, it is necessary to recognize the importance of women farmers and agricultural laborers. According to 2011 statistics, women comprise about 33% of cultivators and about 47% percent of agricultural laborers <E. Krishna Rao></E. Krishna Rao>. Although men still make up most of the labor force, the share of women in the sector is growing rapidly, as the appeal of a commodity economy encourages migration of men to urban areas to work as rickshaw drivers, or take jobs in manufacturing, textiles and the like. As men leave, the responsibilities of family care, sustenance and often times, income production, fall on women. About 70% of Indian women depend on agricultural work for their livelihood, according to 2010 statistics. Among more rural populations it is as high as 84% <C. Tara Satyavathi, Ch. Bharadwaj and P.S. Brahmanand></C. Tara Satyavathi, Ch. Bharadwaj and P.S. Brahmanand>. The disproportionately high number of women who depend on agriculture activity reveals a large and very vulnerable population that must be discussed. I believe that the article "Agriculture in India" could be edited to include more information on women in the country's agricultural sector. However, considering the body of information, I think it better to create a separate article. A new article will include a historical perspective, Boserup's study of women in agriculture, the feminization of agriculture, and forms of access to land. I will study the extraneous factors such as the limitations of agricultural growth, global climate change challenges, and impacts of the India-EU Free Trade Agreement on women. It will conclude with  examples and methodologies of the collective action that are fighting for female empowerment in India's agricultural sector. I would like to learn more about whether women are concentrated in production of certain agricultural goods. What are the standards of work for both men and women in the sector? What types of grassroots institutions exist on the ground for support to rural people engaged in farming? I would greatly appreciate any recommendations for resources or any advice in creating this article. Thanks!

== Misprint on map image? ==

[[:File:Major_crop_areas_India.png]] has a key that shows colours and letters for each crop (which I assumed was doubled up for good accessibility and printing reasons), but the colours don't seem to correspond to the letters at all - there are brown regions marked "R" and "J", yellow regions marked "B" and "R", etc. Am I misunderstanding the map, or should the key be corrected? --[[User:McGeddon|McGeddon]] ([[User talk:McGeddon|talk]]) 09:42, 19 July 2013 (UTC)

== Proposed merge with Farming systems in India ==

While the originally intended focus was on [[Sustainable agriculture]], current content of [[Farming systems in India]] isn't focussed at all, rather constituting a hodge-podge of various aspects of farming in India. We may either merge that article into [[Agriculture in India]], or develop it into a more clearly focused article on [[Sustainable agriculture in India]], or do a combination of the two.
