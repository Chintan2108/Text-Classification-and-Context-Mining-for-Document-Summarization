== Involvement in politics controversies section ==
This section appears to be clearly contrary to [[WP:CRITS]] - and more specifically, [[WP:CORG]]. The article no doubt needs to be broadly rewritten to remove the 'controversies' section per [[WP:CRITS]]. This particular section appears to focus on two articles written by [[The Australian]] journalists [[Janet Albrechtsen]] (and one by [[Miranda Devine]]). I have particular concern re:

"If reliable sources – ''other than the critics themselves'' – provide substantial coverage devoted to the controversies or criticisms, then that may justify sections and sub-articles devoted to the controversies or criticism – however within the limitations of WP:BLPGROUPS."

The controversy is merely the op-ed pieces published in this one newspaper. I don't see any substantial secondary coverage of the criticisms. I do not believe this is relevant to the article as a whole. The language used appears to also breach [[WP:BIAS]], e.g. describing events using the language of the columnists - 'suffering post-presidential election trauma' (which does not appear to be present in the source material). Wikipedia is not a place to collect any organisation/individual ([[WP:NOT]]) that is criticised by in op-ed pieces. It seems to be portraying a POV. Have reverted to the status quo, pending a consensus for inclusion. <strong><font style="color: #082567">[[User:Mvjs|Mvjs]]</font><font style="color: #000000">[[User talk:Mvjs|Talking]]</font></strong> 15:42, 30 November 2016 (UTC)

== Software security hole issue. ==

Not sure if this can be added directly to the article due to the above issue, but I figured that it could be mentioned here and added later, if deemed important.  Basically, there are a few news reports on PwC being involved with attempting to prevent discussion and disclosure of a security issue in one of their products.  Articles: [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/09/fatal_flaw_in_pricewaterhousecoopers_sap_software/  Fatal flaw found in PricewaterhouseCoopers SAP security software], [https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/flaw-pricewaterhousecoopers-software-can-allow-hackers-manipulate-accounting-results-report-1595830  Flaw in PricewaterhouseCoopers software can allow hackers to manipulate accounting results – report].  Additionally, here is the details of the group that reported it, if it can be used: [http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Dec/33 (ESNC-2041217) Critical Security Vulnerability in PwC ACE Software for SAP Security].  --[[User:Super Goku V|Super Goku V]] ([[User talk:Super Goku V|talk]]) 05:01, 11 December 2016 (UTC)

== Infos about 2016 ==

Who can say befor the end of 2016, which are the data of income of 2016? Somebody has already written a definitiv nummre: US$35.9 billion (2016. Thats just stupid and exrem unserious! --[[Special:Contributions/77.56.118.154|77.56.118.154]] ([[User talk:77.56.118.154|talk]]) 14:42, 22 December 2016 (UTC)

:the figure is for the year ending 30 June (as stated in the citation). By the way please read [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks]]. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 20:56, 22 December 2016 (UTC)

== Controversies and Undue Weight ==

I have looked at a few of the other wiki articles about large accounting firms, and see that several of them do not have separate sub-headings for each topic under controversies, but rather, just bullet-point or just indent each topic. I propose doing the same here. Having each subject a separate sub-heading gives [[Neutral point of view|undue weight]] to the controversies in the table of contents. The article would look much more balanced with bullets rather than sub-heads. Take a look here: [[KPMG]]; [[Deloitte]]; [[Grant Thornton]]; [[Cork Gully]]. I was surprised to see that the other large firms in this category have anemic Wiki articles. When I am satisfied that PwC is the best it can be, the other accounting firms are on my to-do list, for sure. Check out: [[Baker Tilly International]]; [[Smith & Williamson]]; and [[RSM Tenon]]. I am especially looking for {{reply to|Dormskirk}}'s thoughts about this.  [[User:Icanseearainbow|Icanseearainbow]] ([[User talk:Icanseearainbow|talk]]) 08:52, 11 May 2017 (UTC)

: I agree - good suggestion. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 20:57, 11 May 2017 (UTC)

It's going to be difficult to navigate around the PwC article if the controversies are not separately referenced in the index at the top.  At the moment there's 21 controversies and they do rather stand on their own.  

On the other hand the stuff added recently under the headings Sponsorship, Corporate Affairs & Culture and Data Analysis strike me as having undue weight and they don't exactly seem to be neutral in tone.

[[User:Swinnow16|Swinnow16]] ([[User talk:Swinnow16|talk]]) 19:06, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

:Hi - I would also support deletion of the whole sponsorship section which just looks like advertising to me. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 19:21, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

Thanks for the feedback. I think it would be ideal if there was more consistency between all the Wikipedia articles of the Big Four firms, (as well as the smaller professional services firms, as I have stated above). I welcome the sponsorship section here on the PwC Wiki, since all the other three have such a section. Also, it is pretty standard for large companies to have discussions in their wikis about Corporate Affairs. PwC is highly involved in the analysis of economic trends and many other important issues, which is significant indicator of exactly the types of things this company is involved in, and why it is such a large and well-respected company. However, perhaps it would be a good idea to bullet-point the sponsorhip and Corporate affairs sections as well as the controversy section, if you think there is undue weight otherwise. Keep the feedback coming! [[User:Icanseearainbow|Icanseearainbow]] ([[User talk:Icanseearainbow|talk]]) 07:46, 14 May 2017 (UTC)
:The controversies, affairs and culture items that are described in only one or two sentence could be combined into bullet-point lists. The larger sections should keep their subheadings for ease of navigation.--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 21:35, 16 May 2017 (UTC)

== Recent additions to the article ==

Since May 3 there have been {{Diff|title|780656928|778426406|large additions to the article}}. Much of it does not warrant inclusion. What are your thoughts on what is worth keeping?--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 23:05, 16 May 2017 (UTC)

:Yes there certainly have been a lot of edits to the page recently. But the question is if the page is improved by the edits. It makes sense that some people who came to the page in the aftermath of the Academy Awards came back to add sorely missing information about the company. I for one welcome all the new information added, which to my mind brings the article in line with the size and the importance of the company. Instead of focusing on the size of the article, or how quickly it grew recently, we should be examining the look and feel of the article to make sure it is a neutral and comprehensive well of facts for the curious and interested.

== Potential vandalism by anonymous user 216.31.12.4  ==

Worth noting that it appears someone is trying to wipe a sub section of the controversies section related to Australia. Annon user complete visual edits to wipe the section clean. Motivation at this stage is unclear.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:PaulMason1990|PaulMason1990]] ([[User talk:PaulMason1990#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/PaulMason1990|contribs]]) 22:48, 14 August 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Hi,{{reply to|PaulMason1990}} I think that it is interesting that you would make two serious accusations based on very little evidence. Removal of the "Australia" section is not vandalism just because you disagree with the edit. The section was poorly written, mentioned several different events in a jumbled, unclear way; mentioned completely irrelevant "controversies" that have nothing to do with the company, or are not even controversies, and are sloppy grammatically speaking. It seems that you and {{reply to|Burtgumpford}} are more likely either [[Single-purpose account|SPA]]'s, meat puppets or sock puppets, considering the fact that both of these users have no other edits and are solely dedicated to reporting negative information about PwC. Please examine your addition to the page carefully and only include issues that pertain to the company, and not individuals, and only things that are relevant as controversies. We can discuss the issues here and stop making accusations. I am going to make a few changes to that section right now. I will leave the rest to you, but if you do not make appropriate changes, I will do it myself, or completely remove the section as I did yesterday. Thanks for your understanding.

== Australia section ==
This section, added by [[User:Burtgumpford]] which has no edits but this lengthy addition to the article, appears to breach [[WP:CRITS]]. I've noted this concern above, and the section appears to merely be a list of articles from ''critics'' rather than secondary, reliable sources. The section seems to be grouped into two categories. Firstly, commentary surrounding the firm from outlets, e.g.
* [[Menzies Research Centre]] - a partisan think tank
* [[The Australian]] columnist [[Janet Albrechtsen]]

I have concerns re [[WP:CRITS]], and in particular:

"If reliable sources – ''other than the critics themselves'' – provide substantial coverage devoted to the controversies or criticisms, then that may justify sections and sub-articles devoted to the controversies or criticism – however within the limitations of WP:BLPGROUPS."

The second category of information is the addition of content from 2012 and 2015 in relation to [[Centro]] and a case concerning bullying. This part appears to be a section falling within the meaning of [[WP:IINFO]], in the sense that it is an indiscriminate list of seemingly unrelated events. I struggle to establish relevance per [[WP:RELEVANCE]]. In the context of a large company like PwC, the history of one market, and seemingly dedicated to editorialising one CEO, would breach [[WP:BALASPS]]. It appears an undue amount of focus would be devoted to these events. The focus on this, in the context of proportionality for a firm this size, would appear to only be consistent with the presentation of a POV.

The section, even with the recent changes, may also breach [[WP:BIAS]]. The original text, albeit amended now, included phrases such as 'This case was not the end of the firm's legal woes under Sayers' and 'Under Sayers' watchful eye'. This is something which appears to, even without the above phrases, advance a particular POV. I don't see any substantial secondary coverage of the criticisms to fall within the meaning of the exception laid out in the [[WP:CRITS]] policy above.

As noted above, this article needs to be broadly rewritten to remove the controversies section which covers nearly 50% of the article. It's clearly compromises the encyclopaedic nature of the article and turns it into a list. I do hope to broadly re-write this article, but in the meantime I have reverted to the status quo, pending a consensus for the form of inclusion in this article. <strong><font style="color: #082567">[[User:Mvjs|Mvjs]]</font><font style="color: #000000">[[User talk:Mvjs|Talking]]</font></strong> 09:41, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

:Reliable sources have had significant coverage about PwC Australia's actions related to Trump and the gay marriage plebiscite. They belong in the article.

:The "... criticized in the media ..." sentence does not satisfy NPOV and should either be balanced with positive reactions, as described in [[WP:CRITS]] or removed.

:The structure of the article has a variety of problems, but the best way to address them is not to delete this section. The tone of the section should be improved.--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 22:15, 22 August 2017 (UTC)
::For the same-sex marriage plebiscite-related and Trump election content, this seems to have been inserted occasionally usually citing [[News Limited]] journalists [[Janet Albrechtsen]] and [[Miranda Devine]])), I still feel this falls into the [[WP:CRITS]] policy above: it is the ''critics'' making the commentary, rather than reliable sources. This policy is specifically designed to exclude encyclopaedic articles becoming repositories for the views of critics. I don't see sufficient coverage from sources that are ''other'' than the critics themselves. I don't believe this is the purpose of Wikipedia.

::Moreover, I'm unsure of the reliability of the sources, such as in relation to the Trump content, as there appears to be equally contradictory sources such as [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/letters/australian-of-the-year-award-needs-new-set-of-criteria/news-story/e75c5cb83318f1e2a4b0130cad8a46b8 this] and [http://www.afr.com/brand/rear-window/noel-pearson-a-false-prophet-the-murdoch-press-blindly-follows-20161124-gsxaic this]. I don't believe the commentary of the critics (or any articles which are associated with these articles) is tantamount to a reliable source.

::Finally, I'm still unconvinced that this content belongs in the article at all. [[WP:BALASPS]] is applicable here. This article is about a relatively large company operating across different jurisdictions. The section was discussing one individual, in one of these jurisdictions, and I'd regard this as undue weight being placed on a relatively minor, albeit recent, aspect of the subject.

::The solution I think is a re-write of this controversies section – a continued aim – but I don't believe that regardless, the content removed, is appropriate for this article. <strong><font style="color: #082567">[[User:Mvjs|Mvjs]]</font><font style="color: #000000">[[User talk:Mvjs|Talking]]</font></strong> 01:23, 23 August 2017 (UTC)
:::PwC's report on the same-sex marriage plebiscite received wide coverage in Australia and even some international coverage (for example: [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-35800173 Australia gay marriage vote 'will cost A$0.5bn' - BBC]). It should be in the article.
:::You've convinced me that the material about the Trump memo does not warrant inclusion.--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 07:28, 18 September 2017 (UTC)

An editor who was not logged in blanked the section with an edit summary saying it was "due to previous editorial findings for similar content. Additionally, these changes mainly consist of non PwC related issues that are personal in nature." What editorial findings are you referring to and what material do you think is not related to PwC?--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 22:14, 25 October 2017 (UTC)

::In response to [[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]], this was not an attempt to blank this section. Instead, and as previously stated above, the edits you have made contains a list of allegations that are personal in nature, which compromises the encyclopedic nature and intent of the article. Written in the manner that it was, it comes across as biased, with a sole intent of damaging the reputation of PwC Australia and the named individuals. The article is about PwC, a global firm, and listing the alleged individual views of one or more persons, and using this article to attack the alleged personal beliefs of individuals is inappropriate.

:::The only allegations are those by Ausbil in their lawsuit. When they are reported in a major newspaper like the The Sydney Morning Herald, allegations like this are often deemed appropriate to include, but perhaps we could agree to leave them out until the suit is resolved. 
:::The weight given to all of these issues is consistent with the standards of this article. I don't think the section has been written in a biased manner, but if you would like to rewrite this material without bias, I encourage you to. What, specifically, do you think is an attack on an individual or their beliefs?--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 00:18, 5 November 2017 (UTC)
::In response to [[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]], in the article, you state that CEO Luke Sayers has publicly supported gay marriage, but do not provide a source. You then imply that this support for gay marriage led to Luke Sayers directing a report to be written about the cost of the Plebiscite, which is also not supported by a source. This connection and the implication of impropriety is not supported by the sources provided. The only thing verifiable is the fact that a report was published. Your proposed language clearly does not satisfy NPOV. In the next item, concerning Centro, there is simply nothing that qualifies as a controversy. Controversy denotes some type of disagreement. If the case settled as alleged, then there is no ongoing controversy regarding Centro.
::My proposal, respectfully, is that these two items be simply removed. There is simply not enough there to constitute a controversy, and the connections that you attempt to make are not verifiable, aren't adequately supported by references, and appears to violate NPOV. [[User:Tripwirecegin|Tripwirecegin]] ([[User talk:Tripwirecegin|talk]]) 01:46, 14 November 2017 (UTC)
:::I think the Financial Review article supports the material about Mr. Sayers but, if you'd prefer, it's not necessary to mention him. We could simply say that the Australian firm supports gay marriage and prepared the report.
:::What impropriety do you think is being implied?
:::Please propose language that presents this material in a more neutral manner.
:::I think most people would agree that a lawsuit qualifies as a controversy, but it might be better to put material like this in a section of legal and regulatory issues. Most of the material in the Controversies section could be moved there.--[[User:SaskatchewanSenator|SaskatchewanSenator]] ([[User talk:SaskatchewanSenator|talk]]) 07:36, 14 November 2017 (UTC)

== Sources #1 & #2 conflict one another. ==

Source #1 (Forbes) lists the company as being headquartered in the United States. 

Source #2 (PwC's website) lists the company as being headquartered in the United Kingdom.

One assumes PwC's listing is technically correct.
