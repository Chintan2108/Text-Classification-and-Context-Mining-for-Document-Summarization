==Moved==
I've mostly copied and pasted parts from the [[Politics of Canada]] article. It needs work, so I hope there will be help. -[[User:PullUpYourSocks|PullUpYourSocks]] 01:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)
:I think your solution was great. As I commented on the [[Politics of Canada]] [[Talk:Politics_of_Canada#Requested_move|talk page]], there may be articles pointing there that really ought to link to this article. I assume the long list of articles already linking did so when this article was still a redirect, so it might not be necessary to undertake such a review. I'll keep my eyes open and take care of it if and when I get a chance. [[User:Agent 86|Agent 86]] 23:46, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

== Reference to Government ==

I think that this page should perhaps include a note at the top that would read something along the lines of:

''The '''Government of Canada''' often refers to the governing ministry, rather than the institution of government as a whole.  For this usage, see the [[28th Canadian Ministry|28th Ministry of Canada]].''

When I searched for Government of Canada, I was actually searching for a page about the ''current'' Government (as in the Conservative Government), and I think it would make sense if we had a quick link at the top to that effect.  Thoughts? [[User:Paradokuso|Paradokuso]] 06:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

== Usage ==

Should say this:

In [[Canadian English]], the word "[[government]]" is used to refer '''both''' to the whole set intitutions that govern the country (following American usage, but where Britons would use "[[state]]"), and to the current political leadership (following British usage, but where Americans would use "[[administration]]").  For example a Canadian could be a "government employee" but never a "state employee", and they would vote for the "[[Harper government]]" but never the "Harper administration".

Official government press releases traditionally do not use the name of the Prime Minister to identify the government. This is a fairly recent occurrence as the citation supports. It was also very controversial.<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tories-re-brand-government-in-stephen-harpers-name/article1929175/</ref> To say that it is general practice is somewhat misleading.[[User:Rich1542|Rich1542]] ([[User talk:Rich1542|talk]]) 17:38, 17 March 2013 (UTC)Rich1542

== Capitalization ==

Terms for offices such as governor general, prime minister, and premier appear to be capitalized inconsistently throughout the article. Is there a rationale for the current capitalization choices, or should I clean it up? -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 09:31, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
:After reviewing [[WP:Manual of Style (capital letters)#titles|the Manual of Style]], I think editors may have used its rule of thumb while ignoring the basic rule. The issue is general versus specific uses of "prime minister". Capitalize it when discussing the official title (''Prime Minister of Canada''), when using it as a prenomial title (''Prime Minister Stephen Harper''), or when using it to refer to a specific individual ("today the ''Prime Minister'' met with the premiers of Alberta and Ontario"). When writing of the office generally, it should be lower case. For example, "such appointments are made on the advice of the ''prime minister''". -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 16:07, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

The usage here doesn't seem to gel with similar articles, such as [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch]], where "President" is used throughout, although forms such as "presidential" or "presidency" are uncapitalised. This is usual in written English. One talks of "a president" but "the President". As with "Queen" and "Governor-General". --[[User:Skyring|Pete]] ([[User talk:Skyring|talk]]) 04:12, 16 December 2011 (UTC)
:Rrius correctly summarises the Manual of Style above. In the sentence "she appoints as her viceregal representative in Canada a governor general", "governor general" refers to the office generally. It therefore should not be capitalised in that context. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 22:52, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

==The constitutional powers and rights of the Crown==
:My suggestion is that the facts be simply presented as thus, which is that the executive power of the country is vested in the Crown (i.e. the Queen and Governor General). Thus, Forsey's interpretation is entirely correct as the standard in law. As the quoted Canadian public service article itself states:
:::<small>Since Canada is a constitutional monarchy, the Queen is the head of state in whom full executive power is vested. When the Queen is not in Canada, she is represented by the Governor General, who exercises the legal powers of the Crown on her behalf. For the most part, the Governor General exercises these powers “with the advice” or the “advice and consent” of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada ... The executive power of the government is extensive ... Under the constitution these powers are exercised by the Crown on the advice of the elected government of the day. At issue is whether the convention leaves any discretionary decision-making room in the hands of the Crown, that is, room not to follow the advice of the government and instead to do something else. If the Crown is to serve as a check on the government of the day, it must possess a discretionary power. Otherwise, it is simply a rubber stamp of the government’s actions.</small>
:Then the CSPS goes on to state:
:::<small>Forsey’s credibility as an authority on these matters notwithstanding, many Canadians today would find these scenarios unthinkable. Thankfully, they are not used to seeing Prime Ministers act unconstitutionally and naturally would regard such concerns as overblown. '''Furthermore, they might view the exercise of the reserve power of the Crown as undemocratic because the Crown is not an elected institution''' ...  Yet the system of responsible government needs a head of state with enough independence to withstand a determined government’s assault on the constitution, although not enough to interfere in democratic politics.</small>
:I bolded that one sentence because it is referring to the Canadian people. It is not presenting an official or legal opinion, but rather hypothesizing a possible reaction on the part of the Canadian populace in the event of the Crown exercising its executive power, which normally is viewed as ceremonial and symbolic by the population. However, the gist of what the article is talking about is that in reality, the power of the Crown is '''not''' ceremonial or symbolic - far from it. The CSPS is further stipulating that the Crown '''must''' retain this ability to counteract the government in the event of a constitutional crisis.
:So, we simply need to state the facts, which is that the Crown has real (as opposed to symbolic or ceremonial) executive power and has the right to exercise that power if it so chose, which normally it does not, except under those circumstances when the government is acting unconstitutionally, which in this day and age, is quite rare. If I'm not mistaken, none of the editors disputes any of this, and the CSPS basically states exactly this, and this is a publicaation which is intended primarily for public servants.
:However, the Liberal Party has a different opinion. They believe that the Crown has absolutely no right whatsoever to exercise its executive power independently. In other words, the Liberals have a very controversial disagreement with the constitution, and this is not surprising considering the level of republican sentiment in the Liberal Party, so this is consistent with the direction that they've been heading in for years, i.e. attempting to transform the Crown into a purely ceremonial institution or eliminate it altogether. But that's just my opinion.

:: The paper doesn't take a position on the powers of the GG. It reviews the POV of monarchists Forsey (which is essentially the POV that you summarize above}, and summarizes the POV of most Canadians and Liberal governments (i.e. that the Crown would not have the democratic legitimacy to interfere in Canadian politics. It reviews various opinions on the matter. It's also not Republican to believe that the GG or monarch should have no discretionary powers. It just means that you believe the Crown should be strictly ceremonial, which it has been since 1926.

== Monarchy ==

I recently moved the monarchy section down the body of the article. The move was reverted citing "precedence". The monarchy has very little relevance in the modern Canadian government and should not be one of the first focal points of the article. For a reader not familiar with the government it would appear that the nation is ruled by the monarch in day to day affairs, which is obviously misleading. The section should be moved down to allow for more focus on relevant government information of "today's" Canada. After all this isn't the 1800's.

As the article is written, it makes more sense to have the monarch first, and I'm not sure that rewriting it would really make a difference. Neutered or not, the Crown connects each of the other sections: Executive, legislature, judiciary, and federalism. It would be weird to discuss those in sequence, then say, "Oh, by the way, here is this other thing that ties the others together and is where sovereignty comes from." I say this as an American (and let's please skip the "As an American, you couldn't possibly know what you're talking about" drivel) who has no ax to grind in the monarchist-republican debate. Canada is a constitutional monarchy, and what that higher level concept means should be dealt with before trying to explain the machinery of government. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 18:45, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
:I agree, but I feel it should be mentioned in the lead with a brief description, and the main section with a lengthy description below.

== Queen-in-Council?? (definition of the term "government") ==

The introduction currently states, "in Canadian English, the term can mean either the collective set of institutions or specifically the Queen-in-Council." I believe that the word government in Canadian English can refer to more than just those two things. In addition, forgive my ignorance, but I am confused about what the "Queen-in-Council" even is. The "Queen-in-Council" article itself is a stub and I found it difficult to understand. Is there some way this sentence could be re-written to make it clearer and more comprehensive? I didn't want to just go ahead and edit it without an understanding on what the "Queen-in-Council" is. I am a Canadian and I have never heard that term used before. Is it perhaps an antiquated term that is not regularly used in the public vernacular? And, when I think about it, the phrase "the collective set of institutions" could be a bit clearer as well. Thoughts? [[User:MsBatfish|MsBatfish]] ([[User talk:MsBatfish|talk]]) 11:24, 17 October 2011 (UTC)

ADDITION: I also noticed under Usage that there is a similar definition:
"In Canadian English, the word government is used to refer both to the whole set of institutions that collectively govern the country as well as the reigning monarch, or her viceroy, in her current council; when used in the latter context, the word is usually capitalized to make the distinction.[10] Thus, Canadians would say the 28th Ministry is the Government that currently administers the Canadian government. Contrasts can be drawn with the British usage — where the government is synonymous with the state — and the American usage — where the Government is synonymous with the administration."

Is it really true that the word government is used in Canada to refer to "the reigning monarch or her viceroy"?? Meaning that the Queen of England is the "government" of Canada?

Another sentence of this paragraph that I would dispute is that "Contrasts can be drawn with the British usage — where the government is synonymous with the state — and the American usage — where the Government is synonymous with the administration" - in the public vernacular the administration is often referred to as "the government". If the article is making a distinction between the technical or legal meaning of the term "government" as opposed to the way the term is widely used by the people, perhaps this distinction should be outlined?

* Thank you [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]] I wish the article on the "Queen in Council" was clearer! Although I did mean the current monarch of the UK, sorry if I didn't use the correct term. So are you saying she is the "Queen of Canada in Council"? So I guess that is a technical/legal definition then, as opposed to a vernacular one? No one refers to the governor general as "the government". But I'm still not sure how one would go about making the article easier to understand?
: Another thing I noticed is that the article states that there is a distinction between the meaning of the word government as used by the Canadian public as opposed to as used by the American public and that no one in Canada would refer to the administration as the government.

I would also dispute the statement "Contrasts can be drawn with the British usage — where the government is synonymous with the state — and the American usage — where the Government is synonymous with the administration" I favor either citing a reference supporting it or removing it. My argue for removing follows: the American Federal Constitution specifies a "seat of Government" but does not limit the capital "G" Government as being an administration, or president or congress (etc.).  An example of this non-localization of the term Government is found in the American Federal Bill of Rights, where it states in the first amendment, it part, ".. petition the Government for a redress of grievances..".  Who is petitioned? The amendment does not direct (or limit) petitioning action towards the President, Congress or Courts.  Instead it leaves it open ended.

I have restored the old wording that was correct and understandable. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 09:17, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Would the anon user {{user|2.27.78.52}}/{{user|2.25.186.230}}/{{user|2.27.81.7}} care to explain why he/she feels allowed to disregard [[WP:LR]]: "Do not delete cited information solely because the URL to the source does not work any longer. WP:Verifiability does not require that all information be supported by a working link"? Further, how the word "dominion" disqualifies a source; [[WP:RS]] makes no mention of it. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 01:00, 17 January 2015 (UTC)

::* [http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/frequently-asked-questions-faq]: "The Governor General, as the Queen's representative in Canada, reads the Speech from the Throne prepared by the government of the day, which is ''Her Majesty's government''."
