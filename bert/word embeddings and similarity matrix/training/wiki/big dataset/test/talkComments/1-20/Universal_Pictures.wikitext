Universal Pictures was incorporated in [[1915]].  Remember, they've celebrated its 75th Anniversary in [[1990]].  [[User:King Shadeed|King Shadeed]] 15:04, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

They may have said 1912, but on March 15, 1915, it was officially opened. So therefore, it would be 1915 instead of 1912. [[User:King Shadeed|King Shadeed]] 15:12, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

No. Universal was officially founded in 1912, otherwise it wouldn't be the second oldest studio in Hollywood (Next to Paramount Pictures). Do not state this nonsense again.--[[User:B5JH|B5JH]] 00:45, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

==Fire update==
I am watching the live broadcast of the press conference regarding the fire. The head and CEO of Universal Studios has announced that it was a VIDEO vault building, not a FILM vault that was destroyed, and that the studio's main film vault is not affected. Furthermore, nothing in the video vault is considered irreplaceable, he says. Presumably a print version that can be cited will be available shortly. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] ([[User talk:23skidoo|talk]]) 16:25, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
* It might be worth policing studio-related aritcles to make sure false or incorrect information isn't included. I just reverted a change at the article for [[Wisteria Lane]] that said the fire occurred there, which of course it did not. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] ([[User talk:23skidoo|talk]]) 17:21, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

Shouldn't the photo of this section be both a shot of the fire being fought and also the courthouse square set, the most famous set destroyed? [[User:Cs302b|Cs302b]] ([[User talk:Cs302b|talk]]) 19:19, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

I just fixed a major error - why was this section still saying the FILM vault was destroyed? The head of CEO, quoted on CNN, said it was the video vault, which is a different facility altogether. [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] ([[User talk:23skidoo|talk]]) 23:34, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
*This section should be merged to [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] instead because '''that''' seems to be the more relevant, more specific article. [[User:Zzyzx11|Zzyzx11]] [[User talk:Zzyzx11|(Talk)]] 00:22, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

===Put off===
It's off but the damages are irreparable: 400 firefighters battled the blaze, and at least 5 firemen suffered minor injuries, from heat exhaustion and burns. The second fire since the 1990 blaze was finally out after 12 hours, at 4:45 a.m. on Sunday, after firefighters encountered low water pressure. Destroyed were 40,000 to 50,000 archived videos chronicling Universal's movie and TV classic shows, dating back to the 1920s, including the films “[[Knocked Up]]” and “[[Atonement]],” the [[NBC]] series “[[Law & Order]],” “[[The Office]],” [[Miami Vice]] and [[I Love Lucy]].

==HBO Pacific Partners VOF==

According to this link...

http://www.spacenewsfeed.co.uk/2004/20June2004_5.html

...Universal Studios is one of a handful of partners in creating the holding company "HBO Pacific Partners VOF."  I've been unable to find documentation on when that creation occurred and exact industry specs for it.  Does anyone know any info that can be added?

(Here is the text from the link to which I'm referring.)

"Singapore-based HBO Asia brings the best of Hollywood to Asia through its exclusive first-run licensing deals with major Hollywood studios including Columbia Tri/Star, DreamWorks, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. In addition to proprietary and award-winning HBO Original programming produced exclusively for its viewers, HBO Asia works with a number of prominent independent studios to secure exclusive rights to a host of quality movies. HBO Pacific Partners, VOF is a joint venture of media giants Paramount Films, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Time Warner and Universal Studios."

HBO Pacific Partners is also stated as the holding company primarily involved in a current (July, 2008) Spider-Man 3 contest for viewers in India.

http://hbo.magnonsolutions.co.in/spiderman3/terms-conditions.html#term

My interest is in expanding the available data on that holding company that can be inserted to all relevant entries.  (Time-Warner, HBO Asia, Paramount Films, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal Studios, etc.)

(If anyone is keeping score at home, yes, I'm going to the talk pages for each of these companies and pretty much pasting this same request with minor edits in my search for this data.  If that's overkill, please accept my apologies.  Mea culpa...)

Thank you.

:''Continued from [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Films#Universal Pictures or Studios]]''
There is interest in either creating a section or a separate article for Universal Pictures, which is distinct from Universal Studios (in the sense of being one of its arms).  I looked at the databases for the trade papers ''Variety'' and ''The Hollywood Reporter'', and I could provide some rotating-door history about Universal Pictures (leadership coming and going).  We can either start a section in this article now or set up a sandbox to shape the content until we can figure out where to put it.

:::::::::Sorry, yes, one person quickly made a note. However thus far, there is no consensus for it and nothing to support that is the best way of addressing the issue or topic.

:::::::::: I am open-minded about the idea of creating a Universal Pictures section in the already existed page.  I just don't quite know how to do it.... But I would try to find more infos to bulid the section when we have consensus about what we should do. --  [[User:Marychan41|Marychan41]] ([[User talk:Marychan41|talk]]) 16:14, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

::It should have a separate section as part of a list of divisions, rather than in the history. One person thinks it "deserves" its own article, but unless and until there is evidence of significant coverage by itself that shows it should have one, I see no valid reason to do a split. A separate section seems more than sufficient to me. -- [[User:AnmaFinotera|<span style='font-family: "Comic Sans MS"; color:#5342FF'>AnmaFinotera</span>]]&nbsp;([[User talk:AnmaFinotera|talk]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/AnmaFinotera|contribs]]) 18:57, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

I concur with AnmaFinotera. [[Walt Disney Pictures]] isn't much more than a stub, and about half of it is just a "See also" list of links to other articles.  

What if following the lead this article was rearranged as follows:
;Universal Pictures
:;Early years
:;"Oswald" fallout gives rise to "Mickey Mouse" and Disney empire
:;Keeping leadership of the studio in the family
:;The Laemmles lose control
;Universal-International
;MCA takes over
;Matsushita and Vivendi
;NBC Universal

This would give Universal Pictures a separate section divided into four sub-sections to make reading it easier. Just a suggestion. [[User:MovieMadness|MovieMadness]] ([[User talk:MovieMadness|talk]]) 20:49, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

:I really think history should be history of the company as a whole. Universal Pictures would then be a descriptive section. -- [[User:AnmaFinotera|<span style='font-family: "Comic Sans MS"; color:#5342FF'>AnmaFinotera</span>]]&nbsp;([[User talk:AnmaFinotera|talk]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/AnmaFinotera|contribs]]) 21:40, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

::Doesn't the history of Universal Studios begin with the creation of Universal Pictures? I'm not sure what you mean by a "descriptive section" - do you mind elaborating?

Shouldn't the locations link to wikipedia pages rather than the company websites? I believe wikipedia pages would be more informative and useful than the company location or park websites. [[User:Ihafez|Ihafez]] ([[User talk:Ihafez|talk]]) 00:11, 17 September 2012 (UTC)
== Intro needs a source? ==

Do we need a source here?? "Three of Universal Studios' films—Jaws (1975), E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Jurassic Park (1993), all of which were directed by Steven Spielberg—achieved box office records, each becoming the highest-grossing film at the time."
