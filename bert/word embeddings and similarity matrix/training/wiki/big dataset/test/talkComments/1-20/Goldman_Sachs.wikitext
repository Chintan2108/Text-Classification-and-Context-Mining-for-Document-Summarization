==Opening Paragraph==
To whomever is changing the opening paragraph to depict GS as a criminal enterprise, please respect the nature of wikipedia and refrain from adding your own personal opinions. I understand that you may have strong feelings about Goldman Sachs, but Wikipedia is intended to be a neutral source of basic information, not an outlet for your personal opinions. If you would like to rant about your feelings on GS I'm sure that there are numerous forums where you could share your ideas, but it is not appropriate for you to add your personal analysis of GS on wikipedia. I am not disagreeing with your views on GS, I am merely asking you to respect the purpose of Wikipedia. Millions of people use Wikipedia every day as a source of legitimate, unbiased information, so please do not vandalize this or any other wiki page.   <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.111.128.166|75.111.128.166]] ([[User talk:75.111.128.166|talk]]) 00:51, 1 February 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:I agree that depictions of it as a criminal enterprise are wrong, but it is also strange to not see the fact that the govenrment agency responsible for monitoring it as well as federal prosecutors have charged the corporation with violations of federal laws, which is to say a crime, specifically fraud,  involving hundreds of billions of dollars. Why would that fact not be in the lede graph? I can understand leaving out criminal investigations in the UK and Germany until further down, lots of companies are investigated, but charges of criminal fraud are in fact one of the most noteworthy facts concerning Goldman. Are we really saying that the street address of goldman, or spelling out that it is "lower manhandle" belong in the first graph and are more important fact that it is target than one of the biggest fraud prosecutions in US history? (Also why the second graph, has vry old facts about a former employee being a former treasury secretary, which seems highly political motivated statement, given that one does NOT see that in first or second graphs of Merill wiki page, that Don Regan was Treas Sec after being CEO and chairman of Merill? (or half a dozen similar examples)[[User:Jenston|Jenston]] ([[User talk:Jenston|talk]])

The IP 75.111.128.166 is actively removing any criticism of Goldman Sachs, in the name of 'Wikipedia objectivity'.
Following the same logic, all criticism of Stalin, Hitler and Mao  crimes should be removed as well.
Also, what credentials does the 75.111.128.166 have on the subject of financial industry. The history of his edits
shows topics such as 'Hokkaido University','Prokaryotis' and 'Age disparity in sexual relations'.
It appears that he is a human bot, hired by Goldman Sachs to cleanse the page of any negative information. Otherwise, in the words of Lenin, just an 'useful idiot' which is a historical term to describe low-information people acting on impulse against their own best interest.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.100.247.156|184.100.247.156]] ([[User talk:184.100.247.156|talk]]) 17:27, 24 September 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Inaccuracies==

The last sentence of the opening paragraph contains three factual errors:

1. "Goldman was the largest donor to both Barack Obama..."

The University of California was. (http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?id=N00009638&cycle=2008)

2. "... and John McCain in the 2008 presidential election".

Merrill Lynch was. (http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?id=N00006424&cycle=2008)

3. "... former Goldman Sachs employees such as Timothy Geithner and Hank Paulson..."

Geithner, according to an extensive web search, never worked for Goldman Sachs, in any capacity.

Does anyone object to the article being corrected?
[[User:B0rez|B0rez]] ([[User talk:B0rez|talk]]) 11:00, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Actually, no corporation can contribute to a political campaign, nor can unions, and a lot of other corporate enities.  Whether individuals employed by a corporation share the political views of the corporation is uncertain, and generally suspect.  Do GM's union workers contribute based on being aligned with their union management or GM management?  While the number of Goldman partners and employees going into public service is notable, it is unclear whether they favor Democratic or Republican or liberal or conservative political positions.  [[User:Mulp|Mulp]] ([[User talk:Mulp|talk]]) 00:13, 30 March 2009 (UTC)
: Mulp, You are 2100% incorrect. That is a highly inaccurate characterization of assessing political contributions. 
: Employee Contributions: In fact the FEC forms specifically ask for employment data for a reason, and all monitoring groups aggregate donations from employees of a corporation for a reason as well. Please go to opensecrets.org, which is the largest and most respected and non partisan watchdog group reporting on contributions, or for that matter the FEC site itself, or the record of congressional hearings on contributions to see how they ALL put these aggregations of individual contributions by company and industry, and specifically that number -- at the top of their  lists for data presentation. 

: Soft Money: You are also factually well off the mark when you say corporations cannot contribute. . Corporations directly contribute to parties all the time.  Are you saying Godlman cannot or has not written directly from its CORPORATE checkbook. Either Goldmans own financial are fraudulent or they are writing direct checks to political parties. The exclusion there is corporate to federal elections, but corporations, unions and organizations (including goldman) can and do give to the huge general political party funds and non federal funds which are in essence fungible (and that is why those are tracked).

:PACS: Goldman has a PAC which is huge and very active. You can see it REGISTERED with FEC. So millions in federal contributions from the Goldman Sachs PAC? here are the ~$one million expenditures for the Goldman Sachs INc PAC for 2009: http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expend.php?cmte=C00350744&cycle=2008

:527 Groups. Just check the wiki article. these are now in the hundreds of millions, expressly political and massively funded by corporations, unions and organizations

: To other editors. Sorry to belabor the point, but Goldman sachs is not just a big political contributor, but one of the biggest, and the idea that they are not, asserted at the first screen users see the talk page is grossly misleading. http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000085 [[User:Jenston|Jenston]] ([[User talk:Jenston|talk]]) 15:50, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

I'm puzzled by why there is no mention of the events that affected Goldman Sachs and the financial world in general in 2008 which lead to the creation of the TARP funds and Wall Street bailout, and Goldman Sachs' acceptance of the funds which lead to its metamorphosis from an investment bank to a "bank holding company".  Certainly, these events were a major milestone in Goldman Sachs history and should be addressed.  

:It is just an observation, why would a spokesman for Goldman Sachs make a comment that oil will go to 149.00 by the end of the year and immediatly the price jumps on their comment.  It leaves one to wonder what they may have to gain at the expense of the american people.  Why else make a public comment which sparks an immediate rise to oil, while it was on a downslide in spite of the Russia/Georgia ordeal.  What other means will be dealt to keep oil inflated and keep the economies in an inflationary mode, killing the little people and jumping profits for the already rich.

Why is when information of a negative and secretive nature which may be true always written off as a "conspiracy theory" Wikipedia is about accurate information regardless if you deem it a "conspiracy theory" Sadly the running contemporary behavior of the United States government and its corporate allies is secretive in nature the fact that this article is sadly lacking the accurate portrayal of the Goldman Sachs actions during 2007-2009. Example being the exemption from CTFC regulations allowing Goldman Sachs to operate in commodities market in which it was not a supplier or consumer and allowed to manipulate the price of oil by using it like stocks which was why gas was up to $4.11 in 2008. In 2008 a barrel of oil was traded 27 times, on average, before it was actually delivered and consumed. All I ask is that the writers of wikipedia take a serious look at data that some choose to write off as "conspiracy theory" material, just because it is named as such does not necessarily mean that the information is inaccurate.

:As you said, "Wikipedia is about accurate information."  Also, re: the previous comment, every time an investment bank speaks, let along about something as speculative as oil prices, the market jumps. Investors pile in after things like that, and have been since the very beginning of markets. It's not "suspicious" in the least. —[[User:DMCer|<span style="color:#008000">'''DMCer'''</span>]][[User_talk:DMCer|<span style="color:#800000">™</span>]] 06:44, 30 November 2009 (UTC)

==Links to other GS information==
Hi -- I thought [http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Goldman_Sachs_Group_(GS) this article] might be a useful external link -- it discusses GS from more of an investor's perspective (how they compare to their competitors, how their business works and key issues impacting it, etc) rather than the cultural / encyclopedic one on Wikipedia. What do folks think -- worth adding a link at the end? Many users will undoubtably be looking for this kind of information. [[User:Parkerconrad|Parkerconrad]] 20:54, 18 September 2007 (UTC)
:Wikipedia isn't really a place to "discuss" as much as define I think.  That site doesn't cite sources, and spends a lot of fluff on describing the terminology (Private Equity would be a good example) rather than commenting on Goldman's place in the sector.  You're welcome to add whatever you want, but I think a better source can be found.  Plus, your connection with the site (on your user page) worries me a little bit as well.

==Vandalism==
The following IP addresses have been adding the same edits continuously:
[[User:80.43.67.151]], [[User:80.41.71.86]], [[User:80.41.106.239]], [[User:80.43.65.45]], [[User:61.14.24.21]]. These edits are highly NPOV (referring to alumni as criminals and felons). I have removed all opinionated language in the areas that these edits are entered. I rewrote the summary before the alumni listing and have shifted David Brown and Robert Freeman into the Other category as Criminals is a highly biased entry name. I noticed that [[User:80.43.65.45]] added an entry to [[David Brown]] as well even though there is no such article about a David Brown from Goldman Sachs. This really leads me to believe there is vandalism here. I'm giving you this chance to explain your views so we can resolve this conflict and ask that you write articles for both men that covers their biographies. Otherwise, there really isn't a reason to have them in here as they aren't explained anywhere else or have any articles to cite. [[User:Thesilence|Thesilence]] 20:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
:I can't speak for their motivations, but the article could do with a *Criticism* section to make it more balanced.

I am going to put the Criminals section back in, and move Freeman and Brown to it. Although you may not like it, they are convicted felons (both served time for the crimes that they committed while at Goldman). You say you have never heard of David Brown??? I find that hard to believe. Talk to any Goldman person - certainly any partner/MD - they know of him. In any event, it is inappropriate to try to hide them in an "Other" category. A convicted felon is a convicted felon. And they didn't get probation - they served time. It is a part of Goldman/Giuliani lore that Freeman was handcuffed in his office and was lead away in tears. What I would like to suggest - now that you have opened up this discussion - is to have a separate section devoted to the insider trading mess/convictions, and detail how the Freeman arrest and conviction stemmed from the arrest of Ivan Boesky, i.e. give a detailed discussion of how it went from Boesky to Siegal to "Bunny" Lasker and then finally the inside information went to Freeman, and that he traded on it, both for his own account and for Goldman's account. And how he and Goldman denied it for three years until he finally pleaded guilty in 1989. Perhaps it should also be noted that Freeman was Rubin's protege - his right hand man (Rubin turned the department over to him). Thanks for bringing all this up.

I am going to reinsert the full quote about the "Goldman-sponsored pyramid scheme" that you vandalized. I am putting in the link. It is to The New York Times, so I think that is good enough. After all, Goldman never sued The New York Times over this. Can I say something to you "Thesilence"? Take your personal opinions elsewhere!!!

* First, I should state that I worked at Goldman Sachs briefly. In training, you learn about Freeman and Brown and are admonished to avoid their mistakes. Still, there's a lot of corrupt (or at least unethical) stuff going on there. But that's endemic throughout the entire industry and not solely a Goldman Sachs problem. HOWEVER, removing information that shows Goldman Sachs in a bad light renders this article into a mindless "Cheerleader piece", and that, I'll assert is a major POV violation. This article needs to include criticism of the subject in order to be neutral and somewhat balanced. Does the negative deserve equal coverage? Probably not since I doubt the bad apples equal the good. BUT, as long as information is referenced, it should never be removed unless justified by better referenced information. If cited information is removed just because it is a negative portrayal of the subject, that ''is'' vandalism. &mdash;[[User:ExplorerCDT|ExplorerCDT]] 18:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
:::First off, I removed what looked like common vandalism. The information had been removed prior to my removal once and had been labeled as spam before being reinserted by another random IP address from the same ISP. In fact, I think the same person is continuing to undo any attempt to undo their edits. If you are, please get a login name so you can receive credit for your contribution. Now, I cleaned up the edits a bit and moved them around. You still don't have a reference for David Brown but have linked to an article with no reference about him and you have no reference for Robert Freeman either. Please either create the article for David Brown or remove the encyclopedia link. The New York Times article I cannot access (I refuse to get a login to the NYT) but looks like a book review. I can't verify it so if someone else wants to that's fine. No, this shouldn't be a "Puff Piece" about the company but nowhere do I see any of the other investment banks with this kind of text in their articles. Personally, I think the fault lies in the fact that it's a timeline and list of alumni that easily opens it up to criticism. The best thing to do is rewrite in Prose as suggested above and eliminate the lists altogether.[[User:Thesilence|Thesilence]] 22:56, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
::::* It's a logical fallacy to say "I don't see it there, so it doesn't belong here". It's in the same category of "if your friends jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you?" Your refusal to check the NYT article isn't grounds to dismiss a claim. Get the terminology right...it's not that you ''cannot'' access it. It's that you plain ''won't''. This isn't a case of uncontrollable inability. It's a deliberate refusal. If you're afraid of cookies, Wikipedia probably has put more cookies on your computer. Your idea of "common vandalism" is disingenuous. From your reversions, I'd gander you wouldn't recognize common vandalism if it were starring you down and saying..."Hi, I'm common vandalism". Your first, and more appropriate response would have been to tag it <nowiki>{{citation needed}} or {{fact}}</nowiki> and waited to see if it was cited. If not, then away it goes.

The David Brown conviction is WELL known on Wall Street, and even more so at Goldman Sachs. One of you (Elipongo) was unable to even realise that that "petition" did not have to do with Brown's conviction. Anywhere, here is a link to CNN that mentions the conviction: http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1986/12/22/68462/index.htm. And where TheSilence got off saying that other link had sex on it, I will never know. Must have been a banner ad or something. THINK before you edit.

As for this debate here, it's not about "winning", it's about building a consensus. Other editors and myself have been telling you exactly what you have to do to "win" here- i.e. create a section entitled *Criticism* and write a paragraph or two in a properly encyclopedic, neutral tone. State the facts, not opinions or judgements; e.g. "Joe Blow was convicted in Federal court for securities fraud." is a statement of fact; "Joe blow is a criminal." is a judgement. And before you object to it, the term "criminal" is indeed a judgement- George Washington though a hero to the Americans, was a criminal as far as the British were concerned; he would have been hanged for treason if we hadn't won the war. On the other extreme, all of Adolf Hitler's actions during the Third Reich were conducted within the framework of German law.

==Puff Piece==


This article reads as a puff piece, omitting any criticism of Goldman, its role in the research and other scandals of the late 1990s. Recently, Goldman has come under considerable fire (particularly in Britain)for conflicts of interest surrounding its principal investments in private equity and the activities of its private equity funds. While Goldman seems to get away with a lot more of this sort of thing than its rivals, it does have quite a reputation for arrogance on Wall Street. Its archrival is Morgan Stanley--entertainingly enough, Goldman employees tend to refer to Morgan Stanley as 'the evil empire'--and vice versa[[User:12.111.30.89|12.111.30.89]]jsl

:I titled this so it would be in-line with the rest of the discussion. Wikipedia is not a newspaper, it's an encyclopedia. It really shouldn't attack or support its subjects. If you have sources and news articles related to Goldman's "scandals", then insert them into the article and cite them. If I recall correcty, Goldman was fined the least for problems with the analyst scandal and hasn't even been touched by the options backdating. As for the 'evil empire' - that's kind of irrelevant and pointless trivia IMO.  [[User:Thesilence|Thesilence]] 05:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

While portions of the article do seem like PR, the recent additions do have significant historical value, and the description of alternative mortgage products does seem to be in keeping with the idea of an encyclopedia- it's part and parcel of the events that led to the current financial crisis. But- given the similarity of content and the length of the article, should this portion be combined with the criticism/controversy para above it?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dogpa14|Dogpa14]] ([[User talk:Dogpa14|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dogpa14|contribs]]) 04:20, 25 September 2008 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I have no personal ax to grind with them but I was shocked when I read this Wikipedia entry on Goldman Sachs! It reads like it was written in the GS Public Relations department. The "Criticism and controversy" section is a pathetic joke. Major criticisms of GS such as their incestuous relationship with the US Treasury Dept, among other serious things, are not even mentioned. I would very much like everyone with a current or former business relationship with GS to state that fact when editing the entry. I also think that it would be the ethical thing for an editor  to admit that editing the entry is part of his employment. I myself have never had any relationship with them whatsoever. Also, it seems to me that "thesilence" has an inordinate influence on what the entry will look like while carrying an obvious bias in favor of Goldman Sachs. Sorry if that offends, but that's the way it looks to me.   [[Special:Contributions/75.164.153.79|75.164.153.79]] ([[User talk:75.164.153.79|talk]]) 10:39, 19 November 2007 (UTC)dwargo

Goldman started out in the garment business. [[Special:Contributions/199.66.11.253|199.66.11.253]] ([[User_talk:199.66.11.253|Talk]])

==Earnings vs. Revenues==
In the investment banking section of the intro, it says that segment ''"accounts for around 15 percent of Goldman Sach's revenues".'' In the asset management section of the intro, it states that part ''"accounts for around 19 percent of Goldman Sach's earnings".''

To evaluate the financial contribution of each segment, these should be parallel numbers, either earnings or revenues (or both)... but it should not alternate between the two. [[User:Uris|Uris]][[I ♥ NY|<font color="#DD0000">&#9829;</font>]] ([[User_talk:Uris|Talk]]) 18:47, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

==Known as "The Firm" in some financial circles==
I'm a bit curious about this: I've never heard Goldman referred to as "The Firm" (in caps) in any sense other than that of current Goldman employees talking about "the firm" (lower case) in the same way that ''any'' employees talk about ''their own'' firm as "the firm". Can we have a citation please? [[User:87.74.103.131|87.74.103.131]] 21:20, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
:Actually, I have been bold and made the change. I have also removed reference to Audrey McNiff and Abby Joseph Cohen as key people - not because, strictly speaking, they're not key - they're both senior partners of the firm - but because, institutionally, they are no more key than any of the other partners of the firm (of which there are hundreds). The remaining key people listed hold formal institutional roles which make them key "ex cathedra". [[User:87.74.103.131|87.74.103.131]] 21:35, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
::I worked briefly for an outsourcing company that had a contract with Goldman Sachs. I was asked/directed to refer to GS as "the firm" in conversation, and to avoid discussing my work at GS (which was by no means anything very sensitive) as a general rule.

::I think there may be a justification for referring to Goldman Sachs JBWere as my understanding is that this is a joint-venture, and its ownership structure varies from that of the Goldman Sachs Group (in particular, the former shareholders of JBWere now hold shares in Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty Ltd alongside the Goldman Sachs Group, as per this link http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our_firm/media_center/articles/press_release_2003_article_030326180114.html).

==Rewrite==
Per [[User:Yandman|Yandman's]] prompting, I have rewriten the article and he has overwritten the old one. I tried as much as possible to keep as much of the timeline in place only in prose format as well as reference the more famous debacles, criticisms, and accomplishments in the firm's history using accurate sources. I'd like to see the article stay like this. A few notes about the rewrite:
*Please edit grammatical and spelling errors as you catch them of course; I know there are a few.
*Let's try and keep the alumni list short. There were a lot of dead links in the previous list and a lot of pointers to stubs as well. If the person is key to the firm's history, hasn't been mentioned in the article, or is extremely famous (Sascha Baron Cohen for example) then they should be added. People like CNBC anchors are a little more questionable I think.
*I'm also a little hesitant about the Current Goldman Sachs holding list and I don't think it's very accurate - Goldman has extensive holdings in many public and private companies, as everyone in that industry does. The link seems to reference only holdings in Computer companies.

== Citing Alumni already mentioned in article ==

Per the recent edits of [[User:ExplorerCDT]] and [[User:Yandman]], I'd like to head off an edit war and talk it out here. I hopefully have reverted to the most recent copy edited by Elipongo, and let's leave it at that until we've talked this through. I deleted all references to people who are mentioned in the article because if we mention everyone already mentioned, I think it's redundant. I also think it's pointless to include 7 references for one person in an article not about them. If you want to create a Robert Freeman article and link it there, go ahead. However, we already have a great reference (NY Magazine) regarding him and I think any more is unnecessary. I think that [[JPMorgan Chase]] is a good example of another article that does this as well. Note that Jamie Dimon, the CEO and biggest face of that company right now, is not referenced down in alumni, just like William B Harrison Jr.[[User:Thesilence|Thesilence]] 16:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
* Your reversions to delete referenced material appear (even if not deliberaly) that you're cherry picking information that omits or whitewashes the negative side of GoldmanSachs. Removing cited information is disingenuous, especially if it's negative material. There's no reason that this information shouldn't be included in "Notable Alumni" because often it gets lost in article text. From your recent edits, it is fair to say that you and Elipongo have gone on a consistent campaign to make this a warm-and-fuzzy, Goldman-is-great, We-love-Goldman article, and this POV cheerleading makes me wonder about possible conflicts of interest and POVs. The copyedit by Elipongo removes a lot of the teeth (and verifiable accuracy) from any criticism or controversy, and regarding Freeman, is sorely inaccurate (especially regarding the Boesky situation). &mdash;[[User:ExplorerCDT|ExplorerCDT]] 17:07, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

This section, added by Ivankinsman, consisted of largely of a copy of an email claimed to have been sent to the firm.  Since emails are generally not [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], I have removed it - also because [[WP:QUOTE]] recommends strongly against replication of primary sources.  The section also included two sentences critical of Goldman-Sachs' actions in the sub-prime mortgage crisis and their recent actions on the gold market.  However, the cited sources are not critical of the company, merely reporting on the activity as a successful strategy.  I agree that a section on criticisms of the firm is a very good thing to have, but copies of emails and mis-cited newspaper articles are not acceptable sources.

However, a block quote of an anonymous email is never a reliable source and should not be copied back into the article.  If you really insist on outside evaluation, wait a day or so and maybe file a [[WP:RFC]].  I would much prefer that you find suitable sources and re-write the section, however.

::: OK MichaelBusch, as a good Wikipedian, I take your point here. I admit that I rather acted on the 'spur of the moment' and have now written a much more considered piece backed up by solid references/reliable sources that actually do criticise the company for first selling subprime loans and then shorting them. I would like to state here that I have no 'personal grudge' here against GS (why should I? Your viewpoint seems to be that criticising a company's investment policies = bearing a grudge (rather subjective I think). I simply want to state the facts regarding GS' role in the recent subprime crisis that has hit both the US and UK hard (as well as major banks in other countries).

::I can indent posts, but if I did that sequentially, we'd run out of room on each line.  I apologize for my error re. your bearing a grudge - I mistook the email for one you had written.  I'm afraid I still don't see an explicit criticism of the company here - the articles describe how Goldman Sachs contrived to make money on both sides of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, without condemning this.  From one perspective I see the criticism: they made money at the expense of other lenders.  From another perspective, this can be considered a positive: while many other firms were greatly harmed by the crisis, they succeeded in making large profits for their shareholders.  The material seems notable and should be included, but I just don't see how it is a criticism.  It seems value-neutral. [[User:Michaelbusch|Michaelbusch]] ([[User talk:Michaelbusch|talk]]) 20:46, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

::: OK, I think we will just have to agree to disagree on this. I see Allan Sloane's Washington Post article as being critical, as well as The Daily Record and SFGate.com. The FinFacts article is value-neutral but still verifies the approach - outlined by these first two sources - as to how GS increased revenues from subprime. However, I have no problems with your new title for this insert. [[User:Ivankinsman|Ivankinsman]] ([[User talk:Ivankinsman|talk]]) 07:56, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

While I do not agree with the recent criticism section at all (Where is the recent accolades section? What true purpose does this section serve? Can this section lead to subjective opinions on the part of the readers? What constitutes recent? Again, why only criticism and no accolades?), I think that I will leave the decision for it to stay up to more practiced wikipedians. The insider trading scandal that was previously listed at the bottom does not deserve its own section, and has been annotated and moved into the criticism section. Finally, of most importance is the entire section devoted to the 2007 mortgage crisis that Goldman seems to have averted. Let's start from the top: most of the first paragraph is a word-for-word plagiarized version of the San Francisco Chronicle article that it loosely references. This section: 
::"As chief of Goldman Sachs, Paulson was involved, to degrees as yet unrevealed, in the mortgage securitization process during the halcyon days of mortgage fraud from 2004 to 2006. Paulson became the U.S. Treasury secretary on July 10, 2006, after the extent of the debacle was coming into focus for those in the know. Goldman Sachs achieved recent accolades in the markets for having bet heavily against the housing market, while Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch and others got hammered for failing to time the end of the credit bubble. Goldman Sachs is the only major investment bank in the United States that has emerged as yet unscathed from this debacle. The success of its strategy must have resulted from fairly substantial bets against housing, mortgage banking and related industries, which also means that Goldman Sachs saw this coming at the same time they were bundling and selling these loans." 
should be in quotes, not just referencing the source that it was taken word-for-word from. Additionally, the Chronicle cannot be construed as a reputable source for these allegations, as it clearly states that, for instance, Paulson was involved ''to degrees yet unknown''. Does this mean that the degree could have been 0? Yes, it does. This brings me back to my original statement: undue criticism, especially of the kind that is unquantifiable ''and'' unqualified is absolutely inappropriate for this, a knowledge-disseminating wiki (not an opinion-disseminating one). Can we really use the word 'halcyon days of mortgage fraud' and believe that this is objective reporting? I am removing all items in this section that are complete plagiarism, and hope to spark a discussion that would remove ''undue, subjective criticism'' from all financial institution wikis. --[[User:Yuu.david|Yuu.david]] ([[User talk:Yuu.david|talk]]) 04:04, 21 January 2008 (UTC)

After reading it, I think the section should be eliminated. Most of it immaterial to the article and the company. It should not be a current events section, and the only things that should be included are those that are ""known"" to have had a material impact on the firm. I've quoted below the only part of the section I believe may be material.
:"In 1986, David Brown was convicted of passing inside information to Ivan Boesky on a takeover deal.[37] Robert Freeman, who was a senior Partner, the Head of Risk Arbitrage, and a protégé of Robert Rubin, was also convicted of insider trading, with his own account and with the firm's.[38]"

== Involvement with the bailout of AIG, Q1 2009 and December 2008 Results (new sections) ==

I've written a new section within 'Criticism and controversy' that clarifies (with references) the events surrounding AIG's bailout and its relation to Goldman Sachs. Unfortunately, this seems to be a common area of misinformation and misconception in public circles.

The previous sentence in the 'Criticism and controversy' section, which claimed that payments from the AIG bailout were 'chiefly responsible' for Goldman's profits in 2008 and Q1 2009, was highly non-NPOV and not based upon fact. It goes directly against official statements issued by the firm's CFO and other executives that: (1) their exposure to AIG was immaterial after hedges, and (2) any mark-to-market profits from their hedges were insignificant, and the hedges did not pay out because AIG was not allowed to fail.

I don't know if the new section is too long, but I think it's important that the facts are presented clearly and thoroughly given all the misinformation that's floating around (and often repeated). It is unfortunate that some of the public's anger may also be based upon this misinformation.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.111.8.99|131.111.8.99]] ([[User talk:131.111.8.99|talk]]) 05:56, 15 April 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: Also written a new section on Q1 2009 and December Financial Results. '''I should stress that I think this section is unnecessary.''' There was a lot of chatter and criticism in the 'blogosphere' about December losses, but to be honest most of the commentators didn't know what they were talking about or were trying to be sensationalist. Sometimes both. (Some that thought Goldman arbitrarily changed their fiscal year to exclude December losses, others simply didn't look at what happened in December - continued market deterioration, significant writedowns on credit, real-estate, $850m writedown from loans to bankrupt company LyondellBasell, etc)

: A particular Wikipedia contributor has insisted on reverting my edits that deleted his references to December, which were arguably non-neutral and had a decidedly negative slant on the firm (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goldman_Sachs&oldid=285293920#Criticism_and_Controversy revision 285293920] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goldman_Sachs&oldid=285377295#Criticism_and_Controversy 285377295]). Because of this, I decided to flesh the whole thing out and explain the matter fully and properly for the record. I do think the section is unnecessary, but if people insist on mentioning 'disappearing' losses in December it is better to have the full story rather than a misleadingly negative slant with 'conveniently' selective quotations from the media.

: Case in point - Morgan Stanley's earnings released on 22 April 2009. They also had a stub month of December, as they converted to a bank holding company too. However, their December losses were $1.3B vs $780M from Goldman. However, far less chatter in the blogosphere about it this time round... probably because they also missed earnings forecasts for their new January-March first quarter by a considerable margin. Obvious double standards in reporting. It was probably because Goldman's first quarter results were so much above street expectations (i.e., double), people just assumed it was because they 'piled' losses into December. Morgan Stanley's results show that this is not the case.

: Now, before some mentions the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP).... perhaps they should think about the other banks who have issued far more debt under this program than the $28bn issued by Goldman. Don't forget, banks have to pay fees to participate in TLGP.

While I personally think that Goldman did nothing wrong with AIG, I find myself concerned with the unsigned nature of these comments here.  Furry Goat's only Contribs have been to the Goldman page.

== Trimming criticism section (discuss) ==

I made a lot of revisions to this section, and in some cases removed what was either clear [[WP:OR|original research]] or just had no place in the article. I realize many people are angry at GS in this recessionary environment, but some of this section was just ridiculous and in some cases, misleading.  I removed the following (thoughts welcome):
*The current chief economic adviser to President Obama, [[Lawrence Summers]], was noted for receiving $5.2 million from hedge fund [[D.E. Shaw]] in 2008 and speaking fees (ranging from $45 thousand to $135 thousand per event) from banks including Goldman Sachs, [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Citigroup]], [[Lehman Brothers]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]<ref>"[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/04/03/summers_raked_in_speaking_fees.html Summers Raked in Speaking Fees from Wall Street]", [[Philip Rucker]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 3, 2009</ref> at a time when he was expected to become the most influential financial official in the U.S. Government.<ref name="sal">"[http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/04/04/summers/index.html Larry Summers, Tim Geithner and Wall Street's ownership of government]", [[Glenn Greenwald]], ''[[Salon.com]]'', April 4, 2009</ref>
::This has nothing to do with Goldman Sachs and shouldn't be in the article, as it wouldn't be notable for inclusion in any of the articles for banks the quote mentions. As the quote states, most banks hire officials to speak in their area of expertise honorarium/speaking fees.

*Former bank regulator [[William K. Black]], appearing on ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'' on April 3, 2009, accused the financial industry of massive fraud, citing the role [[Tim Geithner]] played before being promoted to Treasury Secretary as well as the successful efforts of [[Alan Greenspan]], former Goldman CEO [[Robert Rubin]] (Geithner's mentor) and [[Larry Summers]] in the late [[1990s]] to block regulation of  the financial derivatives market.<ref> "[http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04032009/transcript1.html Transcript]", ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'', April 3, 2009</ref> According to [[Brooksley Born]], former head of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], Summers, Rubin and Greenspan blocked her efforts to regulate the derivatives market, on the grounds that the financial industry was objecting.<ref> "[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2009/marapr/features/born.html Prophet and Loss]", Rick Schmitt, ''[[Stanford Magazine]]'', March/April, 2009</ref> Born was then succeeded as head of the  CFTC by former Goldman Sachs executive [[Gary Gensler]], who stated that he "should have done more to rein in exotic financial instruments that have battered global markets".<ref> "[http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE52G0BI20090317?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews Senate committee approves Gensler to head CFTC]", [[Christopher Doering]], ''[[Reuters]]'', March 16, 2009</ref>
::First of all, the Stanford source doesn't even mention Goldman Sachs. And actually states that Rubin "supported closer scrutiny of the derivatives market," but that he didn't think it was feasible at the time. Secondly, the sentence, "''William Black...accused the financial industry of massive fraud, citing the role [[Tim Geithner]] played before being promoted to Treasury Secretary...''" also has nothing to do with GS, as some have tried to remind many on this page, Geithner never worked for GS.

*In April 2009, Goldman's former in house counsel John Squires, who had moved to law firm [[Chadbourne & Parke]], sent a [[cease and desist]] letter to Michael Morgan founder of ''GoldmanSachs666.com'' for trademark violation.<ref>[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OXfTb7bGj14/Sdz-qBPf9lI/AAAAAAAAADA/uRwhI0sFiB4/s1600-h/GS_IMAGE.jpg]</ref> The site has published negative articles and conspiracy theories on the firm and their alleged involvement in the global financial crisis.<ref> "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/5137489/Goldman-Sachs-hires-law-firm-to-shut-bloggers-site.html Goldman Sachs hires law firm to shut blogger's site]", [[James Quinn]], ''[[Telegraph.co.uk]]'', April 11, 2009</ref>  Morgan sued Goldman Sachs.

::Is a common ceases and desist letter, to a blogger of all people, ''really'' notable for an international investment bank?  It's especially odd that it's in the "Criticism" section.

*In an interview in July 2009, former Assistant Secretary of Treasury Paul Craig Roberts was asked "Does the US Secretary of the Treasury work for the people or does he work for the banking system on Wall Street?" to which he replied, "He works for Goldman Sachs." <ref> "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcQJSFJKvy0#t=2m47s On the Edge with Max Keiser]", [[Press TV]], July 3, 2009</ref>
::This sentence was given an entire section entitled, "Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Treasury claims Treasury works for Goldman Sachs."  First I'd point out that we don't cite YouTube, and that this would constitute original research.  If anything, the quote would be more appropriate in the context of criticism of the Treasury Secretary/Department, but even there would be a stretch.

*Goldman Sachs expected in December 2008 to pay $14 million in taxes worldwide for 2008 compared with $6 billion in 2007. The company’s effective income tax rate dropped to 1 percent from 34.1 percent. According to Robert Willens, president and chief executive officer of tax and accounting advisory firm Robert Willens LLC: “Clearly they have taken steps to ensure that a lot of their income is earned in [[tax haven|lower-tax jurisdictions]].” <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=a6bQVsZS2_18|title= Bloomberg news: "Goldman Sachs’s Tax Rate Drops to 1%, or $14 Million"  |accessdate=2009-08-09 |date=2008-12-16}}</ref>
::I moved this to the "Corporate Affairs section. Again, simply stating this report in the criticism section (without the cited story actually criticizing it), is OR.  It's a useful fact though, hence my moving it rather than removing it.

*Goldman has played a major role in advising states on how to structure privatization deals—even while positioning itself to invest in the [[toll road]] market.  Conflicts of interest in such transactions are difficult to quantify.
::This one wasn't in the Criticism section. The source didn't cite anything that would lead one to conclude the firm was "positioning itself" to invest in the toll market.  Notwithstanding, I realize that Mother Jones magazine isn't exactly the pinnacle of financial reporting, but on every research report published by every U.S. investment bank, you will see a notice that states something along the lines of, "[Name of firm] does and seeks to do businesses with companies covered in its research reports.  As such investors should be aware of the inherent conflicts of interests...."  Often times, firms will take an equity stake in a private equity project they're advising on, to both participate in potential upside and to ease concerns of buyers or investors. The "even while positioning itself..." quote implies some form of illegal wrongdoing.

::if "nobody knows what bonuses" Goldman projects for this year, then its CEO should not have prematurely commented on public reaction to the anticipated bonuses.  In early Dec, NYT reported that Goldman set aside an avg. of $700k per employee in bonus pool.  I am sure 29-year-old bankers making a million in bonuses work real hard, but so does the guy who works at a gas station and just lost his home.  If the already vulnerable latter was punished for gambling, then "record" bonuses for the former is something "out of the ordinary". Unless Goldman has been receiving billions as a result of a bailout by the Fed "for decades, some centuries", this year's bonuses are something "out of the ordinary". Unless Goldman funded subprime mortgages "for decades, some centuries", this year's bonuses are something "out of the ordinary". and just because it has been going on "for decades, some centuries" does not mean, it should not receive special attention today.  I would take your point if it were a thing of the past.  I am spent, but in a bit, we can further discuss why I don't think the bonuses should be buried in the article and earn a well deserved section under "criticism and controversies".  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.84.35.181|67.84.35.181]] ([[User talk:67.84.35.181|talk]]) 11:22, 13 January 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:::The CEO only said that neither the public, nor the employees, will be happy.

You may want to take a look at [[WP:NEUTRALITY]] A company that has repaid government money with interest isn't subjected to any sort of compensation restrictions.

Unlike previous decades, this year there is a widespread and well-documented outrage over the anticipated bonuses, and this alone - criticism by the public, the press as well as government officials - warrants a separate section under controversies.  I said it will be comprehensive, but it doesn't have to be lengthy.  But that's not your main concern, is it?  As for neutrality, we can get a wiki editor who is not a Goldman lackey to mediate.  

The section on subprime mortgages does not discuss bonuses.  bonuses despite gambling, loosing and jeopardizing the entire economy only to be saved by the government is a separate issue.  And yes, many financial institutions were involved in it, but my resources are limited, and I can only adequately focus on one institution.  Someone else will have to examine the others.  

('''as an aside''', not only is Goldman not "subjected to any sort of compensation restrictions", but such restrictions would be redundant if the government's lawyers pay more attention to Goldman's dealings and work overtime on how to implement steep taxes on bonuses along with the TARP fees to offset the deficit.)

== Criticism additions ==

There's always a tendency for some users (usually new) to add to, or expand, criticism sections of company articles in order to list every detail from every news headline that mentions a company. Many times, this results in [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:UNDUE]], [[WP:RECENT]], and other violations. For example...
===10K press mention===
User:Georgeccampbell's addition of the section:
<blockquote>'''Public Relations Problems Threaten Viability'''<br>
Under pressure from a whithering (sic) torrent of negative press and government inquiries into its activities, including its role in the 2010 financial collapse in Greece, Goldman Sachs was forced to concede in a 10K filing on March 1, 2010 that negative publicity was a growing threat.</blockquote>

First of all, describing a routine 10K disclosure as, "threatening viability" is illogical. Viability is threatened when the feasibility of a company's business is in doubt. Second, "...was forced to concede..." is both inaccurate and not neutral. No one "forced" the company to list "bad press" as a risk, and it is not a "concession," which suggests the company first denied it. Third, the Greek financial mess is a ''crisis,'' not a "collapse," technically speaking. I could go on, but my overall point is that this isn't notable, and certainly not worth a paragraph. 

===Greece===
Regarding User:Leladax's addition of the following:
<blockquote>'''Hints of intentionally destabilizing the Greek market'''<br>
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called for a probe on Goldman Sachs after it allegedly first had deals to subsidize Greece debt but later betting against it for profit by stating "obviously using these instruments in a way that intentionally destabilizes a company or country is counterproductive."
</blockquote>

First, anytime the words "Hints of..." is used, there's probably a strong case to be made for why the content is inappropriate for Wikipedia. Ben Bernanke did in no way "call for a probe on Goldman Sachs."  The '''direct''' quote, from the source, is, "We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies and their derivatives arrangements with Greece." Anyone familiar with the Federal Reserve System knows that they "look into" financial transactions made by member banks every single day. Apart from monetary policy, that is one of the Fed's primary responsibilities. Leladax's edit also [[WP:SYNTHESIS|synthesis]] information to suit his or her point of view by taking Bernanke's response to a question Sen. Dodd posed (in [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704479404575087340941987002.html the source]) about '''institutions in general''', not Goldman Sachs, and attributing it to GS. As a side note, "after it allegedly first had deals to subsidize Greece debt but later betting against it for profit" makes no grammatical sense.

While it's obvious Goldman has been mentioned in news stories recently regarding services it provided to Greece, this article should avoid recentism and remain neutral, as nothing worth noting has occurred either way yet.—[[User:DMCer|<span style="color:#008000">'''DMCer'''</span>]][[User_talk:DMCer|<span style="color:#800000">™</span>]] 06:22, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

==Moving of SEC suit discussion towards top of page==
This is about the boldest thing I have even done on wikipedia, but it really makes sense to move the SEC fraud suit up where it's easily found as volume spiked through the roof upon its filing.  Tens of thousands of visitors are coming to this page to read about the suit in plain english, not to have to scour to find it.  When the visitation volume decreases, then I'll move the discussion back toward the end of the article.  Thank you for your indulgence. Bull Market 08:16, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

:Reverted. As stated in the edit summary, this is blatant [[WP:RECENT|recentism]]", and gives [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] to the mere fact of a single lawsuit being filed (over what, in terms of financial markets, is a paltry sum – $15 million in fees to Goldman, or $1 billion in losses to major investors). Wikipedia is not a daily newspaper, and should not be writing or rearranging articles to fit the "hot story" ''du jour''. [[User:Fat&amp;Happy|Fat&amp;Happy]] ([[User talk:Fat&amp;Happy|talk]]) 18:29, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

Fat&Happy:  Your argument is sound when you call this "recentism" and apply a Wikipedia standard with a reference.  Well done.   Your argument is absurd and nearly demonstrates willful blindness if you reduce the impact of the suit to just a 15 million dollar fee and a billion in losses.   Goldman investors lost 10 (ten) billion dollars in market capitalization the day the suit was filed, affecting 401K's and mutual fund results for main street investors who are seeking to read about the suit on Wikipedia.  8,000 extra visitors per day are not coming here to read about Mr. Goldman in the 1800's or how Goldman fared during the Great Depression.   Rather, they are looking for what Wikipedia is known for-- an easy to find, plain and simple explanation-- this time of the SEC case against Goldman and Goldman's defense.  This lawsuit is a top subject on Wall Street, plastered all over the news, heavily discussed in the banking world, stands to make the SEC look bold or bad, is seen by many as raising a question about the very integrity of Goldman (I am not  taking a side on this) and plainly driving people to the article (daily traffic is up 500% since the suit was announced).   Please don't narrowly define this issue without recognition of the broader context.  Thank you.Bull Market 06:12, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

:Speaking of the "broader context," if one considers the nearly 150-year history of the company, moving the suit to the top is about as "recentism" as it gets. I wouldn't call a clear listing of the suit in the table of contents akin to forcing users to "scour" for the information.—[[User:DMCer|<span style="color:#008000">'''DMCer'''</span>]][[User_talk:DMCer|<span style="color:#800000">™</span>]] 18:58, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

DMSer, of course it's recentism andI dont contest the reversion on that basis.  The dispute under discussion now here was related to what was additionally argued to suggest the topic was relatively unimportant when it is highly important based on the objective facts provided.Bull Market 06:33, 24 April 2010 (UTC)  

In furtherance of previous points, now with the criminal probe, the GS stock is down another 15 points, again affecting the 401K's and mutual funds of millions.  That's a lot of affect for what some here chalked up as "just a billion dollars". Bull Market 20:45, 1 May 2010 (UTC)

== Article structure terrible and unreadable---buries important information under a mountain of blather ==

This article is excessively verbose and wordy. It 'talks over the heads' of the average reader. Fellow editors, I contend that this article needs a complete structural overhaul for readability. It scores very poorly for readability.

I copied the text of the article and pasted it into Microsoft Word 2010, then did a spelling and grammar check with readability analysis. This article scored: 


'''Statistics:'''
* Words:                                    8490
*Characters:                               45041
*Paragraphs:                               345
*Sentences:                                295
*Sentences per paragraph:                  9.5
*Words per sentence:                       25.2
*Characters per word:                      5



'''Readability:''' 
*Passive sentences:              17%
*Flesch reading ease:           <big> ''32.5%''</big>
*Flesch-Kincaid grade level:     14.5

For comparison, I also copy/pasted the Wikipedia article for financial derivatives into Word. Although it is an extremely technical and complex subject matter, it scored 37.6% for Flesch reading ease. And it had many sentence fragments. 

The article, as currently structured, buries the most socially, culturally, financially, and factually ''relevant information under a pile of hodgepodge factoids.

'''My suggestions:''' 
Put the History section later in the article. History section should be in reverse order (most recent first) as that is more readable and promotes the overall readability and flow of the article. Additionally, the order of topics should be rearranged for readability and flow.   Rearrange Controversies section in order of most recent first. Add links or explanations of what various banking entities are and what legal and social ramifications they have: for example the bank holding company. What's the importance to finance, access to capital, access to government support, social importance? Add a section about "too big to fail" institutions. What does it mean for ownership, liabilities, and how does GS fit in socially, culturally, financially? Add a section about GS's increasing political profile. What are the political connections between Goldman Sachs and Washington DC politicians, think tanks, and influential news organizations?

'''As currently structured, this article reads like an excessively wordy, cagey, boring and garbled mish-mash. It isn't terribly informative, even if it contains many facts. This is because it is not readable. I hope not intentionally.'''

== Levin-Coburn Report moved ==

I moved the Levin-Coburn Report section into Controversies. Considering the segment's own wording, it certainly isn't worthy of its own section: "The report '''alleged''' that Goldman Sachs '''may have''' misled investors." The ambiguous wording clearly indicates these "assumptions" are not necessarily true. Until, as the segment also mentions, the report is considered by the DOJ and the insinuations graduate to established known facts, this is controversy. --[[User:SentientParadox|SentientParadox]] ([[User talk:SentientParadox|talk]]) 14:26, 29 April 2011 (UTC)

I must protest against the removal of this new section. Only a few of the people I mentioned are alumni- Mario Monti (Italys new, unelected Prime Minister), Otmar Issing and Peter Sutherland are listed as still being employed by Goldman Sachs in the source I referenced. What I was doing was not merely pointing out a list of alumni but demonstrating that Goldman Sachs affiliated leaders, economists and politicans are actively serving in very high positions (even as Prime Ministers) and that this is a source of controversy.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/113.39.129.209|113.39.129.209]] ([[User talk:113.39.129.209|talk]]) 08:45, 20 November 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Should there be a mention of the Timberwolf deal anywhere - including an entry on the Timberwolf disambiguation page? ==

I suggest that the Timberwolf deal gets a mention due to both the controversy surrounding it (congressional hearings, allegations of misleading and betting against clients etc.) as well as the lawsuits filed in its wake. There's a pretty long article on Huffington Post on the subject which include a copy of the lawsuit.[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/28/basis-yield-alpha-fund-sues-goldman-sachs_n_1063762.html] If included, I would also suggest adding an entry along the line of [[Timberwolf (Goldman Sachs)]] on the [[Timberwolf]] disambiguation page redirecting to the section.

::::::::::::Yeah, good luck with that.
::::::::::::Of course, since the Goldman donation represents a matching gifts program based on employee donations, you need to have Wikimedia reject the base donations too; after all, they carry the same taint. So that's $600 for you and each of your imaginary partners. For one year.
::::::::::::But wait! Look at some of the other evil corporate giants on the list. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] is in the same category as Goldman. So double your amount to $1,200. Then you have [[Microsoft]] and [[Google]]. They're both in the top tier of over $50,000. Be conservative; figure $60,000 each, again plus the original employees amounts. So each of you needs to kick in at least $3,600 to keep Wikimedia to your standards of "purity" for one year. Have fun running your fundraising campaign.

In fact, according to [[WP:Primary]] (which seems to have had a major edit be aware), but according to the current text which seems pretty much as it has been, primary sources may be used in Wikipedia so long as they meet standards, 

"Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. A primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements of facts that can be verified by any educated person with access to the primary source but without further, specialized knowledge."

That says that, the source in its proposed format (albeit there is a spelling error in donor/donors), is valid, '''except''', it is that G/Sachs are a "''patron''"!  Not a major contributor.  

As for notability, household names do not need detailed notability.  The connection between the subjects does, but the connection is obviously there.  The fact that a subject has been published in multiple reliable sources is the exact evidence WP requires for their notability, and we don't really need to ask if WMF or WP has been published, because if we do not know that it has, we should.

It's a minor addition.  I am going to go ahead and insist it is a case of [[WP:SNOWBALL]] to keep it off the article.  If anyone has anything which shows doubt to what I have said, go ahead and revert me again and add to the discussion.  If anyone is offended, I have not even read the discussion (''edit: not read the '''whole''' discussion, of course I had a look through it before I decided I knew what it was about, sorry about that'').  It's definitely a valid item for a primary source.  The subject is definitely notable.  I found my way here from ANI.  I have no issue of bias.  Again, if you think I am in error, revert, go on with your discussion, cheers.  <font color="green" size="2" face="Impact">~ [[User:RTG|R]].[[User_Talk:RTG|T]].[[Special:Contributions/RTG|G]]</font> 02:03, 13 November 2014 (UTC)

::I removed it as [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. Wikimedia Foundation has many far larger donors. Goldman Sachs makes far larger donations to other charities. This is a cherry-picked factoid intended to make a point. A donation of $50,000 a year by a company with assets of almost a trillion dollars is insignificant.

:::I just read anough of it to get the gist and further down said you were all going totally off topic, but I've read it all now.  It is about primary and notability.  The donation is 15th on the list.  I believe that WP gets hundreds of thousands if not millions of donations.  I was wondering if the reffed page was an editable wiki page which would preclude it from being a resource, but it's not.  I don't see the point it is making except the point that they are a WP donator.  In fact, according to the info we have at hand, that donation could be G/Sachs most significant charitable donation ever.  I prefer inclusion of information so long as it doesn't get out of hand.  Maybe if they get good press they'll donate more too.

:::Here's another idea though... because when I went to read it, I was looking through the article sure I'd find a suitable section and didn't, but couldn't it go in the see also section? See also list of WMF benefactors?

::::Nope. There's no reliable secondary source connecting the two, so it belongs nowhere in the article.

:::::According to [http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/dealbook/2013/10/26/goldman-sachs-buying-redemption/?referrer= this ''New York Times'' article], Goldman Sachs has donated $1.6 billion to charity since 2008. Their $50,000 donations to the Wikimedia Foundation are chump change, and mentioning them gives undue weight to a triviality.

::::::Have to agree with Cullen328 et al here. In the absence of secondary sourcing establishing this as significant to Goldman Sachs, it's clearly undue weight to mention it in this article. Even if we look at the primary sources, it doesn't sound like there's any significance to Goldman Sachs since it's a tiny donation compare to the amounts they donate every year. Remember, we should treat the WMF (and wikipedia) the same we do everything else of comparable significance in the world. Note also that this is the Goldman Sachs article, so any significance to the WMF shouldn't be discussed here. If you believe this is significant to the WMF, you should be discussing adding it to the article on the WMF. (I don't see why it would be significant, 15th may seem high, but actually adding 15 donors to a general article seems way too many. But again that's best discussed elsewhere.)

==Assessment comment==
{{Substituted comment|length=494|lastedit=20090629161032|comment=I moved the assessment up to B class, but there is still a fair amount of POV left over, mostly in the one pararaph says some nice stuff about the company ignoring the cited material from elsewhere kind of thing. The sing song where the criticism is mostly separated out probably isn't good for NPOV. Also a lot of the references are to blogs, and need to be replaced by reliable references. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] <sup><small>[[User talk:Taxman|Talk]]</small></sup> 16:10, 29 June 2009 (UTC)}}

I was surprised to learn that 13,000 of GS's 35,000 employees are vice presidents.[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/goldman-aleynikov-fee-fight-turns-on-wall-street-vp-inflation] If we had a Trivia section I'd put it in there.
