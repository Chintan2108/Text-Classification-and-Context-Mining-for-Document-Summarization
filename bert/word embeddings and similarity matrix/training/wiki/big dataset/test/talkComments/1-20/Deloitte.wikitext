== Criticism EDD ==

The whole section is a bit much and reminds me of those complaint sites, but the EDD about a one time delayed payment falls under not notable one time events. There are alternative outlets outside of Wikipedia to air grievances.--[[User:WatchingContent|WatchingContent]] ([[User talk:WatchingContent|talk]]) 19:17, 28 March 2017 (UTC)

:I agree. The whole thing looks like a giant scarlet letter. [[User:Superkatlover|Superkatlover]] ([[User talk:Superkatlover|talk]]) 21:38, 9 November 2017 (UTC)

:I'm unsure what an "EDD" is in this context, but there's nothing in the article anymore about a delayed payment. The remaining cases in this section seem to be [[WP:GNG|notable]] and should be kept. [[User:Zazpot|Zazpot]] ([[User talk:Zazpot|talk]]) 21:45, 9 November 2017 (UTC)

==Cherry-picking negative information==
I am in the process of vetting the "Controversy" section and have discovered that large amounts of the information and negative sources have been cherry-picked to make Deloitte look bad. I am adding a warning tag, as this is going to take a long time to clean up. [[User:Superkatlover|Superkatlover]] ([[User talk:Superkatlover|talk]]) 22:06, 9 November 2017 (UTC)
: No drive by tagging please. If you think you can improve the section then please do so rather than leaving it to others. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 23:33, 9 November 2017 (UTC)
::I am actually working very hard to correct the bias by removing bad sources and finding good ones. It is slow going as I am not experienced at this.   [[User:Superkatlover|Superkatlover]] ([[User talk:Superkatlover|talk]]) 07:05, 10 November 2017 (UTC)
:"{{tq|large amounts of the information and negative sources have been ''cherry-picked to make Deloitte look bad''}}" - that's quite a brazen assertion. Please remember to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]]. [[User:Zazpot|Zazpot]] ([[User talk:Zazpot|talk]]) 12:33, 10 November 2017 (UTC)

== Proposed merge with [[GovLab]] ==

not notable enough for a separate article '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 23:07, 6 March 2018 (UTC)
:'''Support''' merge. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 23:17, 6 March 2018 (UTC)
:: In the absense of any objections I have merged the more notable material into this article.[[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 19:00, 9 March 2018 (UTC)
