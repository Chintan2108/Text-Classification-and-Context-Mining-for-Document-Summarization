There's probably lots of these that could be used (probably as a source rather than external link). - [[User:Samsara|{{{2|Samsara}}}]] ([[User talk:Samsara|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Samsara|contribs]]) 23:46, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

I added a link to [http://slashgeo.org slashgeo.org]. I don't consider this link spamming since it is an ad-free community-driven website specifically for remote sensing and geospatial technologies. If you disagree, simply [mailto:alexandre.leroux@ec.gc.ca email me] to discuss the issue.

With the addition of nacelles, the U2 became known as the TR-1.[[User:Radical man 7|Radical man 7]] 17:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
The latest edits are based on actual usage of the following Imagery Analysis roles; tasking, Air force OJT development of film media, production of photo mosaics to include the actual production of images, photogrammetry, and exposure to different aerial platforms to include UAV's and open-source material.[[User:Radical man 7|Radical man 7]] 17:33, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

sir i am going to do ph.d programme in remote sensing and i have to sent paragragh comprising of 1500 words about this.so i need you to sent me[[Special:Contributions/117.199.140.255|117.199.140.255]] ([[User talk:117.199.140.255|talk]]) 08:19, 29 December 2009 (UTC)

== civil war?? ==

Section history: "The first tactical use was during the civil war". Wich civil war are you talking? American civil war? Paris civil war? 
The information is incomplete!!

== Thermal remote sensing? ==

LANDSAT-TM, ASTER, MODIS and more sensors have thermal sensors to termine the land surface temperature or sea surface temperature. Please mention this in the article. [[User:Bumbulski|Bumbulski]] ([[User talk:Bumbulski|talk]]) 23:10, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Here a list for operational satellites with thermal sensors:
* Geostationary satellites: [[Meteosat]] and [[GOES]]
* Polar orbiting satellites:
** Medium resolution: NOAA [[AVHRR]], Terra/Aster [[MODIS]]
** High resolution: [[LANDSAT]] TM5 & ETM+ and Terra [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]]  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Bumbulski|Bumbulski]] ([[User talk:Bumbulski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bumbulski|contribs]]) 17:39, 4 August 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Article is too technical ==

I am not part of the in-crowd, and I am still confused. Is this article about geology? Just guessing here. Perhaps a higher-level overview in the beginning of the article would be helpful... [[User:Selerian|Selerian]] ([[User talk:Selerian|talk]]) 14:00, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

:It is about remote sensing - there are a fairly wideranging spread of sciences which would use the data collected. It is not too technical although it is possible that the lead is not properly explanatory for your purposes. I will reread it and examine how it may be improved

== Wording ==

"Examples of passive remote sensors include film photography, (?) infrared (?), charge-coupled devices, and radiometers"  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/188.223.72.236|188.223.72.236]] ([[User talk:188.223.72.236|talk]]) 15:25, 21 May 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->


== T & E ==

Regarding the several Special Interest Groups on the topic, e.g. [http://www.earsel.org/SIG/ET/index.php EARSeL SIG Training and Education] and the ongoing debate abput a sustainable integration of remote sensing data and methods, I added a chapter dealing with training and education. Any improvement suggestions? --[[User:Arienow|Arienow]] ([[User talk:Arienow|talk]]) 14:08, 20 September 2012 (UTC)
