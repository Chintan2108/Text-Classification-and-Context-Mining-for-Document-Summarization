== Date of Founding ==

The claim that JPMorgan Chase is one of the oldest financial services firms in the world is certainly a dubious one. I have just looked up a few banks in the UK and found that the majority of them predate JPMorgan Chase, some by over 100 years - and this is in the UK alone! Surely this claim can only be attributed to the banks in the US (the paragraph below, posted by Desertroguex, serves to reinforce this).--[[User:Jon2harman|Jon2harman]] 00:28, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

Technically, Manhattan bank (founded in 1799) is no longer the oldest heritage bank. JP has acquired Bank of New York's branches. BONY was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton. This also technically makes JPMC the nations oldest bank.--[[User:Desertroguex|Desertroguex]] 03:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Here are the sources I used for the Uruguay Banking Crisis section. Please note that these links actually work and they are derived from articles written in English, unlike the links above. The predominant view is that the banks had difficulty in managing the risk of the developing countries and dealing with the corrupt Rohm brothers during the financial crisis. The Central Bank of Uruguay is also largely to blame for not having adequate banking regulations and for the corruption among officials, part of the reason Uruguay became so popular in the first place.

----
I'm not going to mark this as POV yet, I don't think doing so without giving Wikipedia Updater a chance to explain his/her reasons would be fair. The problem is that the version posted now is straight out of JP Morgan's lawyers'. Dissecting the article:

"Uruguay Banking Crisis"
The title itself is misleading, there was never a banking crisis in Uruguay, as many other banks were able to live through the Argentine Banking Crisis without problems, it was those that were mismanaged and looted that ended up broke due to the rush on banks.

"In 1990, Chemical Overseas Holdings, Inc. (a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) acquired with Dresdner Bank Lateinamerika and Credit Suisse First Boston the Banco Comercial del Uruguay (BCU), one of that country's oldest and largest national banks."
This is the legal ruse that JPMCC is using in order to divert the case away from itself, it is clear to all involved (including courts in two countries), that it was JPMCC that acquired the bank, shielding itself through a fraudulent subsidiary. This is evident in the fact that the signatories to acquirement documents were JPMCC directors, and not those of Chemical Overseas.

"The consortium was headed by the brothers Carlos and José Rohm, two of Argentina’s most powerful financiers."
The consortium was actually headed by JPMCC & Credit Suisse appointees, with the Rohm brothers acting on their behalf. This is evident in all documents, including those presented by Carlos Rohm & the Uruguayan government.

"As the years progressed, Uruguay developed as a large offshore banking center for Argentina and Brazil, largely as a result of its lax banking laws and the predominant view among Argentineans that Uruguay was a stable place for their savings."
This is completely incorrect, as Uruguay has been an offshore banking center (not only for Argentina and Brazil), since well before 1990. It is JPMCC's attempt to show itself in a positive light. The predominant view that Uruguay was a safe place came from France , Spain, Italy & Germany, who's banks have long held close ties to Uruguay's; it was this fact that originally prompted argentinean immigrants (mainly from those four countries) to deposit their savings in Uruguay.

"In 2002, Uruguay suffered a massive banking crisis caused by a considerable contraction in the economy and by over-dependence on neighboring Argentina, which experienced an economic meltdown itself in 2001. A rush on banks ensued during the devaluation in Argentina, and the BCU was not able to handle the large loss of funds and began to clamor for government aid."
I repeat, there was never a banking crisis in Uruguay, merely a run on banks. Those which had funds equal to their statements were able to survive. Those which practiced creative accounting in their government statements did not, simple.

"As a result of the crisis and the fraudulent schemes conducted by the Rohm brothers, some $800 million USD of assets were missing from the BCU alone. In the end, five financial institutions failed and hundreds of thousands in Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil were left in dire economic conditions after seeing their bank accounts literally disappear."
While not innocent puppets in the scheme, the Rohm brothers did not have power over the bank (stipulated in the contracts), they simply oversaw the actions directed by JPMCC & Credit Suisse.

"According to many sources, the banking crisis could have been avoided if Uruguayan authorities had properly regulated its banks. The Central Bank in Uruguay had trusted international banks to regulate themselves properly and was too lenient and slow in responding to the crisis."
This statement is philosophical. "Trust", "properly", "lenient", "slow"; these are all words of opinion, not fact. The Uruguayan regulations have been standing for hundreds of years with nary a problem, JPMCC simply took advantage of the system and used it for their own benefits.

"In January 2005, the Paris-based International Arbitration Court ruled that the Uruguayan government would have to pay $120 million USD to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Dresdner Bank AG, and Credit Suisse First Boston for failing to maintain the solvency of the BCU."
This statement simplifies the entire ordeal, and is used by JPMCC as marketing fodder to confuse those who do not have the full facts. Part of the original contract called for Uruguay to aid the bank with up to $110 million in funds to mantain solvency, however, the government refused to do so when they discovered the entire scheme, because it would have simply gone through the JPMCC network and never made it to the account holders. Instead, the government closed the bank to stop the growing debt Banco Comercial had. The ruling simply reflected what was written in the original contract, not, as JPMCC is trumpeting, the government's fault in the scandal.

"The Rohm brothers, whose fraudulent activities included granting loans to ghost companies and concealing complex financial movements, are also largely to blame. Carlos Rohm is currently in prison in Argentina for using $250 million in credit instruments from BCU and diverting them to a trust account in Argentina. José Rohm is understood to be at large in the U.S., and his extradition is being sought by Uruguay."
Ghost companies created by JPMCC and complex movements involving JPMCC subsidiaries. Once again, the Rohms are guilty to a degree, but they were not the masterminds behind the operation.

"The crisis underscores the three banks’ difficulty in managing risk in developing countries and dealing with local partners during a time of financial crisis. As a result, many of BCU's former clients are suing the three international banks and their chief executives."
Correct.

----

I don't think anyone disagress that the Banco Comercial del Uruguay (BCU) was mismanaged, but the notion that the three international banks were perpetrators of a fraud is false. There is absolutely no evidence that the BCU's investor banks had any direct connection with the fraud committed by the Rohm Brothers. JPMorgan Chase, Dresdner Bank, and Credit Suisse First Boston lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the crises that occured in Argentina and Uruguay. 

Any accusations of fraud must be supported by direct evidence and are frankly not appropriate in the context of an impartial encyclopedia. Both the Rohm Brothers were convicted on fraud charges. The BCU's investor banks were not. Statements such as "JPMCC created ghost corporations" are misleading and are based on the writer's opinion, not fact. Reliable sources from the links above indicate that the extent of the three banks' liability is their difficulty in managing the risk of developing countries and in controlling the Rohm Brothers during the financial crises. That is acceptable. On the other hand, to indicate that the BCU's investors purposefully sought to defraud their clients during a time of crisis and to steal their deposits is absurd and is unacceptable. Again, there is absolutely no evidence of this, whatsoever. If you disagree, please provide English language links from reliable publications that show the contrary.

Around the world, banks lend out deposits and typically only keep a percentage of deposits on hand for customers to redeem. Even if a bank does have funds equal to its statements, it will not survive a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run Bank run]. The crisis in Uruguay was exacerabted by the fact that the Central Bank of Uruguay did not have adequate banking regulations and capital controls. Had the Central Bank instituted proper controls, the bank may have been able to maintain its solvency during the crisis. Please see the article "Banking reform will reinforce recovery" above. Uruguay was not in compliance with the Basel Capital Accords during the crisis, which are a formulation of best banking practices by the G-10 countries. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation Bank regulation].

There is no notion whatsoever about the '''three''' international banks being involved in the fraud. As stated in the original article: by contract, the Rohm brothers did not have full executory powers over the bank, there was oversight from the majority partners (JPMC), this is evident in all documentation available on the subject (mostly in spanish, as the english-speaking press has not payed much attention to this). As a side note to this, I fail to see how english-language sources are more ''reliable'' in comparison to their spanish counterparts, information in languages other than english is just as relevant, and I resent the implication.

Who has been convicted or not is irrelevant, since the Uruguayan and Argentine courts have no jurisdiction over JPMC and, due to this, there is a current case in New York courts (as shown in the links) dealing with this matter. JPMC's argument that the case is baseless due to the reasons Wikipedia Updater states has been continously thrown out by the case judge, due simply to the fact that there '''is''' enough evidence connecting JPMC to the fraud to continue the case. I fail to understand why the fervor to protect JPMC, the facts are simple, there is evidence and that evidence is being used in court; JPMC's and Wikipedia Updater's arguments of lack of evidence are incorrect, as stated by judges in three nations.

I am not trying to imply anything about how JPMC sought to "defraud their clients during a time of crisis"; the fraud was existent way before the crisis. As stated in the original article: the crisis only served to bring the fraud to light. The fact stands that there was malfeasense between the Rohm brothers and JPMC against the bank and its clients, at all times, not only during the crisis. The fact that they took advantage of lax banking laws is merely a sidenote to this, not a justification.

There are complex calculations and systems in place to ensure a bank's solidity in troubled times, but these all grow from the bank's statements, if those are inflated, then the controls and government insurance are worthless, since they are created upon a fantasy. It may seem counter-intuitive, but a bank that overstates its earnings and positions is actually more at risk than one that understates them, it is not a direct system where, for example, for every $1.00 in the bank, $0.80 is safeguarded. This is one of the main reasons why the BCU folded so quickly; the network of loans and false markets created inflated the bank's value to a point that client accounts were a tiny drop in the alleged coffers, hence the lack of liquidity and impossibility of quick action when the run ensued. Other banks in Uruguay (national and international) were able to survive the run and continue to operate today, under Wikipedia Updater's assumption, those banks should not exist, since they were part of the same system.

You cannot simply distill facts into broad statements and then work backwards to reconstruct them. Facts must be taken at face value and not as optional ingredients. Personal opinion about a company and its behavior cannot enter into what is supposedly a collection of facts.

The sources I cited are 1)New York Court public records; 2)A German non-profit organization; 3)Finanzas.com, a spanish-language economics analysis and news center (similar to Forbes); 3)Espectador, Uruguay's most respected news radio. I fail to see how these are not reliable sources.

Hdezela, I am having trouble evaluating your sources. The New York State Court link that you provided above does not show actual court documents, it only shows the case name, "NETWORK FINANCE v. J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO," the names of the law firms, the judge and the case calendar. Please provide a better link or instructions on how to access the actual court documents, so I can ascertain the facts of the case to respond to your arguments.

Also, I do not speak German or Spanish. This is an English language encyclopedia, and it is only appropriate that you provide sources in English, so everyone reading the encyclopedia can evaluate them for objectivity and relevance.

When you provide these sources, I will take the time to review them and respond to your comments, but I would like to mention that '''five''' of Uruguay's 22 financial institutions collapsed (including those that had no affiliation to the Rohm Brothers). This fact is significant because it shows that there were serious and substantial problems with the regulatory environment in Uruguay. The fraud and resulting insolvency at the BCU is by no means an isolated problem. Weaker banks that conducted their operations legally were equally affected by the crisis.

Wikipedia should not be a forum for advancing your viewpoints or mine. Please provide me with better source material, so I can directly respond to your arguments and so we can resolve this matter and return the article back to an objective summary of the organization for the benefit of Wikipedia's audience. Thank you.

The article appears to use J. P. Morgan & Company (abbr. J. P. Morgan) for the Firm's name. That is cool, and I encourage all contributors to follow in that convention. The alternative (accepted) names for the Company are JPMorgan, J.P. Morgan, JPM, but please don't use these. Colloquially, you see JP a lot too. [[User:Iav|Ilya]] 16:40, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Usages within the bank (at least the investment bank)
 - Pre-2000: J.P. Morgan OR Morgan, never JPM
 - Post-2000: J.P. Morgan in legal names, JPMorgan in text, JPM not encouraged (though internal use has grown)
Certainly 'JP Morgan' is completely unacceptable
My view is that JPMorgan should be used in the bulk of the text OR JPMorganChase when referring to the HoldCo.
Also think this article maybe needs a separate section on the retail Chase Bank given its importance in US Retail

== Chase Acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co REDUX ==

The sentence "By the late 1990s, when it was acquired by Chase Manhattan (the new company's name became JPMorgan Chase & Co.)." is one of the most unusual I have seen.  The main sentence, i.e., subject and verb, are included parenthetically, almost incidentally, and the adverbial dependent clause is made to look like the independent, main clause.

I am not sure I understand exactly what is meant, but the simplest treatment is:

“When Chase Manhattan acquired J. P. Morgan in the late 1990s, the new company's name became JPMorgan Chase & Co.)."

== Flagicon in infobox ==

In the past I have removed the United States flagicon used in the infobox per [[WP:ICONDECORATION]].  The flagicon is being used in the infobox to decorate since there is a link to United States listed after the flagicon, therefore the flagicon adds no encyclopedia value to the article.  It has been reverted on the basis that the"flag icon is permissible per WP:MOS and does not qualify as purely for decoration per WP:ICONDECORATION."  So I am starting a discussion here to gain a consensus and let the other editor explain how it is permissible per [[WP:MOSICON]] and how the flagicon is not used for decoration. [[User:Aspects|Aspects]] ([[User talk:Aspects|talk]]) 19:12, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:With no response to my discussion for over a month, I am going to remove the flagicon with an edit summary to see the discussion here. [[User:Aspects|Aspects]] ([[User talk:Aspects|talk]]) 00:32, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

* This issue has been discussed previously.  The [[WP:MOS]] does not restrict the usage of flag icons in infoboxes.  Furthermore, this is common practice in company infoboxes throughout wikipeda and should be retained here. As proposed previously, this issue should be settled elsewhere in a more definitive fashin where concerned editors can discuss the removal of flag icons from infoboxes before doing so in this article. <font color="#3950A5" size="1">|►</font> [[User:Urbanrenewal|<font color="#000070"><b>ϋrбan</b></font><font color="#4D4D4D">яeneωaℓ</font>]] • [[User:Urbanrenewal/talk|<font size="0" color="#BFA137">TALK</font>]] <font color="#3950A5" size="1">◄|</font> 05:41, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

::[[WP:MOSICON]] does restrict the use of decorative flagicons per [[WP:ICONDECORATION]].  There is already a link to United States in the infobox, so the flagicon adds no encyclopedic information.  Common practice in company infoboxes would actually work against you in this case, since most companies do not have flagicons in their infoboxes. [[User:Aspects|Aspects]] ([[User talk:Aspects|talk]]) 00:40, 28 August 2009 (UTC)

:::It is unnecessary and should be removed from company infoboxes, not just this one.  A ''singular'' flag icon draws [[WP:undue weight]] to that specific field in the infobox, and serves no navigational function (unlike flag icon usage for browsing a vertical list or table, for example).  There are many, many, types of infoboxes in which a "country of origin" field is typically marked with a flag icon, but that doesn't make it a good thing.  All those instances ought to be removed.  — [[User:Andrwsc|Andrwsc]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Andrwsc|talk]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Andrwsc|contribs]]) 19:56, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

:::: I agree with Andrwsc that the icon does not serve an encyclopedic purpose and should be removed here and in similar infoboxes. Here I would go further and remove both the icon and the text (''i.e.,'' "<code><del><nowiki>{{flagicon|USA}} </nowiki></del><nowiki>[[New York City]]</nowiki><del><nowiki>, [[United States|USA]]</nowiki></del></code>") as the typical reader can be expected to know that New York City is in the USA, and saying "USA" (with a wiklink!) is just useless clutter in this context.

Please note that the editors here are part of a small group of editors who actively remove flag icons.  The apparent consensus is really just the same small group moving from article to article.

== Market Capitalization ==

The wiki pages for JPMChase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo say that each is the US banking institution with the second largest market capitalization.  My understanding is that at least 2 of these must be wrong!
According to 
http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:JPM
the respective Mkt Cap are:

JPM 174B

BA  120B

C   121B

WFC 152B

Worried I may have misunderstood something here ... so updating the talk page rather than directly editing the 3 pages.  Citigroup and Bank of America are so close they may swap places very quickly on tiny price movements ... all 4 definitely have been swapping places in the last 2 years ... ( Well, technically Wells Fargo does not need to be updated, because it does seem to be the US bank with the second largest capitalization. )  Seem sensible to me to update JPM and WFC to say the largest and second largest respectively, and describe Citigroup and BA as something like one of the 4 largest US banks by market capitalization.

== Fined for what exactly... ==

The discussion of the London Whale case says JPMorgan lost billions of dollars from making bad bets on the market.  They were also fined nearly another billion dollars and admitted to violating securities law.  However, the section as it stands does very little to explain what law(s) were broken.  There is nothing directly illegal about losing a lot of money, so I assume it was associated side problem.  For example, they could have violated reporting requirements by not properly disclosing their positions and the losses involved.  Or they could have concealed some problem satisfying margin or capital requirements as a result of the losses.  Or they could have failed to have legally required safeguards in place.  Or it could be some combination of things.  Obviously taking billion dollar losses is a huge problem for the people involved, but the article should do a better job of explaining why it was also a criminal problem leading to large fines on top of the already large loss.
