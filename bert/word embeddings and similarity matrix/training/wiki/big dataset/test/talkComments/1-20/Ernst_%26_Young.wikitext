[[:Ernst & Young]] → {{no redirect|EY (company)}} – Three years ago Ernst & Young changed its name to EY. EY was a nickname for Ernst & Young for many years and now it's the official name so the article name needs to reflect that.

:'''Oppose'''. This was considered in 2013 (see archives) and the decision was '''not moved'''. Also according to its [http://www.ey.com/uk/en/newsroom/facts-and-figures website] the official name is still Ernst & Young. In any case Ernst & Young is not a company. [[User:Dormskirk|Dormskirk]] ([[User talk:Dormskirk|talk]]) 21:13, 4 December 2016 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per [[WP:COMMONNAME]], which to the wider world is still Ernst & Young. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 15:42, 5 December 2016 (UTC)

== Hellas addition ==

This inclusion was a part of a larger personal attack on Nikesh Arora. That entry has been restored but seems the attack editor included it on a couple of more articles. I will revert here and those also.--[[User:WatchingContent|WatchingContent]] ([[User talk:WatchingContent|talk]]) 16:31, 29 March 2017 (UTC)
