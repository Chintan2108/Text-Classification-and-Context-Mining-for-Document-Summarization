[[Movie studio]] → {{no redirect|1=Film studio}} – "Film" is the preferred term over "movie" throughout Wikipedia, and this article should also reflect this. --[[User:Robsinden|Rob Sinden]] ([[User talk:Robsinden|talk]]) 12:55, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' movie studio is more commonly used.  No indication has been given that it isn't in the nomination.  <span style="background:#66EE88">'''[[User talk:Hot Stop|<span style="font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">Hot Stop</span></span>]]'''</span> 14:00, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
::It would be in line with nearly all film production articles including [[major film studio]].  --[[User:Robsinden|Rob Sinden]] ([[User talk:Robsinden|talk]]) 14:29, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
:::I should add that "movie studio is more commonly used" is entirely dependent on where in the world you live! - [[User: Schrodinger's cat is alive | SchroCat]] ([[User talk: Schrodinger's cat is alive #top |<font face="Webdings"><big>^</big></font>]] • [[Special:Contributions/ Schrodinger's cat is alive |<font face="Webdings"><big>@</big></font>]]) 18:18, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' The naming convention for film articles has been agreed as Film Title (film) not Film Title (movie) for about seven years and there's no reason why this shouldn't follow suit. Other aspects of Wiki also use "film", rather than "movie" so we have MOS:FILM, WikiProject Film etc, as well as more general industry usage (AFI, BFI etc) - [[User: Schrodinger's cat is alive | SchroCat]] ([[User talk: Schrodinger's cat is alive #top |<font face="Webdings"><big>^</big></font>]] • [[Special:Contributions/ Schrodinger's cat is alive |<font face="Webdings"><big>@</big></font>]]) 15:20, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' per [[WP:MOSFILM]] for film over movie. '''[[User:Lugnuts|<font color="002bb8">Lugnuts</font>]]''' ([[User talk:Lugnuts|talk]]) 18:12, 28 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' – As per [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. Google returns a higher hit rate for "movie studio" ([http://www.google.com/search?&q=%22movie+studio%22 9.4 million])as opposed to "film studio" ([http://www.google.com/search?&q=%22film+studio%22 6 million]); however Google books favors "film studio" ([http://www.google.com/search?q=%22film+studio%22&tbm=bks 238,000] to [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22movie+studio%22&tbm=bks 87,000]) and likewise Google scholar ([http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22film+studio%22 8,900] as opposed to [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22movie+studio%22 6,000]). On the basis of that, the more authoritative usage—in terms of what would qualify as reliable sources—favors "film studio".
