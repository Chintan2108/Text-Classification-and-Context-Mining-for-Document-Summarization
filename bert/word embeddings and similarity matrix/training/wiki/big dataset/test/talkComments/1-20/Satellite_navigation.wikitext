==merge and redirect==

I think this article should be merged with [[satellite navigation systems]], and redirected there.  Any objections?  --[[User:Michaelfavor|Michaelfavor]] 16:10, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

:FYI, [[de:Satellitennavigation]] merged the opposite direction. I tend to agree with a merger, but I think GNSS (This article) is probably the more important article name. --[[User:Dual Freq|Dual Freq]] 16:19, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

GNSS is the accepted generic term for GPS and its peers. The taxonomy is as follows:

*SNS
**GNSS
***GPS
***Glonass
***Galileo, etc....

It is OK to keep SNS as an overview article that covers the history up to GPS. - <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:70.198.253.77|70.198.253.77]] ([[User talk:70.198.253.77|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.198.253.77|contribs]]) 17:42, 8 December 2006</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

:While GNSS definately appears to be the correct generic term to describe GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, etc. I'm not sure I understand what a GNSS article would contribute that isn't already in the SNS article?

::GNSS should be the main article since, this is the accepted term. It should have all the generic info from GPS and SNS.

Since the articles are now merged, with GNSS inheriting the content, I've copied over the SNS discussion topics.

===DGPS===
DGPS only "eliminates the military advantage" as long as your DGPS transmitters are usable. DGPS transmitters can be either:
* large and hard to jam, but easy to destroy
* small, numerous, and difficult to destroy, but easy to jam

===Japanese DGPS===
It's not accurate to say that "Some Japanese" started transmitting DGPS data and implying that this was some sort of hack, without mentioning all of the other parties (and governments) that also broadcast DGPS signals.

===SA===

''The military resisted for most of the 1990s, but SA was eventually turned off in 1999.''

Selective Availability was officially activated on Mar. 25, 1990 then deactivated on May 2, 2000.  These dates are according to 'Introduction to GPS - the Global Positioning System' by Ahmed El-Rabbany 2nd Ed. pp. 45-46.  El-Rabbany gives a citation for each date:

===Merger===
It's TOTALLY WRONG to remove the GNSS link and link this to “Satellite navigation system” as the main term for this page is GNSS, which will replace the term “GPS” in long terms anyway. GPS is out and GNSS is in as most receivers will be GNSS (Global Satellite Navigation Systems) which includes Galileo, Glonass and the elderly and outdated GPS, but also Japan is soon introducing it’s own GNSS.

Having the European Community launching the new Galileo satellites gives totally new aspects in navigation and in this way Europe has beaten USA in space navigation systems for at least 15 years to come. Galileo has a better atomic clock, and while GPS is only based on 2MHz, Galileo will have a much better bandwidth with its 20MHz, so more data and functions will be introduced with Galileo. 

Suggestion: Link this article into GNSS, which would be definitely right, unless Wikipedia pages are American centric? <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:202.5.89.119|202.5.89.119]] ([[User talk:202.5.89.119|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.5.89.119|contribs]]) 05:32, August 28, 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})</small>

== GNSS Classification, original research? ==

I have searched the web to see if this is an existing concept, but can find no support. It appears to be original research. The only thing I found seems to be an [http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air_portal/traffic_management/studies/doc/finalized/roadmap_satellite_navigation_en.pdf opposing opinion] on the classification.

{{cquote|The GNSSP subgroup concerned with GNSS service levels convened on the 22nd and 23rd of April 2002. The subjects of discussion were Working Papers that presented a proposed GNSS classification scheme, service levels and also discussed how to use such a scheme in an operational environment. The group met following discussion in Working Groups A and B that had concluded that the classification scheme and service levels appeared unnecessary and that the added value needed clarification.}}

In the late '60s/early 70's there was a satellite navigation system called SatNav. The US Navy used it and it was expected to replace Loran. It wasn't as successful as hoped and I believe it is obsolescent. Lately, the term "sat nav" has become a popular generic term for GPS.

::I disagree, Sir. I find the term 'GNSS' highly misleading, as it suggests that navigation is the only purpose of a positioning system. While it might well be the most common application of a global positioning system, it most certainly is not the only one (I am using a GPS-enabled camera, for example, to have my pictures geo-tagged). The generic term for GPS, Galileo, Glonass, etc, should actually be GPS itself, imo. A pity the name is already taken. I would then suggest maybe GPSS - Global Positioning Satellite System, or would welcome any better name. The name, I believe, should *not* contain the word "navigation".  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Romulan Empire|Romulan Empire]] ([[User talk:Romulan Empire|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Romulan Empire|contribs]]) 15:52, 19 August 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:::Unfortunately, even if it is misleading (and I accept that many GNSS applications are doing more than 'navigation'), GNSS is the internationally accepted term for systems operating in the Radiodetermination Satellite Service (RDSS) and Radionavigation Satellite Service (RNSS) [[ITU]] bands.  See: http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/ for example. Therefore GPS (as well as GLONASS, Galileo, etc.) is a specific implementation of a GNSS, and GNSS is the over-arching term. --<font color="#0026ff">'''MarkPos'''<sub>([[User:MarkPos|User Page]] | [[User talk:MarkPos|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/MarkPos|Contribs]])</sub></font> 13:56, 23 August 2011 (UTC)

== This Article Is Misleading Regarding Implementation of Satellite Navigation Systems Around the World ==

This article identifies only 2 [Satellite Navigation System]s around the world – [GPS] and [GLONASS]. Viewing the article [Wide Area Augmentation System] I noted that GPS covers, basically, North America. It seems to have spotty coverage of Canada according to the number of ground stations (reference and master) in relation to square miles. The only other fully functional satellite navigation system seems to be GLONASS, recently restored by Russia. Some indications are made that China, India, Europe, and Japan have systems under development, but years away from completion. That would mean places like Australia, South America, GB and Europe, most of Asia (including Japan)south of Russia have no satellite navigation system. There is even a map of GPS within the [Wide Area Argumentation System] article that seems to confirm the regional implementation of GPS to North America.

And yet, I know this is not true. I've seen articles discussing whether or not GPS systems purchased in the US will operate correctly in Australia and I have used my phone's GPS with a local SIM card in Europe.

A WP reader should not have to read beyond this article unequivocal information regarding the extent of implementation of satellite navigation systems.

PS: one of the linked articles has concentric rings around the Earth with radii distances measured in miles, kilometers, and "Mm" providing information of the kinds of satellites/systems orbiting at those distances – I can't even guess what what the Mm unit of measurement is and there is no diagram "legend" or other explanation.[[User:Da5id403|Da5id403]] ([[User talk:Da5id403|talk]]) 20:11, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

I would have to agree. In terms of the purely technical standpoint, I believe that the only "global" systems are the GPS and GLONASS systems, where you can get coordinates anywhere on the Earth at any given time - all other systems are currently constrained to regional areas with 100% coverage all of the time. Though I haven't found any sources of information, I think a valuable stat to provide would be the percentage of global coverage where one can get a signal from the appropriate amount of satellites, at any given time (like if GPS/GLONASS are currently at >98% Earth coverage at any given time, if BeiDou is currently at 10% Earth coverage at any given time, and if Galileo is currently at 1% coverage at any given time). --[[Special:Contributions/99.250.141.178|99.250.141.178]] ([[User talk:99.250.141.178|talk]]) 21:27, 19 November 2014 (UTC)

{{reply to|Adamgerber80}}Please don't make same comparison since you have put Regional system of India in the GLOBAL section of the Navigation Systems, It is true that this section of wiki talks about Navigation Systems,  in this section talks about Global and regional systems, every section has their correct list . BUT that doesn't means that you put Indian regional system together with global Systems ( Indian regional system is already quoted in the section of "Regional Systems"),  that is why I have added the word "Global" in the list for not make confussion with people that read Wikipedia Because India regional Systems isn't equal with Global Systems, then you can agree or no, but is not correct that you try to put Indian regional system as a Global System  and trying to forget and not respecting  that this list describes and WARNS that is only  for " Global Systems".
However I agree to  create another list with "regionals systems" that would be good for people that want to learn more from wikipedia about Global Systems and regional systems, put it all together , we are making only confusion and fake argumentations. --[[User:LuigiPortaro29|LuigiPortaro29]] ([[User talk:LuigiPortaro|talk]]) 18:53, 26 February 2017 (UTC)
:: [[User:LuigiPortaro29|LuigiPortaro29]], First very important point, do not revert without reaching consensus. As far as I see there is no consensus on this topic since more then one editor has voiced an opinion other then the one you have. Please remember that these pages are written with consensus not unilateral decision making. Now, let's look at this page which talks about satellite navigation which can be both regional and global. Both those systems should be on this page since there is no separate page for either on Wikipedia. There is no arguing the fact that IRNSS is not a global systems but a regional one. My point here is to move the comparison of the systems to a separate section where it can be compared against all systems (global and regional). We can have a row in that table which clearly specifies what is global or regional to avoid confusion. But I think it is nice to have more systems to compare across since they use different kind of frequencies, orbits, and number of satellites. I want to reiterate again, this is not an attempt to equate IRNSS with any of the global systems but just have a comparison between all of them. If you disagree with this, please comment.

I think it is not a good way for talk about a great country  and not a good think for India, and when I say all regional systems, it means ALL! and also make a color for Global systems (expl. blue) and regional ones (yellow, or another color!) in this way we could do a job done very well, otherwise you will end up doing always what always happens on wikipedia ( vandalism pro Country / or I do not care what warnings says as in the case of the  list of Global Navigation systems),I will not change the list that you have changed today But , waiting for a good  agree and with a good suitable Table of  Navigation System/ Global and regionals   for Wikipedia. 
would be good  in the table or future list,  we separate the two Systems( Global and regionals) with colors and specifying the data of the satellites launching and the right date of operation. and Important Thing Specifying that they aren't equal. you and I know that they aren't equal , But people around the world no.

:: [[User:LuigiPortaro29|LuigiPortaro29]] First, I think you have a misunderstanding on what constitutes as [[Wikipedia:Vandalism]]. There exists a fine but a definite difference between misrepresenting facts for malicious purposes/POV pushing and good faith edits. This article is about Satellite Navigation not "Global" Satellite Navigation thus a comparison can be made between all satellite navigation systems(global or regional). One can argue that the placement of the table was restrictive since it was under global and that should have been corrected by moving it to an independent section and making it very clear the extent of the system(both of these have now been done). Next, may I inquire who created this rule you speak of? Wikipedia has [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment]] which is way to reach consensus(and on conclusion has to be respected by all editors) on any topic where 2 or more editors cannot reach an agreement. AFAIK, there as has been no RfC on this very discussion but there has been one on merging all Satellite Navigation systems into a single page. Third, Wikipedia is a volunteer effort and so information is added incrementally. If you wish to add other regional systems to that table or make it more "colorful", you are free to do so but you cannot remove any existing information unless it is wrong/fabricated. Lastly, I have warned you before and do so again to stop looking at these discussions through prism of a single country. On Wikipedia, all of us are editors and have to work together responsibly and respectfully since this a community resource. At times editors do tend to add information about their country because they know about it more and care about it more which does not mean that they are trying to show others down or prove that their country is the best.

{{reply to|Adamgerber80}} well my friend, I don't want to turn come back to talk always about who was the person that have put the Indian regional system in the list of Global systems. But it is always nice to remember that nobody here in the "talk Page" of Navigation System hasn't agreed  to put Indian regional System together with Global systems, that is why someone had put this message in the list  after repetitive acts of vandalism -"FOLLOWING TABLE IS FOR GLOBAL NAVIGATION SYSTEMS. PLEASE DO NOT ADD THE INDIAN IRNSS (NAVIC) AS IT IS LIMITED TO THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT IN ITS COVERAGE." that is why then I have delete the Indian section, But you're  right since the "Page" talks about Navigation Systems( Global and regionals) so  instead to put a colour for the Global systems , would be  constructive to put BeiDou,Galileo,GLONASS,GPS,NAVIC and QZSS of Japan, I will put  the Systems in alphabetical order and I will delete  the warning message to put Indian satellites together with the others Global systems, since this Page talks of Navigation System and not Global Systems.-- [[User:LuigiPortaro29|LuigiPortaro29]] ([[User talk:LuigiPortaro|talk]])13:57, 27 February 2017 (UTC)

== Suggestion to add diagram/image of coverage of various systems ==

There are now many systems that have been replayed that provide coverage in different regions. It would be ice to have a map that shows the coverage of the various systems available. [[User:Somerandomuser|Somerandomuser]] ([[User talk:Somerandomuser|talk]]) 16:24, 17 September 2017 (UTC)

== Positioning, navigation and timing ==

Positioning, navigation and timing should be its own page and shouldn't redirect here; PNT involves more than satellite navigation (INS & Loran, for example, are non-satellite-based PNT technologies).
