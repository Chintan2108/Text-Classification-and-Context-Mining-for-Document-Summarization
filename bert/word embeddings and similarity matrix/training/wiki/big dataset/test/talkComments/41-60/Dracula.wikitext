== Dracula's guest section ==

This seems a bit confusing:
"a wolf then emerges through the blizzard and attacks him. However, the wolf merely keeps him warm and alive until help arrives."
If the wolf does indeed attack Harker, it doesn't "merely" keep Harker warm. Attacking someone is a bit more than just keeping them warm and alive. I suggest this should be rephrased. -[[Special:Contributions/95.34.0.173|95.34.0.173]] ([[User talk:95.34.0.173|talk]]) 15:10, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

== Sequel ==

Bram Stoker's great-grand-nephew Dacre Stoker and direct-to-DVD-Slasher-film-writer Ian Holt's sequel "The Undead" is only one of many many so-called sequels to "Dracula." As Dracula is public doman, Dacre and Holt have no more claim to the title of 'actual sequal' than any other writers.
I think it is wrong to include their book and no others in this article. Perhaps the best thing would be to move any mention of any so-called 'sequels' to the "Dracula in Pop Culture" article. [[User:BoosterBronze|BoosterBronze]] ([[User talk:BoosterBronze|talk]]) 21:20, 27 October 2009 (UTC)

I agree, I think at least we should move the external link for the undead site from the dracula page to the dracula undead page.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.73.190.249|74.73.190.249]] ([[User talk:74.73.190.249|talk]]) 19:17, 15 January 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

The section on BACKGROUND of the novel "Dracula" doesn't need to include any refrence to a distant relative of Stoker's attempt to write a sequel a century later. It's irrelevant and gives undue weight to the otherwise hardly notable novel "Dracula The Undead." [[User:BoosterBronze|BoosterBronze]] ([[User talk:BoosterBronze|talk]]) 15:54, 18 March 2011 (UTC)

== Draculea ==

It says clearly in the "Search for Dracula" book, and in Romania, the Romanians themselves attest that the proper diminutive is Draculea and not Dracula. Dracula would be the feminine version. I know this wont change the article or suddenly cause all the books and movies to be re-written or retitled. It is a spelling error similar to the one for Aluminum Aluminium, one that caught on and now we're stuck with it. i only bring it up because it's a FACT and this is supposed to be an encyclopedia.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.113.49.126|70.113.49.126]] ([[User talk:70.113.49.126|talk]]) 19:37, 15 January 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Your information would be completely appropriate for an article about the historical person who inspired the novel and in fact is mentioned in that article.  But This is an article about the novel and Bram Stoker named his novel "Dracula."  The character in his novel he named "Dracula."  There is no evidence that Stoker ever considered any other name for his character.  So any discussion on what he "should have" named his character is pointless.

==Inclusion of Republic of Ireland in biographical section==
I'm responding to a comment left by an anon editor on my talk page [[User_talk:Malljaja#Dracula_edit|here]]. Evidently this editor is unhappy about the inclusion of the ROI in the bio box, since the ROI did not exist at the time the novel was published. Perhaps we can have a brief discussion as to how to deal with this info. I feel that the addition of this geographical detail is useful, since Stoker was born in what is now the ROI. There has been an earlier discussion [[Talk:Dracula#Country_-_Ireland.3F|here]], but this didn't seem to address this specific issue. Any thoughts? Thanks. [[User:Malljaja|Malljaja]] ([[User talk:Malljaja|talk]]) 01:35, 16 May 2010 (UTC)
:Its not that am unhappy, it just seems rather historically inaccurate and the edit has been reverted twice on the grounds of concensus has been reached to the contary - that i have yet to find.

::It seems that the most logical way to deal with any situation when a name has changed is to use the name that was in use at the time the event took place and then include in parenthesis a statement such as:   "(Now known as...)."  My family comes from Ireland.  When discussing the topic casually, I just use the term "Ireland."  But when I wrote our family's genealogy I used the name that was popularly used by Irish nationals at the time the event took place.  So in various places throughout the genealogy you might find Republic of Ireland, Irish Free State or Éire  depending on the date.

==Dracula's Guest section 2==
In reference to the current disagreement over the amendments made to the Dracula's Guest section (made by me), and in response to MarnetteD's queries, allow me to elucidate. Using "Englishman" is more correct than "Harker" because there is an age-old debate as to whether or not the character in the story IS actually Jonathan Harker. There is no conclusive answer, so using the non-specific "Englishman" is best. Using the word "vampiress" is not essential, but it is a term used freely in the Gothic/horror genre nowadays and I thought it was appropriate where I used it. However, the most important amendment I made was regarding the apparition of the wolf to the Englishman in the wilderness. The former description was unspecific and somewhat inaccurate (the wolf did not "emerge through the blizzard" nor "attack" the Englishman). My amendment improved the accuracy of the description significantly, though I too made a minor error (describing the Englishman as being forced to sleep in the forest for the night, which now seems a slight exaggeration, as it was a brief period of unconsciousness lol.) However, I shall see to correcting this directly. [[Special:Contributions/81.178.250.247|81.178.250.247]] ([[User talk:81.178.250.247|talk]]) 01:22, 12 September 2010 (UTC)

:Thank you for clearing up "The Englishman" usage. However, vampiress was not used in the story and is not widely used in the numerous vampire tales being produced today. [[User:MarnetteD|MarnetteD]] | [[User talk:MarnetteD|Talk]] 01:31, 12 September 2010 (UTC)

If there are users here who feel that the Dracula's Guest section is written in a "clunky" way (I felt it rude to say, but I thought the section was rather clumsily written when I first read it), then by all means do your best to de-clunkify it with your masterly skills in writing prose. But please do not simply revert it to a former version that contains inaccurate and missing details when I have made the effort to research and amend them. [[Special:Contributions/81.178.250.247|81.178.250.247]] ([[User talk:81.178.250.247|talk]]) 03:24, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
:As the contributor who reverted your edit, I'd like to explain why I did so. For some reason this entry is quite prone to vandalism or haphazard additions especially by anon IPs. I do appreciate that you want to add some more (although minor) detail here, so I'd suggest that you use a user name in the future, which could help elicit a more meaningful dialogue. Having said this, I stand by my statement that your edits are poorly worded: for example, "he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious" has several problems both in style and content. To "render unconscious" needs an active subject doing the rendering (if you insist on this phrasing) and "unseen force" begs the question, by whom this force is unseen? The Englishman, the reader, another party present, but not mentioned? This doesn't call for any masterly prose, but for plain English.  Since it's been a good while since I read this short novel, I cannot check the accuracy of the content, but I do feel that this section does not read well. Given that it only adds some very minor details, I therefore have reservations to leave it in this way. Thanks. [[User:Malljaja|Malljaja]] ([[User talk:Malljaja|talk]]) 22:40, 12 September 2010 (UTC)

We are not writing a best-selling novel here, but a concise synopsis of a short story in encyclopedic format. Therefore, issues such as "active subjects" and to whom the force is "unseen" seem quite pedantic and ultimately inconsequential. (By the way, isn't it obvious that the force is unseen by the character in the story? Realistically who else would it be referring to? And who is seriously going to scrutinise this in a synopsis anyway?) [[Special:Contributions/217.206.76.157|217.206.76.157]] ([[User talk:217.206.76.157|talk]]) 15:39, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

:[[User:Malljaja|Malljaja]], whilst I agree with you that the section doesn't read like Shakespeare, I think it remarkable that you find my edits alone to be below par and presumably the crux of what's wrong with the section. Other parts of the section read far worse than mine. For example, "''The short story climaxes in an old graveyard, '''where in a marble tomb''' (with a large iron stake driven into it), the Englishman encounters...''"  is a glaring mess of sentence structure that seems to have escaped your critical eye (it should read "where the Englishman encounters (the vampiress) in a marble tomb, etc"). Another would be "''This malevolent and beautiful vampire awakens from her marble bier to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison...''" which is far too much information crammed into one sentence. Having re-read the sentence that most displeases you, "''the Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious..."'', I do feel that your first concern about the absence of an active subject doing the "rendering" is pedantic - one might even say the absence of a subject is appropriately vague, because the moment in the short story is similarly vague and unclear, as we don't know who or what it is that has dragged the Englishman away and rendered him unconscious. Secondly, Bram Stoker's writing seems to imply that the "unseen force" is invisible to all, so that neither the Englishman, the reader, nor any voyeurs present at the scene would perceive it. I thought this was perfectly clear when I re-read the sentence I wrote, but if users want greater specification, they can always proceed to the [[Dracula's Guest]] article, which provides far more in-depth details. I encourage you to have a go at improving the style and content of the section if you wish, but I might suggest re-reading Dracula's Guest first so that you can accurately identify where the problems lie. Thank you. [[Special:Contributions/81.178.253.108|81.178.253.108]] ([[User talk:81.178.253.108|talk]]) 19:23, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

==Archiving==
Because edit summaries are limited let me post here. I archived a large chunk of conversations, some that went as far back as 07, today. I know that there is a way to archive into the talkheader but I have never known how to do this. Thus, I added an archive box template - to be honest I actually prefer these because the archive in the talkheader can be missed with all of the other info that is there. If any of you don't like this and want to move archive #2 into the talkheader please feel free to do so. My second thought was "Do we want to set up a bot to arc--[[User:JayJasper|JayJasper]] ([[User talk:JayJasper|talk]]) 19:14, 6 October 2010 (UTC)hive this page automatically?" That would prevent having as many stale conversations on the page as I found today. I have never worked with these bots so if consensus is to use a bot please set this up with my thanks. [[User:MarnetteD|MarnetteD]] | [[User talk:MarnetteD|Talk]] 18:51, 6 October 2010 (UTC)

==Films that "include a reference"==

I removed the following bit:

The number of films that include a reference to Dracula may reach as high as 649, according to the [[Internet Movie Database]].

I have no idea what "include a reference" is supposed to mean exactly, and the passage doesn't tell me.  Is it including Dracula as a character?  Or just mentioning Dracula off-hand?  Is it something else?  This isn't very useful as is.  [[User:Ekwos|Ekwos]] ([[User talk:Ekwos|talk]]) 05:54, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

:Agree with removal. There will be some more coherent discussion of the number of dracula movies somewhere in some authoritative book on horror cinema. [[User:Casliber|Casliber]] ([[User talk:Casliber|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Casliber|contribs]]) 10:14, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

::I also concur with its removal. Not all films involving vampires refer to Dracula and there is a distinct possibility that the number in the old info might include some of these. Thanks for the removal and for the clarifying post here. [[User:MarnetteD|MarnetteD]] | [[User talk:MarnetteD|Talk]] 17:14, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

:::At the risk of sounding redundant, I concur as well and want to add that as iconic as the Dracula character has become, it is now silly to count how many times he has been mentioned by characters in other movies or TV shows or other media, to the extent that it would be silly to mention in an article on rocks how many times the word "rocks" is spoken in movies.  As common place as Dracula has become in popular culture, it would only be appropriate to mention the total number of times he has been portrayed, by name, in movies.  A comprehensive list could be it's own Wikipedia article (if one does not already exist).

== Dracula's Guest ==

I am a high school student who has analyzed this story and Dracula's Guest in great depth. With many other English professors, I have concluded that the "Englishman" in Dracula's Guest is not Jonathan Harker, but Renfield. Renfield was the original lawyer for Dracula sent by Mr. Hawkins. But because Renfield went mad after realizing the power of Dracula, Mr. Hawkins sends Harker to do the job that Renfield assigned. I wish that an administrator edits the section about Dracula's Guest and cites my influence in the decision. 14:16 December 15,2012 (EST)

== Rename article to "Dracula (novel)" ==

It occurs to me that people searching for "Dracula" are more likely to be interested in the character [[Count Dracula]], than the novel.

I agree with the proposal ''in theory'', but I don't think that [[Count Dracula]] should be moved here. Rather, [[Dracula (disambiguation)]] should be moved here. While the character may be the single-best-known, as a character in a novel who is probably better-known through one or more of the novel's film adaptations, and also based on a [[Vlad the Impaler|real historical figure]] who actually had this name, he should still not be treated as the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]].

In any case that doesn't change my opinion of the page not needing to be moved. The Op does not seem to have picked up on my suggestion of an RFC.

If you revert my edits without explaining why [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dracula&diff=788449619&oldid=788357893] then you are acting in bad faith.

== The setting is 1889 ==

Where are your sources that the setting of the novel is in the 1890s?
If you take the entire logic of "Dracula" seriously, the last note is dated 7 years after the actual story. The novel (written as a collection of pseudo-sources) is published 1897, so the story happened before 1890.
Second, in Chapter 8 is mentioned that at August 11th at 3 a. m. a full moon shines. Full moons on this specific day are obviously very rare. In the late 19th century, this happened three times:
8/11/1870, when the Orient Express (mentioned in Chapter 25) isn't even built.
8/11/1889, which is in my opinion the night, when Dracula bites Lucy the first time.
8/11/1897, when the novel is published already.

==Dracula's Death==

There is a mistake here stating Dracula died by being stabbed by a Bowie knife. I checked copy of the book and while Quency Morris did stab Dracula in the heart with the Bowie at the same time Jonathan Harker decapitated Dracula with a Kukri knife. I'm pretty sure it's meant that the decapitation killed the count not the stabbing--Matthew Ilseman--Mornatur Ormacil 14:13, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

::Agree. Seems like the author of this and some other paragraphs (like that of the "Strange Wolf") based his or her synopsis on the Coppola's movie.--Mornatur 16:20, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== Bits and pieces ==

Shouldn't there be more historical context information in the analysis section, especially about victorian gender roles and the "new woman" concept? I also think it reads rather clumsily to include elements of vampiric lore in the analysis. There should be a separate section for that. [[User:Laurencooper|Laurencooper]] 11:30, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Hello? ''"a secret fraternal order of knights called the Order of the Dragon, founded by King Sigismund of Hungary (who became the Holy Roman Emperor in 1410) to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks"''?

Call me a running dog lackey of the evil rationalist zombies, but whenever I see something like this my [[:Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theory]] alert goes off. Anybody have anything to back this up?

(I'm not calling anybody names here, I just want to know where this came from.)

:The Order of the Dragon is an historical fact and can be defined with the lines above, yet it's not been clearly demonstrated the link between the Basarab (Dracula) family and such an order. An alternate theory on the ''Dracul'' name goes to the lingustic matter, and proposes "Dracul" or "Dracula" as a synonym to "Devil"--Mornatur 16:28, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

If I had time, I'd want to compare this article to [http://www.dreamsmith-graphics.com/wizglass/vlad.html] and other sources. --[[User:LMS|LMS]]

:Thanks, Larry. Page says that the info there "was taken from ''The Vampire Book, The Encyclopedia of the Undead'' by J. Gordon Melton""
----
''"Dracula is the most famous (fictional, or mythical) vampire."''

This would be as opposed to "real, non-mythical" vampire? 

:Well, we don't want five-year-olds reading this and finding out that, according to the encyclopedia, it seems that Dracula actually exists or existed! :-)  I'm not sure how best to word this. --[[User:LMS|LMS]]

:This would probably be as opposed to real, non-mythical vampyres:  People who believe their bodies are inhabited by the spirits of vampires, people who practice vampyrism or believe they have vampiric psi-talents, etc.  Basically, all those people who are real and non-mythical and who self-identify as vampires/vampyres or are identified by others as being individuals whose lifestyles are considered inspiration for vampire myths (Dutchess of Bathory, The Impaler, etc.).  People who suffer from [[Renfield's syndrome]].  Could also be as opposed to ''Vampyroteuthis infernalis'', the vampire bat, the mosquito, the tick, the leach, the lawyer, etc.  Who knows?  Lots of things could fall into the category of "real, non-mythical" vampires.  --[[User:Thorstejnn|Þorstejnn]] 04:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

I gave it a shot. :-)

But [[:Carmilla|Carmilla]] is definitely the most interesting... [[User:Sjc|sjc]]
----
There is no evidence that Stoker ever read anything about Vlad Drakul/Vlad the Impaler while doing research for his book.  See "Dracula: Sense and Nonsense" by Elizabeth Miller.  --corvus13

Oh dear, Elizabeth Miller really does have you wound up, doesn't she? Her viewpoint is kind of ''unique'' amongst scholars.... It is ''just'' a theory; there are many other arguments against her point of view. There are 3 threads to the source of Dracula: 1. Irish folk-myth (some of the [[:Sidhe|Sidhe]] were thought to drink human blood; 2. [[:Carmilla|Carmilla]] by [[:Sheridan le Fanu|Sheridan le Fanu]] and 3. (and problematically from Ms Miller's viewpoint) [[:Vlad Tepes|Vlad Tepes]]. 1 and 2 are not disputed by Ms Miller. Her argument definitely substantiates Carmilla as a source. But. Her arguments are based upon a number of assumptions, and while they are intellectually coherent, many of them are circumstantial. We will never know for sure. [[User:Sjc|sjc]]

::It would be interesting to lok out for some info on Abhartach, a celtic chieftain accused of wizardry and vampirism in his time. It's possible that Stoker have taken some data on him to buil his count. Yet, the novel seems to be less or more well documented about Tepes's life.--Mornatur 16:28, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

"A huge dog or wolf is seen running from the ship, " To note: the novel says only about a "huge dog"

== The strange wolf ==
"Lucy's mother is killed by a strange wolf and Lucy becomes pale and distrait. The Dutch vampire expert, Professor Van Helsing, is brought in and determines that Lucy's mother was killed by a werewolf and that Lucy is dying. "

Um, it's a while since I read the book, but isn't the wolf actually Drac in another form (as shown in the Buffy episode)?  Hence not a werewolf.

: There's a comment in the source of the page, reading
:: ''The wolf is a real wolf, which Dracula breaks out of London Zoo for backup; the narrative includes a press clipping about the wolf's mysterious escape and subsequent return. Is this worth mentioning in the plot summary?''
: I've left the comment there, and added "See Talk: page", as I interpreted the clipping as being the press 'explaining' the presence of a strange wolf, rather than as an actual explanation for it. &mdash; [[User:OwenBlacker|OwenBlacker]] 22:29, Jun 22, 2004 (UTC)

::That was me - and I stand by that interpretation, which I made having just re-read the book. The press clipping isn't ''about'' "the presence of strange wolf", it's about the mysterious disappearance and subsequent reappearance of an actual wolf of known provenance which had been at the zoo for years. It doesn't even mention the incident at Lucy's house. --[[User:Paul A|Paul A]] 09:02, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:::One reason for mentioning the clipping is that it is an example of the multi-media nature of the novel, as discussed in the opening paragraph.  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 00:18, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::::I've re-read the novel recently, and there are several interesting facts about all of this discussion:
::::First, there were always the possibility of the wolf being Dracula himself, for he demonstrated the power of transforming into several types of creatures during the novel; as in the arrival of the ''Persefone''.
::::Second, the news clipping actually doesn't mention the incident at Lucy's house, BUT it mentions the beast as being hurt in the face. The zoo guy even rants about the glasses on top of walls when he see the hurts on the wolf's head. This is consistent with the fact that the wolf entered Lucy's room by breaking the window and thus allowing the Count to get in and finish his dirty, yet delicious, job. --Mornatur 16:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== Fred Saberhagen ==
Should this page mention the series of books by [[Fred Saberhagen]] told from Dracula's point of view? ''The Dracula Tape'' is a re-telling of the original book by Dracula himself, taking a predictably dim view of Van Helsing's MO. There are several more, including one with [[Sherlock Holmes]] as Dracula's nephew (explaining the remarkable physical resemblance between the two characters :-). --[[User:Phil Boswell|Phil]] 11:01, Feb 5, 2004 (UTC)

:It does now. (Reminiscence: I once saw the first two books in the series published in an omnibus edition under the title ''Vlad Tapes''. Ouch.) &mdash;[[User:Paul A|Paul A]] 09:36, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== New image ==
I've just uploaded [[:Image:DraculaLugosi1931Poster.jpg]], but I've not added it to the article, as I don't know the copyright status.  I would assume that a 1931 film poster is now PD, but amn't sure how best to check... [[User:OwenBlacker|OwenBlacker]]
:At least in the U.S., something from 1931 would not be public domain, but a small image of a movie poster in a relavant context would almost certainly be fair use. -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] 17:53, Jun 25, 2004 (UTC)

== Separate book from icon ==
Compare this page to [[superman]].  In this case I think separating out [[Dracula]] (about the character, its history, the current meme and its many offspring in literature and otherwise; with a brief summary of the various tales of Dracula's life) from [[Dracula (book)]] (with detail on Stoker's novel, a more fully spoilered plot synopsis, and analysis of the text).  The many paragraphs of textual and character analysis are out of step with an article giving an overview of what modern audiences (who have yet to read the original novel) think of when they hear "Dracula".   For that article, perhaps a movie poster picture of a black-and-white dracule about to sahck someone's blahd? [[User:Sj|+sj]][[User Talk:Sj|<font color="#ff6996">+</font>]] 04:26, 25 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Love story?!? ==

I'd really like to know how the original novel ''Dracula'' became so much a "love story" that the claim was worth making in the first paragraph.  While ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' portrayed Dracula's pursuit of Mina as a love story, this is clearly revisionism and not what Stoker intended, and the relationships between the human characters really don't justify the classification of the book as a "love story".  -- [[User:Antaeus Feldspar|Antaeus Feldspar]]

:I concur, Antaeus. &mdash;[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 00:05, Sep 24, 2004 (UTC)

::I think it might be too complicated to put in the article, but I'm guessing that someone was trying to get at the idea of [[romanticism]], of which the novel is certainly representative, and got confused between romanticism and the eroticism of the Count's relationhip with the women, and came up with "love story".  [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]] 00:18, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Prehistoric Origins ==

In an early issue of OMNI magazine (now that takes me back more than a few years) there was an interesting speculation that the Dracula Myth might go back to prehistoric man. I don't have the original article, nor do I remember all of it (which is why this belongs here on the discussion page and not edited into the article). But the main point went something like this. When our ancestors were living in caves some might have strayed so far into them that they might have been bitten by bats, either when awake or asleep. This might have led to the onset of rabies, symptons of which can include an aversion to light and water. The madness that can follow might cause such problems in the tribe that killing the person might be the only way to protect the rest. Of course, this could all be terrible codswollop (or batswollop if you prefer). I wanted to post it as food for thought for Dracula fans and just in case it puts me in contact with someone who hung on to their copies of OMNI and can let me see the article again.

== fictional character VS book title ==

sorry if that has come up already, but I looked for the book "Dracula" and the first definition was: "Dracula is a fictional character" - wouldn't it be better to put something like "Dracula is both a novel and its eponymous antagonist"? ([[User:Clemmy|clem]] 19:06, 14 May 2005 (UTC))

== pop culture references ==

somebody should mention [[the simpsons]] episode that parodied bram stoker's dracula from season 5. where mr. burns is dracula.

==Influences==
It may be important to put moree influences on the story. Here is and *[http://truelegends.info/paranormal/dracula.htm example]. Stoker got his ideas from a lot of places, not just a few.

== Separating Book from Character ==

Shouldn't there be a page dedicated to the character of Dracula himself, perhaps listing differences between his various incarnations?

==Image Copyright Status==

The image of the Dracula postage stamp appears to violate the conditions of fair use that are claimed on the image page:
:''It is believed that the use of postage stamps to illustrate the stamp in question (as opposed to the subject of the stamp) … qualifies as fair use''
[[User:BrainyBroad|BrainyBroad]] 21:49, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

==Arminus Vambery==

I am fairly sure Professor Van Helsin makes a reference to Arminus Vambery at some point in the novel. If so, then there is some evidence of Stoker and Vambery knowing of one another and possibly communicating. Does anybody else know?
-- [[User:Pejhman|Pejhman]] 23:27, 07 January 2006 ([[AEDT]])

== Most accurate movie ==

According to Leonard Wolf a published expert on Dracula (who wrote "The Essential Dracula"), the most faithful reproduction was a BBC mini-series (I'd have to look up which) -- I think we should not be overly definitive about one movie or another being the most accurate. --[[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 15:19, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

:Mr Wolf is referring to the 1977 production titled ''Count Dracula'' with [[Louis Jourdan]] in the title role. It also starred [[Frank Finlay]] as Van Helsing and [[Judi Bowker]] as Mina. Although not a miniseries it was two and a half hours long and covered virtually all of the book. It includes all of the main characters with the exception of blending Arthur Holmwood and Quincy Morris. It includes scenes filmed in the town of Whitby and we see characters recording events in their diaries, letters and dictaphones much like the way the book is written. In particular the character of Renfield is very close to the way that he is portrayed by Stoker. Some viewers decry its special effects but if you take into account the state of BBC TV F/X of the time they are actually fairly effective (for me anyway). I have read at IMDb that it is available on DVD from ebay, although some postings on their message board say that the quality is so so. Here in the US it was an annual Halloween broadcast on PBS for a few years in the 1980's. My VHS copy of it is starting to show it's age a bit. I agree with your statement about easing the rhetoric about which versions are the most faithful and I will try to help in keeping an eye on this page. [[User:MarnetteD]] | [[User talk:MarnetteD|Talk]] 17:41, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

==Daylight Analysis== 
the Analysis section includes a mention that in ''Nosferatu'' was the first mention of daylight being fatal to the Vampire, and that in Dracula , the Count is able to move around by daylight. Would somebody point me to where this happens? Becaus I feel it's wrong.

My memory tells me of Harker meeting the Count only by night... and of the Vampire having to be carried in his earth boxes on the ship, presumably going out at night to feed, since the ship was mysteriously found devoid of life, and at the end, he's not moving under his own power but carried in a coffin by his gipsy servants. This goes well with the traditional view that, by day, the vampire must lie down in a torpor, and may not act (or he might have been able to defend himself at the very end... (he was looking exultand, gloating at the fact that the sun's disappearance would leave him free to act). 

Now, the novel is thick and I may not remember or never have noticed key passages. Just where in that book is the count active by day? --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] 21:59, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

:I just read it and the count is active by day throughout the entire novel. It is only by night that vampires transform into another creature or take ethereal form. Stoker had a lot of inconsistencies in the novel, saying one thing about vampires, and having them do another (for example Stoker early on says they are killed by a stake to the heart and/or cutting off the head, but Dracula himself is killed simply with a cut to the throat). The gypsy scene at the end is another inconsistency. --[[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 23:44, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

:It's been a while since I last read the book, but Stbalbach is right. Dracula prefers night time but he may easily move about during the day, albeit with limited powers. Orlok, in Nosferatu, however is killed by the rising sun as he stays on the equivalent of Mina's bed too long. As I understood it (but again, it's been a while) Bram Stoker has beheading as the means of killing a vampire - the cutting the throat may be just a part of that. But somehow the stake (in Balkan legends only to nail the vampire into the coffin, so that he stays there) has somehow become more popular, appearing in many vampire movies and even in the Lord of the Rings movies. [[User:Str1977|Str1977]] 09:08, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

:There are several instances of Dracula moving about during the day, though it is not clear that he was in direct sunlight at the time. The first is during the infamous shaving incident in the castle with Jonathan Harker, in which Jonathan cuts himself while shaving and notices that the Count has no reflection. The next is when we hear the testimony of a London zookeeper who tells how the Count visited the wolf Beserker shortly before he escapes the zoo. Then of course we have Mina and Jonathan's sighting of Dracula in London when Jonathan panics at seeing the person who for several months has inhabited his nightmares (interestingly enough, at that time, Mina describes the Count as looking "cruel and sensual"). [[User:PriestessofAssimbya|Rachel]] 13:51, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

:The "Daylight affair" can be solved by Van Helsing, when speaking to the men about the vampire: "(...)His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day.

:"Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.(...)" There is no word about daylight or sunlight being lethal - or dangerous - to him, and, as noted by the fellow editors, Dracula is seen several times during novel by day. Off course, knowing about his limitations, it's no less than logical tha he himself tried not to be so far away from his havens in case of need.

:About the staking or beheading vampire-killing method, "But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat. Whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart." The paragraph implies that Harker's knife - which is noted to be "great" - possibly cuts all the way through the count's throat, thus beheading him. Yet, as at the exact time Morris stabbed him and the body just dissolved, i think the question will remain unsolved. However, the logic says that just any kind of massive damage to vital parts - heart and/or head - could have been lethal. If you ask me, i'd rather put a hand grenade - or a dynamite bar - in his coffin.--Mornatur 16:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== minor change, first paragraph ==

Just made some changes:

changed the last sentence of the first paragraph to:

"much of the vampire's popularity in Western culture can be attributed to his novel, which spawned scores of theatrical and movie interpretations."

from :

"the novel's influence on the popularity of vampires cannot be overestimated, spawning scores of theatrical and movie interpretations."

the previous just sounded awkward, I didn't like the use of "overestimated", but some might not find it as awkward sounding as I did, so please change it back if it sounds better to you

== Suggestions ==

Ok some Drac-buffs need to do work here:

(1) Separate the novel and films from the character. The character should include different portrayals of him and also comparison to Vlad III. [[Dracula (novel)]] [[Dracula (character)]]

(2) The best picture we have is of a postage stamp?

(3) A separate article on the castle, with renditions and possible candidates for the real Castle Dracula. [[Castle Dracula]] or [[Dracula's Castle]]

The section explaining the references in [[Vampire Hunter D]] referred to the series as manga and movie series. I simply changed it to book series because the movies are not a series in any form.

== "Marxist Analysis" ==

I am not the author of this section but I felt the articles NPOV suffered because of this section. I hope the author is not offended and I'm glad they are contributing to Wikipedia, but this seems much to 'fan-crufty' to be included. It also is of questionable validity--[[The Wizard of Oz]] and the [[Gold Standard]] anyone?

:I have not read the below carefuly, but Marxist analysis of classic literature is pretty standard in academia. It's not OR or fan cruft because sources are included. This section needs to be distilled to its essence - 1 paragraph - and made NPOV and re-added to the article. --[[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 16:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

===Marxist analysis of Bram Stoker's dracula===
	It may not have been Stoker’s intent, but in light of contemporary global political turns, it can be argued that Dracula is a satire of  capitalism and the social castes that led to it. Stoker often creates and exaggerates the then modern divide between the classes, and illustrates the rising middle class in his mainline characters and their interaction with secondary personae. 

	Bram Stoker seemed to be very deliberate in placing his characters smack center in the social spectrum. Van Helsing, Jonathan Harker, Mina Murray, Lucy Westenra, John Seward and Quincey Morris are all members of the rising middle class by either trade, birth or marriage. [While Dracula and Goldaming are both members of the now defunct and then dying upper class or bourgeois.] As Senf notes “Considering the importance of class in the nineteenth century […], it would be a mistake to ignore class when reading anything written in the nineteenth century” (Senf, 99). This includes when one reads into the characters present in such a story. “Nineteenth century preoccupation with class should motivate readers of any nineteenth-century work to examine class issues, Stoker’s novel is so obvious in its treatment of class.” (Senf, 99). The barefaced nature in which Stoker separates class and defines the divide in Dracula only serves to further accentuate the satirical nature in which Dracula would be read by a Marxist or neo-Marxist observer.

	Dracula can be viewed as stokers Marxist attack in capitalist upper class citizens in Europe. “Recent Marxist critics have alighted on Dracula as illustrating what they see as inherent contradictions in capitalism”  (Leatherdale, 216) those illustrations in particular being the nature of Dracula as a vampire (whose nature it is to thrive by causing others two falter. The bourgeois, like the vampire, strives only to the end of impoverishing the lower class of money (blood) and to placate the proletariat’s desire to rise against them; “They, therefore, endeavor, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms.” (Marx, 24) In essence Dracula is the archetypal capitalist exploiter” (Leatherdale, 216) and is similar to the Marxist bourgeois in the way that he returns continually to exploit the blood of his victims; “No sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer, so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.” (Marx, 7). Stoker only strengthens these points when he makes reference to “The Czarina Catherine” in choosing a name for his ship; coincidence that the ship which carries Dracula (symbolic of capitalism and the bourgeois) away from England is named for a member of the monarchy that spawned one of the first, and most notorious Marxist revolutions?

	The nature of Stokers satire is reverberated and gains strength in the way he is consistent with his opinion of the working class peoples. As Senf suggests, “In general, Stoker is condescending towards his working-class characters, presenting them as drunkards and cowards, occasionally even as thieves” (Senf, 105) and as a result, he establishes a stage for Dracula’s air of superiority, and an exposition of his ignorance regarding the nature of his own social position. For instance “While still in Transylvania Dracula ‘works’ as a coachman, a cook, a chambermaid, and a valet” (Senf, 106). and “In England Dracula adds another menial occupation to his resume of skills—That of laborer. […] The laborer who helps him unload the boxes of earth at Dracula’s estate at Piccadilly” (Senf, 107). in both instances Dracula’s likens himself to the lower class, in contradiction of the nature of his aristocratic position as ‘count’.

	Finally one must take time to examine the nature of endings in the book. The time must be taken to notice it is significant that the the only American present was made to die. Ironic, how the nation that has become synonymous with capitalism today was represented in the book by a character who was unable to live. It can be assumed that this is representative of communist/neo-communist apathy towards capitalism. This apathy repeats itself in Dracula’s death, a most anti-climactic climax if there ever was one. Dracula falls limply from the protection of his box, and is slain by the quick and swift motion of a working class blade.

	 If stoker did not intend his work to be a Marxist satire on the capitalist bourgeoisie, and was instead truly a bigot against the lower class, it is the duty of the intellectual proletariat to interpret his work in such a way, and return it to the sphere of intellect, to demonstrate the efficient nature of the working class effort.

::I'm sorry, but i actually think most of the analysis it's based on loosely assumed premises which need to be revised. For an instance, in the second paragraph the Lucy Westenra character is placed as  a "member of a rising middle class", while Stoker clearly suggests, in one of Mina's diary entries, that the Westenra's are upper-class and maybe connected to nobility.

::In a broad sense, i feel the analysis a little bit biased and thus inadequate to inclusion in the article; maybe you can think on a separate article from where you can connect this with other ones in the same topic, but i think that when someone comes looking for info on Dracula - or any other subject - he/she should be provided with neutral information. As there are no arguments on the opposite direction to establish an equilibrium, the readers should find themselves biased, on favour or against the analyis and, consequently, the novel, which i think its anappropiate.

::Of course, it's just the most humble and respectful opinion. It's up to you, guys. --Mornatur 15:30, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:::Mornatur seems to be right (and the Marxist analysis above wrong).
:::The Holmwoods are top nobility, the Westenraas not very much below them,certainly upper class. Jonathan and Mina are of modest origins, though they quickly become wealthy through the death of Hawkins. Seward and Van Helsing are academics. Quincey an american adventurer of unknown social status, though there is some connection to Arthur. If there is any concern for class in the novel it is placed between the heroes, most notably the two couples.

:::"Whether or not Dracula was actually slain is never addressed, as he was attacked in a fashion dissimilar to Lucy and his reaction is distinctly different. However, Stoker's original manuscript contains a passage removed from the published novel in which Castle Dracula literally explodes at the instant of the Count's death, providing a note of finality to his demise."

:::It's a mistake: 

:::"As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.

:::"But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat. Whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.

:::"It was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.

:::"I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there."

:::Dracula died, his soul freed and his body dissolved, as Van Helsing earlier in the novel said it was possible to happen. The vampire hunters even took measures in the case it won't happen. I suggest the paragraph to be entirely removed from the article.--Mornatur 21:40, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

==Dracula: character basis==

When i first came upon this article - and this discuss page - i found myself troubled with the systematic doubt about the character basis of the count Dracula, and the several notations about the fact of Dracula possibly not being based on Vlad Tepes. So i went to read the novel again and found this on a Dracula dialogue on chapter 3: ''"Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them!"''

This, with some other phrases like this one - being this the most concise - and with the very detailed Count's portrait on chapter 2, make clear - at least to me - that the original inspiration for Count Dracula was, indeed, the Voivoda Drakulya, Vlad Tepes, and that Stoker has in fact made some research on him, the extent of such research being wide or narrow being a minor matter and unrelated to the fact of Stoker never having visited Transilvania by himself.--Mornatur Ormacil 22:47, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Dracula's Guest==
"In 1914, two years after Stoker's death, Dracula's Guest was published. This was in fact the deleted first chapter from the original manuscript, which the publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story." THis is tripe. Not even a cursory glance at the text can lead to such an error. Miller's work has shown this conclusively as well.

:::Note It looks like the "Dracula's Guest" material is indeed added to modern editions, but that this is done inconspicuously, so that the reader doesn't know the material was ever omitted and published separately.

There are several reasons people confuse Dracula with Hungarians.

Second, the most famous movie Dracula was played by Hungarian Bela Lugosi.  Lugosi even inserted some Hungarian into the scripts.  Last but not least, Hungarians ruled Transylvania for a thousand years.  Inspite of everything above the real Dracula was a Romanian.

==Themes Section==
Why has this not been deleted? It appears primarily to be the opinion of the writer, rather than of Stoker himself. Too much of an interpretive leap has been taken for most of the ideas expressed to be justified. For example, how can the writer say with any certainty that 

"If the novel sounds a cautionary note, it merely warns against the presumption that established science as yet offers a complete world-view. Within Stoker's fictional universe, (correct) superstitious beliefs have an empirical basis and promise to yield to scientific inquiry."

== Stoker's Knowledge of Vlad the Impaler ==

While it is certainly interesting to read all of these hypotheses that Stoker knew little of Vlad Dracul[e]a other than the name ''Dracula'' itself, this all seems a bit unlikely.  The ''Impaler'' is by far more common an epithet for Vlad than ''Dracula''.  Anyone doing even a cursory read on the historical personage is bound to run across his habit of impaling.

I've read ''Dracula'' recently enough to very clearly remember that an important element of Dracula's fictional history, and a plot element of such importance that to leave it out would likely cause the entire story to unravel, is that Dracula was something of a hero during his mortal life; a noble and passionate warrior considered by his people to be the epitome of virtue, valor, and bravery.  While it certainly tempts the anti-intellectualist in me to consider that Stoker may have been guilty of such poor research that he had no idea about his character's real-life counterpart being one of history's most sadistic monsters, it seems much more likely that, given Stoker would be familiar with this fact if he'd done enough research to find the name ''Dracula'', he intentionally omitted all the "Impaler" stuff to create a stronger piece of literature and to place the emphasis on the curse of the undead as the ultimate villain rather than Dracula himself.  This is far more consistent with what can be found in the narrative:  Mina reminds the men that Dracula was once fair and noble; that he is not simply a monster, or that if he is, Mina would someday be this too if they could not cure her.  Their fight became not one of revenge against Mina's assailant or a quest simply to rid the world of a great evil, but to free both Mina '''and''' Dracula's soul from the curse of the dead un-dead.  Not only would all this have been completely underminded if Dracula were a bloodthirsty fiend ''before'' his transformation into a vampire, but Dracula's own, unforgettable death scene at the novel's end would've been impossible.  The entire theme of redemption that rings so strongly throughout the text would've been either lost or convoluted beyond any clear meaning or message.

So there it is:  artistic liscence.  Again, while it might be fun to speculate that such an unparalleled work of literary perfection could've been based on plain ol' sloppy research, it is also rather POV to place the emphasis of this article thereon when a far simpler explanation — one consistent with the overall tone of the story and necessary for its theme and moral thesis — exists.  Stoker simply left out the parts about Dracula's real-world counterpart that would've underminded the story.  --[[User:Thorstejnn|Þorstejnn]] 03:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

You're assuming that everyone viewed Vlad as a bloodthirsty sadistic monster.  He fought the Turks and the nobles who sold out their people to the Turks.  Yes he was brutal in his methods, so were alot of "heroes" that modern-day history text books gloss over like Saladin who personally beheaded prisoners after the battle of Hattin or Julius Caesar who cruxified pirates and other prisoners.  The age of fighting that we are discussing was anything but civilized.  If you're going to make judgements about the distant past, you cannot do so with modern-day morals and codes of conduct.  Maybe Stoker knew exactly who Vlad was but he also wasn't writing historical fiction and therefore didn't have to include every single aspect of Vlad's life into Dracula.
Most likely, Stoker did base Count Dracula upon Vlad the Impaler.  Maybe all of Vlad's deeds were known back then, maybe not.  But we cannot conclude one way or another.

According to Elisabeth Miller(2000) and Christopher Frayling (1991) Stoker found the name Dracula and some historical information about Wallachia from William Wilkinson's book "An account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia: with various Political Observations Relating to Them" (1820). Stoker did have this book and he did make notes about it.[[User:Laurukainen|Laurukainen]] ([[User talk:Laurukainen|talk]]) 17:14, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

No other articles link to it, and since a large portion of this article is about Count Dracula (origins etc.) it would mean confusion between articles, there is no clear line you cant talk about the Count without talking about the Novel.

:All the other main characters in the novel Dracula, have their own page: Van Helsing, Lucie, Mina etc etc. To reiterate: 'Count Dracula' is a character in a novel called 'Dracula'. The novel is not his biography, and for long stretches he doesn't even appear in it, as the action focuses on Van Helsing etc. I think some people are confused with the film adaptations where Count Dracula dominates the proceedings throughout the entire action and then develops his own mythos and comes back to life several times etc etc. For comparison see also that [[Prince Hamlet]] has a separate article to the play [[Hamlet]]. IMHO it is a conceptual muddle to confuse a character in a novel with the novel itself and then further confuse that character with a later 'mythos'.

::Well, I don't see how you can separate the novel from the character in particular the "Allusions/references to actual history and geography" section. As soon as you start an "origins" section in the Count's article, you have a problem with repeat material and no "main article", in essence a fork of the same material across two articles (material with is controversial and requires a lot of vigilance to keep NPOV). -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 15:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

:::So do you have a problem with the separation of these characters from the novel 'Dracula' and the provision of separate articles for them, viz: [[Mina Harker]], [[Lucy Westenra]], [[Arthur Holmwood]], [[Quincey Morris]], Dr. [[John Seward]], [[Renfield]] and [[Abraham Van Helsing]]. The latter character especially is about as important as Dracula IMHO - as seen in the title of the latest Dracula film: 'Van Helsing' and the pairing of Cushing and Lee as Van Helsing vs Dracula in the old Hammer Horrors. Do not all your objections as to repetition of material apply to them also? As to question of POVs I don't understand your point at all. Wikipedia is open to editing by all editors and is not the preserve of any self appointed Dracula vigilance committee. And, anyway, if such a vigilance committee was up to the mark, there would already be an adequate treatment of the character Dracula in this present article, which I humbly sumbit, there is not. For instance there is no description of Dracula's appearance and nothing at all about him studying the black arts at the academy of [[Scholomance]] in the Carpathian Mountains (see ''Dracula'' Chapter 18 and Chapter 23). These are just two random instances in which this present article is seriously inadequate as a guide to the character 'Dracula'. [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 16:00, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
::::I would agree with Colin4C that there is a need for a separate article, not least because leading characters in other books have their own treatments. I think in this case it goes beyond that argument, though, as Count Dracula has a 'fictional independence' that goes beyond this one book - look at the over packing of this article with films and such which wander far from the original character who appears in Bram Stoker's novel. I would think that what people addressing this page would want is a concise readable account of the book.
::::Repetition is always a difficult problem, but it might be avoided with a more sensible balance in not overloading this page on the book - i.e. by offloading some of the greatest flights of cinematic fantasy to a page on the character.[[User:Kbthompson|Kbthompson]] 00:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

I agree with the above comments by Colin4C and Kbthompson that there is a need for a separate article to reflect the fact that the Count has taken on an entity of his own that deviates far from Stoker's creation. This would result in a more concise article on the original novel. [[User:Natalieduerinckx|Natalieduerinckx]] 21:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

: I also agree. Count Dracula has become an icon, different from the character in the novel, fully as much as Sherlock Holmes. Indeed, the character has been transmorgrified and brought forth in many new and different interpretations ''apart from the novel''. He has been a character on television series like ''Buffy'' and ''Superboy''. He has been the central character in multiple novel series as well as stand-alone sequels, reworkings, etc. Films have been made purporting to be sequels or retellings of his story, often with very little to do with Stoker's novel. This is pretty clearly a case where the character has gained a life outside his original source material. However, I do think the article would do well with an examination of how the interpretation of the character has evolved--from ugly demon to suave nobleman to cursed lover, etc. [[User:Zahir13|Zahir13]] 22:11, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::As I see it there are three entities: 
:1 'Dracula the novel' 
:2 'Count Dracula', the character who appears in the novel 'Dracula'
:3 'Dracula the character who appears in popular culture'. 
Maybe we need three separate articles?: [[Dracula]], [[Count Dracula (fictional character)]], and [[Dracula in Popular Culture]]??? Whatever we do, I think that we should carefully distinquish between the three different meanings of 'Dracula' and not mix them up into a confused bundle. [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 11:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

I see your point, I would initially go for separate sections on 2 & 3, within an article on "Count Dracula (fictional character)". If that schema, in turn becomes overloaded, then do the split. Any schema should be make sense to a casual reader and be easily accessible. Summaries (2-3 sentences) can be put in here, with main article tags, for the linked page. Doesn't that provide sufficient focus? [[User:Kbthompson|Kbthompson]] 12:40, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

There are two contradictory passages in the article:

[[User:Ubermonkey|Ubermonkey]] 17:03, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

dracula is gay wondering if Dracula was ever considered a racist work and an attack upon Eastern European immigrants who were coming into Great Britain during Stoker's time.

== Potboiler? ==

I have deleted the bizarre unreferenced assertion that everybody in Victorian England regarded Dracula as a 'potboiler'. As far as I am aware this is not true and not amenable to demonstration. Also 'potboiler' is a derogatory slang term - not suitable for an encyclopedia. [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 21:25, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

:Standard interpretation and easily cited from many top-tier sources including Norton Critical Edition and Leaonard Wolf. Potboiler is not slang it is a useful and often used term in academic works. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 05:31, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

::I have found many contemporary rave reviews from the Victorian period none of which call the book a 'potboiler'. The contemporary 'Christian World' called 'Dracula 'one of the most enthralling and unique romances ever written'. Other reviews called it 'the sensation of the season' and 'the most blood-curdling novel of the paralysed century' etc etc. Nowhere do I find it called a 'potboiler'. And my Collins Dictionary defines the term 'Potboiler' as an 'Informal' usage. I.e. not an academic term or one to be used in encyclopedias I have never seen it used in an academic sense. Maybe you could cite me an example? [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 10:47, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

::I have now looked at eight contemporary Victorian reviews of the book and NONE have called Dracula a 'potboiler': rather they have called it a classic of Gothic Horror and, inter alia, that it surpassed the novels of Wilkie Collins. [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 12:17, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

::And as for 'top-tier' Leonard Wolf I find his annotated versions of Gothic Horror classics very unreliable. His edition of 'Phantom of the Opera' was particularly bad and his edition 'Dracula' gives astonishing praise in the introduction to the true 'potboiler' author of all time: Anne Rice. Says the (un)sagacious Wolf apropos Rice: 'her work has a visionary grandeur of nearly epic proportions. If we look for a literary achievement as large and dark as her vampire trilogy, we must go back to Charles Maturin's 'Melmoth the Wanderer''!!! [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 12:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

:::[[Leonard Wolf|Leonard Wolf's]] footnotes in ''The Essential Dracula'' are sometimes trite, sometimes condescending toward Stoker, and frequently present a danger of "spoiling" (i.e. don't read the footnotes if you haven't read the novel yet!) [[User:TresÁrboles|TresÁrboles]] ([[User talk:TresÁrboles|talk]]) 23:48, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

:::No critic would use the term "potboiler" in a contemporary review unless they are being severely critical. But potboiler used by a literary historian is entirely different, for example [[A Christmas Carol]] is often called a potboiler in literary history. Stoker was writing many genre works to supplement his income as a stage manager, he needed the money and set out to write books to make money, the term potboiler is useful to get that concept across, as many literary historians have found. Since you find the distinction and contextual usage of potboiler problematic, I have removed it. -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 17:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

== Wallachian Voivodes? ==
With reference to this passage in the article:

:Vlad III was an ethnic Vlach. In the novel, Dracula claims to be a Székely - "We Szekelys have a right to be proud..." —. However, few lines down, Dracula claims ancestry from the Wallachian Voivodes - "Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed!"— This suggests either that Stoker had limited knowledge of the historical facts, or that he deliberately created a fusion of the different elements he found during research reading (the Transylvanian-born and Vlad III of Wallachia, and the Szeckelys with Hunnic descent).

Are we sure that that Dracula is anywhere claimed in the novel to be Wallachian? If you look up the [[Voivode]] article you will find that, inter-alia, Hungarian governors of Transylvania were called 'Voivodes' and that the term 'Voivode' is pan-Slavic, describing gov officials from Serbia, to Poland to Russia. Maybe its wikipedia editors who have 'limited knowledge of the historical facts' rather than Stoker...[[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 19:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

About the Hungarian (not Wallachian!) Voivodes (extracted from the Voivodes article):

:The Voivode of Transylvania (woyuoda Transsiluanus or erdélyi vajda in Hungarian) was one of the barons (or chief office holders) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The vajda was, in effect, a territorial governor or viceroy appointed by the Hungarian crown. He was also the chief magistrate and military commander of Transylvania's counties, and this power inevitably drew the Székely and Saxon territories into his sphere of influence however these territories were governed by counts who were nominally independent of the voivode. The title originated with the Slavic population, prior to the Hungarian conquest of the region. The Transylvanian voivodes, who were closely affiliated with the king, were often far from Transylvania, and local administration frequently fell into the hands of the vice-voivodes. However, some voivodes, such as László Kán (1297–1315), became powerful local rulers, effectively independent of the king. The title was in use from 1199 until the independent Principality of Transylvania emerged in the 16th century. [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 21:58, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

::Having repeatedly scanned the text of 'Dracula' I find absolutely no reference to Dracula's supposed Wallachian ancestry. Being the Voivode who crossed the Danube to fight the Turks does not make him Wallachian. Voivodes are not necessarily Wallachian and neither is that nationality obligatory in order to cross the Danube! [[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 18:06, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

This is the passage in the book that mentions [[Wallachia]]:

:"That treasure has been hidden," he went on, "in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt.  For it was the ground fought over for centuries by the '''Wallachian''', the Saxon, and the Turk.  Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders.  In the old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them, men and women, the aged and the children too, and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches.  When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil."

It doesn't really say Dracula was Wallachian. Stoker could be referring to the [[Battle of Călugăreni]] (1595) "..when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes", but hard to say for sure.  -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 00:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

== Country - Ireland? ==

At the time ''Dracula'' was published, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. Also the book's first publisher was a UK publisher. So shouldn't it read 'United Kingdom (now Ireland)' or something like that? [[User:Kohran|Kohran]] 22:01, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

The formal term for the Union at the time ''Dracula'' was published was The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. I presume the novel was released simultaneously in the UK and Ireland, so it appears that the info box is not accurate as it now stands. [[User:Natalie West|Natalie West]] 22:45, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

:It might be nice to list the editions of 'Dracula'. For instance as well as the UK edition, there was also a Colonial edition for the benifit of the British Empire. Later there was the American edition. I also read somewhere that the first translation was into Icelandic!

== Some Contradictions ==

This article:
'The novel is more important for modern readers than contemporary Victorian readers, who enjoyed it as a good adventure story; it would not reach its iconic legend status until later in the 20th century'

The Daily Mail review of June 1, 1897:

"In seeking a parallel to this weird, powerful, and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as The Mysteries of Udolpho, Frankenstein, Wuthering Heights, The Fall of the House of Usher ... but Dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these."
[[User:Colin4C|Colin4C]] 10:05, 28 April 2007 (UTC)

I tend to trust the views of academic literary historians [[Nina Auerbach]] and [[David Skal]], editors of ''Dracula'' by Norton Critical Edition. 1997. {{ISBN|0393970124}}, as a source, more than an original research interpretation of single primary source document.  -- [[User:Stbalbach|Stbalbach]] 18:57, 28 April 2007 (UTC)

::I don't understand the meaning of your term 'original research interpretation'. How is our interpretation of the words of the Daily Mail review (which is reprinted in the Auerbach and Skal volume by the way) different to our interpretation of the words of Auerbach and Skal themselves?

The problem is that the good count has achieved independence from the novel, and it could be argued that more contemporary accounts of the story actually have a more common usage.

*<s>'''Oppose'''</s>. Whilst I certainly agree that Stoker's novel is the primary and original usage, we decided a while ago that it was necessary to separate ''Dracula'' the novel and "Dracula" the character into separate articles, as the combined one was getting much too long, so effectively both [[Dracula (novel)]] and [[Count Dracula]] can claim to be articles about the "primary and original usage" of the word.

Then it was unilaterally changed without discussion by [[User:Daniel tara]] in May, who felt that [[Dracula]] should redirect to [[Vlad III the Impaler]], swiftly reverted to point to  [[Dracula (disambiguation)]], and then various other changes and reverts were made to the redirect (including a couple of reverts by me), none of them really discussed. So, anyway, given the long status quo of [[Dracula]] referring to the novel, I'm joining the growing consensus here and saying, yes, let's go back to that. --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 23:04, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

*Most definitely! That's why it should be titled [[Dracula (disambiguation)]] to show that they are subordinate to the novel. Although I think it would be proper to put a direct link to the Count at the top of the novel's page. [[User:Reginmund|Reginmund]] 20:40, 17 July 2007 (UTC)
*You may be interested in taking a look at ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (the novel), [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Frankenstein in popular culture]] to see the successful split that the split of the Dracula articles was inspired by. --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 23:07, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

''Another borderline decision, but I think there is more in favour of having the novel at "Dracula" than anything else. Not least, it is the only one of the major topics whose title actually is "Dracula" (cf. [[Count Dracula]], [[Vlad the Impaler]], etc.) Also, the article had been at that title for a long time, and no consensus was sough t or apparent for the move to [[Dracula (novel)]]. Finally, having the novel at "Dracula" does fit better with the pattern established at [[Frankenstein]] of treating the novel as the primary topic.''

::Fair enough. I have today clarified (yet again!) the rationale of the [[Count Dracula]] article in the top-headings there. These top-headings keep getting altered by neophyte editors, not party to our discussions here, to whom, seemingly, the conceptual difference between a character in a novel and the novel itself is one of life and literature's major mysteries.

==Editions==
Abovementioned were translations of Dracula, and annotated or other editions of Dracula.  If anyone has access to that information, I believe that would be a valuable contribution to the article. [[User:Schizombie|Шизомби]] 14:24, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

== RE: Noferatu copyright issues ==

The article states the fact that Mrs Stoker refused rights to the producers of Nosferatu; however, it should be noted that releases of the film in the US in fact did use the names from the novel. Orlok was Dracula, and etc. --[[User:Bentonia School|Bentonia School]] 06:40, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

== RE: Vlad ==

Any reliable citations to refer to Stoker not basing Dracula on Vlad? This is the first I've heard of it. --[[User:Bentonia School|Bentonia School]] 10:36, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

== Origin of the word "Dracula" ==

The article suggests that the name Dracula derives from the word "Dracul" and from the historical character of Vlade III Dracula.
However, I have "An Enriched Classic" series edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula, and in the extra credits the word "Dracula" is said to have derived from gaelic words 'droch fhola', meaning bad blood. Does anyone know with certainty of the true origins of the name Dracula, or are all the stated explanations possibly true?

Here's the entire passage from my book, explaining the origin of the word Dracula:
" '''Dracula:''' The name ''Dracula'' is a pun on the Gaelic phrase ''droch fhola'', meaning "bad blood". It is an indication that Dracula may be read as an Irish monster-an Anglo-Irish Protestant landlord or a Gaelic Irish Catholic revolutionary-remains a matter of deliberate ambiguity. "

Here's a (commercial, sorry!) link to a description of the edition of Dracula that I have:
http://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Enriched-Classics-Bram-Stoker/dp/0743477367/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195217627&sr=1-3

Perhaps this explanation of the origin of the word could be included in the article?  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.113.117.7|88.113.117.7]] ([[User talk:88.113.117.7|talk]]) 12:56, 16 November 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Themes ==

I removed the following two paragraphs:

<i>
Along with advances in technology and industry was the Victorian perception of a decline of morality and faith-based values; sexually transmitted diseases were becoming common, especially [[syphilis]]. Plagues were believed to have been introduced from without. Dracula, who 'transmits' his vampirism via a highly erotic method, represents a carrier of social fear and decline.

The character of Dracula is representative of 'foreign' and 'invasive'. This fear of the foreigner ties into the theory of Reverse Colonization, where a powerful nation is taken over by a more primitive group. Dracula's character represents these primitive people who come to dominate developed nations. By portraying Dracula as a strange, alien being, Stoker reflects the views of Victorians towards immigrants.
</i>

not because they were nonsense, but because they were nonsense which had no references.  There are some factual assertions which I would like to see cites for. As for views regarding foreigners, the Count was described as highly intelligent, well-read, and physically the strongest. And don't forget the other foreigner. How would our English vampire hunters have fared without the capabilities of the Dutchman, Van Helsing?

Feel free to add those paragraphs back in when the proper references are cited so that we know whom to ridicule. [[User:TresÁrboles|TresÁrboles]] ([[User talk:TresÁrboles|talk]]) 00:42, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

== publication date ==

I've read on a number of websites that the novel first came out on May 26 1897. Should I put it in the infobox? It seems odd that the infobox doesn't even say what month Dracula was published in.

==Dracula's heir==
I was the one who added the Official Sequel category a few months ago. When I found the info for the first time it mentioned the upcoming sequel titled "The Un-Dead" was being based on Stoker's original notes. This isn't about that section but I was in a bookstore and found a book titled "Dracula's Heir". Looking through it. It appears to have a lot of story also based on Stoker's original notes. The book's copyright says it was published in 2008 by Quirk Productions, inc. I was going to dismiss it as another fan made sequel but it is very similar to what the upcoming sequel sounds like. Is this just another fan made sequel or what is it? It revolves around why Dracula's guest was cut from the book. The main story is girls go missing renfield and Harker are suspects. Dracula may have returned. I will read the whole thing. Is this based on Stoker's notes? The book is by Sam Stall.--[[User:VampireKen|VampireKen]] ([[User talk:VampireKen|talk]]) 03:45, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

[[User:Pigeoninlet|Pigeoninlet]] ([[User talk:Pigeoninlet|talk]]) 15:12, 17 January 2009 (UTC)
I cannot comment on Stall's book (haven't read it) but I do know a thing or two about Stoker's Notes. In fact, I am co-editor of the recently published "Bram Stoker's Notes: A Facsimile Edition" (McFarland, 2008). This book contains 124 pages of handwritten and typed notes Stoker made while working on "Dracula." Believe me, these notes clarify a number of crucial issues: the relationship between "Dracula's Guest" and the novel, where Stoker found the name "Dracula" and why he used it for his vampire, his information about Transylvania (and his sources), etc.

Thanks. and Dracula's Heir is a fictional version of why the chapter was removed. Thanks for verifying other things for me.--[[User:VampireKen|VampireKen]] ([[User talk:VampireKen|talk]]) 23:06, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

:Got a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for it? --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] ([[User talk:Stormie|talk]]) 21:31, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

There is this Austrian documentary from 2007 titled "Vampyrprinsessan" (The Vampire Princess).
I just saw it on Viasat History right here in Sweden. 
Here is a link from the English history channel.
http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/World_history/programme_429.php 

It is the fact that after she died, the doctors ordered autopsy where it was never done on royalty and aristocracy. True, they discovered a tumour, but at that age, they did not know what it was.
Also, there were also some remains found in the area with the head chopped off and placed between their legs.
When Eleonore von Schwarzenberg was buried in the church, her coffin was not only lowered into the crypt, but also surrounded with a solid, concrete type cage so she would not raise as a vampire. It was like a coffin inside a coffin.
Heres a link to the video. It is a clip where the archaeologists open the tomb and lower the camera inside.
