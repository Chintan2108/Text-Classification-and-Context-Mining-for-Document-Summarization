Didn't [[Switzerland]] recently become a full UN member? - [[User:Stewacide|stewacide]] 12:21 Jan 1, 2003 (UTC)

:Yes, Switzerland -- (September 10 2002).  I deleted it from the observer states list.

The picture is labelled with copyright info, and labelled ''Must Credit Author'' on its image page: this appears inconsistent with the [[GFDL]], so I will remove it.  Can the author of this picture donate it under the GFDL, please? [[User:Arthur Frayn|Arthur Frayn]]

Not sure about violations of [[GFDL]].  But the UN allows use of photographs for editoral/education purposes and NOT for advertising or publication, without payment.  --PY

Sadly, that's the kind of restriction the [[GFDL]] is incompatible with. I have found a picture from the U.S. Government NARA site, which appears to be in the public domain, to replace this with. [[User:Arthur Frayn|Arthur Frayn]]

That's good. --PY

I think we should move the observer list to [[United Nations member states]]--[[User:Saint-Paddy|Saint-Paddy]] 17:14, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Were there any resolutions introduced in UN General Assembly condemning US military actions during/after the US invasion of Iraq ?

== location, location, location? ==

can someone please add some details of where these general assemblies are held. are they usually in one or more set place(s), or do they move around, and if so, what factors decide the location?

:They meet generally in New York and occasionally in Geneva.

== Always a Brazilian Claim ==

It is getting quite annoying that people keep removing the widely well known fact that the first speaker of the General Assembly is always a Brazilian delegate. Nevertheless, when I added this bit for the first time, I took care to mention the sources but seems that people keep removing them:

* [http://www.mre.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1714&Itemid=1259 From the Brazilian Minstry of Foreing Affairs]
* Just check the UN website for past transcripts and you'll find that in every General Assembly Session, the first is always a Brazilian

This is a wide well known fact amongst people that have a little knowledge about the UN General Assembly. Now, if people editing this article is anware of the matter, that doesn't mean it is wrong. Just have a look around, otherwise it just look like an interesting tradition about the Assembly is being undermined (politics, perhaps?) --[[User:Pinnecco|Pinnecco]] 20:15, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

Why does the infobox list him as being from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia?  if no one can come up with a reason I plan on changing in to the correct Republic of Macedonia.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Schrandit|Schrandit]] ([[User talk:Schrandit|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Schrandit|contribs]]) 17:25, 8 October 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:The constitutional name is [[Republic of Macedonia]], but the name used by the UN itself is "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" (alphabetized under "t"!). Some editors feel that this means we should follow the UN's naming convention in articles about the UN, even though we use the other name elsewhere. I'm personally not enthusiastic about that rule, but it came out as sort-of-consensus in the latest rounds of discussion, while trying to come up with a set of naming conventions at [[WP:MOSMAC]].

== GA Subsidiary bodies ==

If you go and count every GA subsidiary body as shown in the following website- http://www.un.org/ga/about/subsidiary_organs.shtml you will get:

GA ad hoc Committee	7
GA Advisory Commission	1
GA Advisory Committee	3
GA Advisory Committee	6
GA Committee	        15
GA Council	        2
GA Executive Committee	1
GA Governing Council	2
GA High-level Committee	1
GA Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group	4
GA Other	        3
GA Panel	        1
GA Special Committee	4
GA Working Group	3

Or if you prefer:

Commission	1
Committee	37
Council	        4
Other	        3
Panel	        1
Working Group	7

Both tables exclude the six main committees. But the data is clearly at odds with the information presented. Foremost, the UN website says there is "only" one commission (as opposed to seven). Some of the others, although were created by the GA, are not GA bodies proper (they report to other bodies such as the Security Council, the Secretariat or ECOSOC), and are thus not subsidiary bodies to the GA.

I do not know (yet) how to properly present this information. Just to note what is presented is erroneous.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.104.17.63|92.104.17.63]] ([[User talk:92.104.17.63|talk]]) 19:11, 11 August 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The members of the General Assembly are countries, not individuals. Each country has the right to be represented at Assembly sessions by a delegation consisting of up to five members and five alternate members. This is spelled out in the Rules of the General Assembly.

== Improvement Suggestions? ==

Hey everyone, I'm going to work on this article to try and fix it up to GA status. Mostly going to focus on citations, but I plan to fix up general content as well. Any suggestions would be very much welcomed! [[User:Kaireky|kaireky]] ([[User talk:Kaireky|talk]]) 19:29, 7 December 2013 (UTC)
:There should be a section on the General Assembly President, not much is said in [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|that article]] either on the functions etc. of the President, or his Vice-Presidents. I noticed that some people started writing articles on the sessions of the General Assembly, something on those could be added ([[Sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly|68th]], for example). And the article [[List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations]] should be given some exposure, as it lists the people who actually compose the General Assembly. Just from the top of my head. --[[User:Mátyás|<math>\color{Blue}\mathcal{M}</math>]][[Special:Contributions/Mátyás|<math>\color{Blue}\vec{( e\ ,}</math>]][[User talk:Mátyás|<math>\color{Blue}t )</math>]] 19:56, 7 December 2013 (UTC)
::Thanks! I'll make sure to make sure work those in, they make sense. There definitely needs to be information on the President, and what I add to this article I'll make sure to add to the UNGA President page as well. [[User:Kaireky|kaireky]] ([[User talk:Kaireky|talk]]) 00:43, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
Looking at the article, here's how I think the sections should look:<br />

#History
#Membership (this is where [[List of Permanent Representatives to the United Nations]] would be linked to)
#Officers (President and Vice-Presidents)
#Procedures (Agenda, Special Sessions, Emergency Special Sessions, and Seating in the GA merge into this section)
#Functions and Powers (Elections merges into this section)
#Resolutions
#Subsidiary Organs
#General Assembly Reform<br />
Ideas? [[User:Kaireky|kaireky]] ([[User talk:Kaireky|talk]]) 00:43, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
:Looks good, but the powers and functions of the General Assembly ''per se'' are not covered in any one section, this information is scattered over the article and not really comprehensive. And a ''Membership'' section should definitely link to both [[Member states of the United Nations]] and [[Enlargement of the United Nations]].--[[User:Mátyás|<math>\color{Blue}\mathcal{M}</math>]][[Special:Contributions/Mátyás|<math>\color{Blue}\vec{( e\ ,}</math>]][[User talk:Mátyás|<math>\color{Blue}t )</math>]] 10:00, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
::Oh and yes I intend to add information in these, not just move stuff around. Once I took the time to really read through the whole thing I realised it was somewhat of a mess. The UNGA website has a whole section on functions and powers, information which is not given anywhere in the current version of the article. Thanks for the page links as well, since I'm still rather new I don't quite know what all pages there are that directly relate to what.
