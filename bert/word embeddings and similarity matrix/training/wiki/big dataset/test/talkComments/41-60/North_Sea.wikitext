== Leading paragraph ==

So, as the talk page notes in several discussions above, the lede for this article is tricky because there is so much information and it is difficult to summarize concisely.  I have just significantly rewritten/reorganized the lede because i thought it it did not read very smoothly; it was more like a list of facts than a summary.  Furthermore, there aren't any body of water featured articles or any real templates I could find to base this off of.  I have tried as far as possible to make these changes in accordance with [[WP:LEAD]].  It states that an article of this size should generally have a lede of about 4 paragraphs and focus on aspects in proportion to their importance.  I arranged it thus: 
# What, where, and how big?  for a geographical article i think these are the most important items. 
# why is this notable now? most people are probably more interested in what's going on now than working up through history.  this wound up being basically summary of the economy since it's geopolitical importance has waned. 
# History.  I thought the flow of "it's important now because... Historically, however..." was smoother than splitting it up.  
# Geology, geography, and environment. These items have less to do with the notability of the sea and are more just general facts about it.  The fjords are kind of notable since the best examples are on the north sea but the economy and history are, it seems to me, the reason more people will be coming to this article. (this is certainly a judgment call; I am open to arguments the other way.  But I couldn't really think of any myself.)

I tried to remove any facts that might want citation.  I also tried generally to remove any specific facts in favor of a very general overview.  Any given fact in a summary takes you on that slippery slope of 'if we include this we have to include that.'  Also broad characterizations make for smoother reading than lists of facts.  

Anyway I figured, since the lede has been through several iterations I'd try to get a general outline for people to agree on in here so that we can avoid complete rewritings as much as possible, but I welcome any comments to this framework or edits.  --[[User:InspectorTiger|InspectorTiger]] ([[User talk:InspectorTiger|talk]]) 21:00, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

== France ==

It would appear that France is one of the littoral countries of the North Sea but it is not included in the first sentence.[[User:Eregli bob|Eregli bob]] ([[User talk:Eregli bob|talk]]) 15:41, 20 June 2012 (UTC)
:Yes, but only just. Mentioning it may imply that all of France's coast is on the North Sea, whereas it is actually only a very small part. [[User:Bazonka|Bazonka]] ([[User talk:Bazonka|talk]]) 17:34, 20 June 2012 (UTC)

''''''If we have to mention France and the North Sea (sorry, but it just isn't a Northsea nation for me) then maybe the geopolitics behind it, and also explain away how places like Deal and Margate are considered lying on the English channel even though they lie somewhat to the north of northernmost (North Sea lying) bit of France.

:About 45km of France's coast is on the North Sea, and Deal and Margate are definitely not on the English Channel. Who says that they are? [[User:Bazonka|Bazonka]] ([[User talk:Bazonka|talk]]) 17:50, 1 October 2015 (UTC)

== Maps less than satisfactory? ==


With regard to the map currently sitting in the 'economy' section, it would be useful to know what the black line running through various countries is - I'm presuming it's the drainage divide. If confirmed we should label it though perhaps for the purposes of the section one without that adornment might suffice. The drainga ebasin is dealt with elsewhere.

As regards the 'geology' section, I'm not convinced the existing map is helpful or relevant as the map covers much of Europe, N Africa and the Middle East and the N Sea is in one small corner. 

Can anyone improve the article on either count? - my own abilities with images on WP are limited!  cheers 11:06, 13 October 2013 (UTC)

== Less known German name ==

I don't know, how to handle the knowledge, or better, where the right place to right is, but I don't think, it's unimportant. A more or less uncommon German name is "Blanker Hans" (means: "bare/naked Hans"). It's only known in north Germany, if it's known. Also it's used in the poem "Trutz Blanker Hans" (resist Blanker Hans), an poem about the town "Rungholdt", which was destroyed by a North Sea's storm.[[Special:Contributions/79.194.208.144|79.194.208.144]] ([[User talk:79.194.208.144|talk]]) 15:22, 29 March 2016 (UTC)
:Is it a real name, or just a nickname? If the latter, I don't think it should be mentioned. If it's a proper name, then we would need a reliable source before it can be included, and even then I'm not convinced that it's relevant for an English-language encyclopedia. Let's see the source first though. [[User:Bazonka|Bazonka]] ([[User talk:Bazonka|talk]]) 18:11, 29 March 2016 (UTC)

== German Sea ==

== North Sea didn't protect Britain from invasion until the Romans ==

The article now states that "The British Isles had been protected from invasion by the North Sea waters until the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 CE". That's nonsense of course. There have been numerous invasions into Britain before those time, the latest before the Romans were by some [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes just 1 or 2 centuries earlier. Another major invasion that we now know of, is the one by the [[Beaker culture|Beaker]] people.

==German(ic) Ocean/Sea==
A quick check of the Oxford English Dictionary shows that North Sea was in use by the 13th century, and in common use in the 18th.  German Sea and German Ocean were in play, but were never the exclusive English term simply displaced by war-fervor.  The usages in the OED implies that "German Ocean" is more a learned term (as a translation of Ptolemy's ''Germanikos Okeanos'') and that "North Sea" may be more common, but I may be misreding the usages.  --MichaelTinkler

: I agree. I started to write a long list of supporting evidence, then found [http://www.eastsea.org/article3/report3.htm this article] which sums it up nicely. In reality the North Sea had not been called the German Sea or German Ocean in everyday English speech for centuries prior to [[World War I]]. One question which remains is whether there was an [[archaism|archaic]] "official" name that was changed to reflect the ordinary name during the War. However, the ''first'' body providing "official" British usage for place names outside the [[United Kingdom]] proper was the [http://www.pcgn.org.uk PCGN], which was not founded until [[1919]]. Thus, the claim appears to be an [[urban legend]]. I'll leave the claim for a day or so to see if anyone can come up with supporting evidence, then remove it. --Roger 13:40, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)

If the Kattegat is a bay of the North Sea, and Sweden borders on the Kattegat, then why doesn't Sweden border on the North Sea?--[[user:Branko]]

From a Danish/Swedish point of view, it is doubtful whether the Kattegat is ''a part'' of the North Sea. But the precise delimination of the Northern waters is controversial.<br>

The German Hydrographic Service used to define the Kattegat as part of the "waters between North Sea and Baltic Sea" (along with Sound & Belts and maybe even Kiel bay). I am not sure whether this terminology is still used. [[User:Kosebamse|Kosebamse]] 11:03 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)

Hello - can someone explain what the above piece of text under "Headline Text" is for? [[User:Gzcsy3|IanB]] 12:14, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

Hi, speaking both German and English I may be able to enlighten everyone as to what use the above list may be. When referencing German words(other non-English languages also) it requires a lot of diacritic marks. To open a character map page or searching for an ASCII number every time is tedious, thus the list above allows for a quick copy and paste when a specific character is required. I may be wrong, but it seems quite useful to me. [[User:Pmi25|Pmi25]] 05:23, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

The Baltic Sea section on Geography is excellent ..but less applicable here as the boundaries can't be rigourously defined.

that map's really bad. the link to the encarta thing that other guy posted has a wonderful map.


== Expand ==

Does any German speaking person intend to fulfill the translation request anytime soon? I wish I could do it. But I was thinking of just using some English reference material that we can find on our own to expand this article. I might propose a list of good sources and then anyone else interested in the article is welcome to work with me. [[User:Dashes|ΞΞΞ]] 18:05, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

yes i am working on translating this article from the German along with Island Kayaker. [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 00:55, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

Could someone have a look at the non-English word 'Kontors'.  Its translation is office which seems inappropriate for the context. Would outpost be better? [[User:JRPG|JRPG]] 12:26, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

Kontor has an article in English wikipedia. i have now fixed the link. [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 19:02, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

== History Section ==

i think the history section is a prime candidate for summarization to reduce the size of the article.  it has already been split off into its own article and it is very long and includes several very detailed parts. (possible 3 sections: "Early history"=romans and vikings, "Northern Europe's commercial highway" or something to do with commerce and trade=Hanseatic league, the Netherlands, and Britain, "20th Century"=the rest.  Thoughts? if no one beats me to it ill post a link to a draft here. [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 02:04, 13 September 2007 (UTC)


Re the history section, I certainly felt uncomfortable with it but WW1 is now perhaps too short! The sinking of 3 old cruisers by [[U9]] was the startling first proof of what submarines -which almost caused British surrender in 1917 -could do. It was taught in Naval staff colleges and should be mentioned.  

The article should also say that the Grand fleet moved to Scapa to effect a distant blockade.   

"Britain strove to maintain the blockade and, if possible, to damage the German fleet enough that British ships could be used elsewhere."  Where else could the ''fleet'' be used? The Baltic was too dangerous.  The men could certainly be used but this isn't what is said. [[Scheer]]'s stated aim before Jutland was to lure out ''part'' of the fleet to destroy it and thus weaken the rest.

Surely [[Jutland]], the largest ever naval battle requires a mention.

:Please make these changes to the [[History of the North Sea]] page and feel free to add it here but i really am gonna try to get around to summarizing this section sometime soon so individual facts might not be around very long, but im certainly not an expert so the more info ive got the better summary ill be able to make. [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 00:06, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

Hi Jieagles.   Edit to the [[History of the North Sea]] WW1 is done, the wording I hope more concise. The talk edit was done at night -sorry if it sounded a little tetchy!
There seems to be duplicated items on North Sea history which would benefit from merging.

== Units and spelling ==

I believe i have fixed all the units so that they appear initially in metric and then parenthetically in US exceptions being a couple of times where source material was US (eg. 100ft boats).  

i also though it would be better to use abbreviations for source units mainly due to spelling discrepancies throughout the article (meter/metre) and the unusually large number of times that these units appear make it unnecessary to repeat every time.  (See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Unit symbols and abbreviations]] this seems to be a reasonable exception as defined there.)

I also changed all (i hope) the spelling problems to American spelling because i was going through already and my browser has a AE spell check so it was easier for me to do it this way simply to attain uniformity.  If someone wants to change it all to BE, the content makes that reasonable though not necessary.  [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 15:18, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

==Introduction==
I have made a sandbox page to play with introduction.  [[User:SriMesh/Sandbox/NorthSeaIntro]]  Under the paragraphs there is a ''discussion'' - table of contents to introduce, concepts from WP lead 1. Context  2. Characterization 4. Compare and contrast 5. Criticism  , and peeked in at wikiproject lakes and rivers to try to give me an outline for the lead to consider. The whole article has been introduced by four paragraphs  for an introduction.  I alleviated some concerns on the North Sea talk page, and put the other names of the North Sea in to the second paragraph, and took out the technical terms from the very first paragraph.  What do you think of the paragraphs above ***----***---***---***  at [[User:SriMesh/Sandbox/NorthSeaIntro]]  They could be further copy edited I am sure, but it provides a starting point to summarize the article or the entire table of contents into the introduction.

==Featured Article candidate yet?==
I'd hate to put any article through the process, but this does look like a featurable article to me, at least. Hats off to all of you. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 23:12, 27 July 2007 (UTC)
:Not quite yet, I feel. i've given the article a quick gander and there are still a few problems:
*Several spelling mistakes, typos and some clumsy english in places, but this is easily solved.
::[[Image:Yes check.svg|20px]] Spelling mistakes corrected via MS word and two grammar fixes.  More needed.[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 05:11, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

*some irrelevance and imbalance. For instance, the Battle of Trafalgar (which wasn't in the North Sea) is mentioned, but the Battle of Copenhagen (which was - just) isn't. Also, the map of the Amber Road isn't relevant, as it is only tangential to the North Sea. The Amber Road has its own article where the map can go.
::[[Image:Yes check.svg|20px]] These sections and images have been replaced. 
*Despite the large number of citations (and isn't ''that'' a pleasure to see for once), there needs to be a few more, especially for the part about the moving islands, which is quite a claim and needs a proper reference.

*Sections on culture and wildlife are missing.

*Some of the redlinks need to be filled.

*It's now 88K, which goes against the [[WP:SIZE]] guidelines. But at least it's finally bigger than [[Loch Ness Monster]] which somebody was moaning about.

*there are probably things that I've missed.

== New infobox image ==

The new infobox image with different parts of the sea labelled is very difficult to read in the article and not easy even at the larger size on the image page itself.  is this just my computer/browser/something else or are other folks having the same problem?  [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 16:04, 30 July 2007 (UTC)
:You need to download the full resolution version, available under the image page just under the picture. By the way, this happens a lot with maps and diagrams on WP, personally I accept it "just one of those things", but perhaps there's room for improvement in the coding? On some sites you can enlarge a picture by moving the mouse over it, but don't ask me how it's done, I know more about [[Myōjin-shō|Japanese undersea volcanoes]] than HTML. [[User:Totnesmartin|Totnesmartin]] 19:34, 30 July 2007 (UTC)


At least two of the labels in the infobox image are incorrect the [[Norwegian Trench]] runs much closer to the coast of Norway, reaching its deepest along Norway's southern coast.  Second, the [[Scapa Flow]] is between several of the [[Orkney Islands]] not northwest of them.  - [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 00:07, 13 November 2007 (UTC)

Why do you use the imperial measure units as default and then the metric as comparasion. This is an international page, so it should be the other way round.

I removed {{tl|infobox lake}} from the article as the infobox is meant for lakes, rather than any "body of water".{{spaced ndash}}User:Docu

:Is there any reason that seas should not use the lake box template since there appears to be no other appropriate template?  if not then it ought to be put back and if so then someone who knows better how they're done should create an info box with the information because its useful to have it in one place at the top and some of it appears nowhere else in the article.  [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]]

The infobox was made for lakes. Recently we removed {{tl|lake project}} banners from a series of sea lochs, mainly because we didn't want infoboxes on these either.
Besides, some of the fields are useful mainly for lakes and descriptions of some fields link to lake specific pages.{{spaced ndash}}User:Docu

== Islands ==
The table in the 'Islands' section isn't sorting properly.

:I guess it is because the table cell content is alphanumeric. Try removing the km<sup>2</sup> to the header and things might work better. It may then be like the [[List of islands of Scotland]] where sorting cycles through forward and backward, numeric and alphanumeric. [[User:Finavon|Finavon]] 17:28, 6 August 2007 (UTC)
Glad that appears to work. Should this list include all the larger islands in the Scottish Orkney and Shetland Groups? I think they are all considered N Sea.

Peer review by a member of [[WP:NL]]
** It is a reasonably good article but I think it is still at B class (not saying anything about GA or FA classes).
** Weaknesses:
*** Introduction is too brief (one paragraph). Also in this brief context the reference to a name long ago out of use seems a bit irrelevant. The images in the introduction section are not fully complementary, an infobox is now becoming standard for many articles so perhaps something like that may work here as well
:[[Image:Yes check.svg|20px]]added another paragraph to intro.  Added infobox for oceans see also above
*** The order of the sections should be considered as I think the current structure does not facilitate a very good flow
*** Naming sections seems a bit at an awkward location and the list at the end of this section disrupts the reading flow

==Languages==
For the size parameter....and for lists to be converted to prose.  Should the languages and culture sub sections be made into a separate article linked to this one?  The new article could be written in prose and not in lists. The image has also been red linked.   [[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 05:24, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:I think both of the long lists--that is the languages and the islands--should be split into seperate pages either lists or as regular articles for someone to improve.  [[User:Jieagles|Jieagles]] 01:06, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

:What happened to the language section? Why was it removed? I think it's very important to emphasise the cultural, not just the geographic role of such seas. In the case of the North Sea, the Germanic languages have more or less evolved around it. --[[User:MacRusgail|MacRusgail]] 17:20, 19 October 2007 (UTC)

::The languages section was moved to its own page called [[List of languages of the North Sea]] which is linked from the See also section.  It was moved, along with the islands list, because the page was very long and the lists lacked the context to make them really useful on the page (in my opinion).  i think that a section on culture and languages would great and would make the link to the list of languages more accessible (right now its at the bottom among all the other lists), but the section consisting just of the list is not as useful.

Criterion 1-3 above are the most critical for [[WP:GA|GA status]], and this article has major shortcomings on all three. First, <Strike>the prose is pretty choppy in many areas, and it's quite evident that the article has been edited by many people, as it doesn't seem to flow quite right in many sections. There's also several run-on sentences and sentences where adding a comma or two would help a lot. So I would think that a good copyedit of this article is in order. The article does mostly meet the [[WP:MOS|manual of style]], with a few exceptions. Mostly, the 'see also' links are not done right{{spaced ndash}}these should be placed at the top of the section, not at the bottom. And I would also avoid listing see also items in a bulleted list when putting them in a section (instead, list each link on one line separated by commas). The 'see also' section at the end is also quite long, and could be pruned{{spaced ndash}}starting with removing any links to articles that already appear in the text above. Also, remove the subheadings for 'articles' and 'lists', and simply list any remaining see also items in alphabetical order.</strike>

With respect to [[WP:V|verifiability]], the article is short on reference citations in many areas. Any key facts and figures, and other information that is likely to be challenged, needs to be cited. <strike>A statement like, "This area contains the world's greatest concentration of industry: 15% of the planet's industrial production takes place in the catchment area of the North Sea." needs to have a source. Also, you need to fix statements like this: "This places the North Sea at the 13th largest sea."{{spaced ndash}}in what? the world? Europe? the arctic? the solar system? Be more specific. </strike>The history section is also seriously lacking in citations as well{{spaced ndash}}there's lots of work today here.

<strike>With regard to criterion 3 (completeness), the article is mostly complete and focused, but it lacks information on the biology & ecology of the north sea. What sorts of aquatic and marine life inhabit the region? The only real mention of this is in the natural resources section, discussing the fishing industry.</strike>

<Strike>The order of sections is reasonably good, though I would consider promoting the history section. It usually comes near the beginning of the article{{spaced ndash}}first or second (in this case, just after 'naming' would be appropriate). Also, consider renaming 'location' to 'geography', as this would be a better and more descriptive title for that section. You also might want to consider combining the 'natural resources' and 'marine traffic' sections into a single 'economy' section, since they all seem to be connected. It's a little bit awkward with a discussion on 'marine traffic' in its own main section at the end, and doesn't quite fit under the section titled, 'natural resources', even though the marine traffic is related to spreading those resources with other markets in the world. So a single 'economy' section would probably be more appropriate here.</strike>

Other than these issues, I think the article is quite good. I think the article can be renominated at [[WP:GAN]] once these issues are addressed. Cheers! [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] ([[User talk:Derek.cashman|talk]]) 17:13, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

[[Image:North Sea.jpg|thumb|right|150px|image in question]]

The geographic descriptions in Image:North Sea.jpg are mostly good, but some are obviously wrong. "Scapa Flow" belongs into the southern part of the Orkney islands, "Pentland Firth" is too far west and ditto "Norwegian trench". Some more may have escaped my attention.

}}
*1490s-1750 (approx) "by definition all [British] external trade with the European mainland was maritime. But so too was much internal trade, not least because of the relatively undeveloped state of the roads beyond the lowlands of England. In particular, therefore, the intra-national trade of England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland was carried on by coastwise shipping, operated from numerous small ports, which were especially developed along the eastern coasts of England and Scotland, in suitable locations for the continental trades, and with inland connections via navigable rivers in a number of cases."
*"In the half century from 1490, English trade was focused on three major regions, which were the outcome of a long period of development dating back to the High Middle Ages. First was the northern European coastlands stretching from the Elbe to Brittany, from whence came wine, salt, domestic goods, linen, dyestuffs and metalware. Second was Scandinavia and the Baltic, the source of imports of timber, naval stores, grain and fish. Thirdly was the Mediterranean, from whence came luxury goods including fruit, spices, dyestuffs and high value cloth. By far the most important export was cloth."
*"A notable maritime feature was the monopolisation of the export trade of the Northern Isles from the mid-fifteenth century onwards by itinerant Hanseatic merchants based mainly in Hamburg and Bremen"
*(early 16th cent) "Even at this early stage the Low Countries and German lands may be seen as a central economic focus, with the Spanish Netherlands as a crucial piece of empire providing the link with the then dominant political and military power in Europe and overseas. Just how important this was is demonstrated by the collapse of the banking system after 1550, and the decline of Antwerp in the later sixteenth century. Antwerp had by then not only replaced Seville as the principal port of the Spanish Empire, but was the great entrepot for European trade." Antwerp being Spain's major port would be a DYK if this article were a stub.
*1600-1650s "Meanwhile in northern waters the Dutch expanded their herring fishing to a peak by mid-century, and also developed the cod and whale fisheries" (not sure where the fishing grounds were, but N Sea was the route)
*"The second half of the seventeenth century was dominated by the conflict between England and Holland, in terms of ideas, economic competition and naval warfare. ... England emerged as the dominant maritime power in north west Europe at the end of the seventeenth century, as Dutch sea power declined."
*"by 1805, Trafalgar finally sealed the maritime supremacy of the Royal Navy, and ushered in the Pax Britannica at sea, which lasted until 1916 and the Battle of Jutland."
*"... in this post-1700 evolution, Scotland was a leading country in its own right during the industrial revolution stage, the period of the Scottish Enlightenment ... including the establishment of a great herring fishing, in which it became the European leader during the third long wave from the 1870s onwards" --[[User:Philcha|Philcha]] ([[User talk:Philcha|talk]]) 16:52, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

*The article is based mainly on paleomagnetic data, i.e. comparing the directions of magnetic fields in rocks of similar age, including working the locations of these rocks to the magnetic poles at the time. The bulk of the results are of Late Carboniferous–Early Triassic and Early Tertiary age - suitable Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks are rare, and geological activity in Europe at the time (e.g. microplate movements and formation of the Alps) has makes the European ones hard to interpret.
*On more detailed reading I find that the Torsvik ''et al'' article is about the continental plates, which include their continental shelves, and says nothing about the N Sea as a functioning sea.

==Geology section==
Hi, there were requests for help with the geological section in this article on different pages. As a geologist, I would like to help, but when I read the section it is incomprehensible for me. I just don't know how to start. So I will just tell here where the current text puzzles me:

''The bed of the North Sea forms two basins.'' -> does it mean a sedimentary/geologic basin? The definition of that is an area where nett sedimentation takes place. The entire North Sea plus some of its surroundings is one large sedimentary/geologic basin. There can't be two separate basins there. I guess the text means there are two old basins in the subsurface of the North Sea?
:I think that this sentence refers to [[North_Sea_Geological_History#Cretaceous_era_sea_floor_spreading|the Cretaceous era]] as this is the citation used [http://jgs.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/131/5/435 Review of North Sea Basin development abstract].  [[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:08, 24 November 2008 (UTC)
::{{done}} removed from the article on the [[North Sea]] and left in the [[North_Sea_Geological_History#Cretaceous_era_sea_floor_spreading|Cretaceous era of the North Sea Geological History]]

''The larger, northern one lies to the north of a ridge between Norfolk and Frisia, and had its origin in the Devonian Period. The southern basin, if not flooded, would drain towards the Strait of Dover and thence to the English Channel. This basin dates from the Carboniferous Period.'' -> there must be an anachronism here since the English Channel, Strait of Dover, Norfolk and Frisia are all recent entities, formed in the last 10.000 years. The Carboniferous was 300.000.000 years ago and has nothing to do with those features. How a Devonian basin can drain into a present day sea is a mystery, geologically spoken, this is nonsense.
:I cannot find the citation in the article for this, nor anything also in any sources I read.  This will have to be adjusted.[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:08, 24 November 2008 (UTC)
::{{done}} removed entirely.


''Imaging and analysis have suggested that this southern basin has several times been a lake bed hemmed in by glaciers in the north and a land bridge between Britain and France at Dover in the southwest. Around 400,000 years ago, the chalk barrier holding the large lake back from the land bridge was breached and the water swiftly eroded huge swaths of the land bridge.'' -> hmmm, now this must be about fairly recent (Quarternary) events again, yet they can't be about the old subsurfacial basins. Is the current North Sea Basin meant?
:Here I believe you are right, but the North Sea article is not well worded.  It is I am assuming summarizing this article [[Strait_of_Dover#Geological_formation|Strait of Dover formation]][[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:08, 24 November 2008 (UTC)
::{{done}} Removed entirely and referred to the [[Strait of Dover]]


''The process repeated itself during a later ice age about 180,000 years ago, permanently connecting the North Sea with the Atlantic in the south.'' -> as far as I know, Great Britain was again connected with continental Europe during the last glacials (Weichselian/Devensian and Saalian/Wolstonian). The website of the Guardian is not really a very trustworthy source for this type of information so I presume this view isn't the scientific consensus on the subject.

:I understand, this belongs to the information above.[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:08, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

The third alinea is an anecdote, it should be fitted into a yet non-existing general line on the sea's development during the late Holocene.

The second paragraph is rubbish I'm afraid. Unrelated facts are summarized in one alinea. Why is it called plate tectonics when it is on tectonics? As a geologist I would expect something on the structure and infill/stratigraphy of the Triassic/Jurassic grabens, Cretaceous inversion, and Tertiary reactivation. Which structures are currently active? I'm not sure if Avalonia belongs here at all. What are the recent quakes doing here?
:Thank you, this paragraph does not really summarise the allness of the history of the North Sea geology.  Could you also look over [[North Sea Geological History]] so it can be properly summarised into the article as I am not sure if the above three items (infill/stratigraphy of the Triassic/Jurassic grabens, Cretaceous inversion, and Tertiary reactivation) which you have mentioned are introduced properly in the supposed ''fuller, more developed'' article which I attempted at [[North Sea Geological History]].[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:08, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

== Useless level of detail ==

In most contexts, it makes no sense to use coordinates like "roughly between {{coord|53|30|00|N|0|3|0|E|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Broad Fourteens North east}} and {{coord|52|30|00|N|4|30|0|E|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Broad Fourteens South west}}" or such. That level of detail is distracting and totally useless. Unfortunately, there are quite a few on Wikipedia who don't agree and insist on measuring mountain ranges, shoals, deserts etc by the metre, which is physically impossible and can be read as a demonstration of ignorance on the part of the author. Please let us avoid this. 

Similarly, conversions of units like "50,000 square kilometres (289,576.62 sq mi)[1] with a volume of around 94,000 cubic kilometres (22,553.65 cu mi)" are useless. A converted measurement can never be more accurate that the original. Thanks, [[User:Kosebamse|Kosebamse]] ([[User talk:Kosebamse|talk]]) 07:58, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

:I agree 99.9354692%. Unfortunately this is just one instance of a general problem that is not yet being generally discussed (that I am aware of). Our sources are often not prepared by scientists and make implicit claims of absurd precision, such as determining the population of a country in a given ''year'' up to a a single person, often even without basing this on a census. Some editors think that rounding such numbers sensibly is "original research" and therefore not allowed. The conversions are a slightly different problem, because they are normally done automatically. I believe with the current software it is not possible to ensure that the conversion templates do sensible rounding. By the way, Wikipedia is at least not the only reference work that suffers from such problems. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] ([[User talk:Hans Adler|talk]]) 10:34, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

::There must be a convention or policy somewhere to regulate use of measurements. There can be no doubt about the factual side of it (highschool level science), but alas, generally agreed-on fundamentals of science are often not good enough for Wikipedia, so we'll need to find the appropriate place to point to. Any idea? [[User:Kosebamse|Kosebamse]] ([[User talk:Kosebamse|talk]]) 10:43, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

:::The third item in [[WP:MOSNUM#Large numbers]] is relevant. I think one of the reasons why this is not generally observed is that it can easily lead to absurd conflicts that are hard to resolve. "The population of Foobarrington is 192,523" is a no-brainer if that's what the source says. And it avoids edit wars between the inhabitants of Foobarrington ("The population of Foobarrington is 200,000") and their jealous neighbours ("The population of Foobarrington is 190,000"). Don't laugh. I have seen the edit wars about the population of Leeds. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] ([[User talk:Hans Adler|talk]]) 16:53, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

== History subheaders ==

The change I made from "20th century" to "Modern era" was done in order to include the 21st century.  The change from "Early modern history" to "Early modern period" both reduces redundancy of the word "history" in header/subheaders, and correlates with the classification of [[early modern period]]. However, early modern period commonly ends around 1800, while this section currently covers the period ending with the start of WWI. I don't know that this is a problem, but it needs a second look. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 16:22, 10 December 2008 (UTC)
:As the Name section appears to be historical context of the name, I moved it into History. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 21:09, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

== Mistake in map ==
The map in history section showing viking age expansion is wrong. The norse settlement, which from the [[iron age]] developed to the viking age, was well established further north along the Norwegian coast well before the 8th century. See [http://www.vestreg.no/MmV/eng/steder/bogard.htm this] article about several iron age farms on [[Andøya]] in [[Vesterålen]] There are lots of iron age archeological evidence from [[Lofoten]], see [[Lofotr]] viking museum, where a continous development from iron age to viking age is evident. There is even some evidence of bronze age agricultural society north of the arctic circle, as in [[Steigen]].[[User:Orcaborealis|Orcaborealis]] ([[User talk:Orcaborealis|talk]]) 18:34, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

==Layout==
There is a problem with the layout that needs addressing. The map at the start of the Geography section ends up sandwiched between the "Submarine topography" Dogger bank image and the co-ordinate list/image when the contents are hidden. Probably the co-ordinates & image need moving down the article somewhere to avoid problems when the TOC is collapsed. [[User:Keith D|Keith D]] ([[User talk:Keith D|talk]]) 00:57, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

== Footnotes ==

== Geirangerfjord - is it the North Sea or Norwegian Sea? ==
According to the map used for illustrating exclusive economic zones, Geirangerfjord is too far north for being in the North Sea. [[User:Orcaborealis|Orcaborealis]] ([[User talk:Orcaborealis|talk]]) 17:22, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

==Citations and references==
Hello there.  Please if you are helping and editing the North Sea article, leave existing references in the text, or add references to support the text.  This note is added, as the "Name" section was entirely referenced, and now all the citations are mysteriously gone. So this section needs to be re-done with referential look ups and citation templates all over again.  Only the lead can be without references because the lead just repeats the facts and info from all sections of the article, and the citations, therefore are in the article, and not needed two times in the article for the same fact.  Thank you very much for your cooperation, and for any and all help in this regards.  Kind Regards [[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 05:54, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

:::Ah!  I will read over the pages cited in that discussion, but will continue citing this North Sea article as many sections are now complete, and the unverifiable content is being removed, and refs are given for whatever content I can make stay.

==Name section==
Some time ago the name section was a little more comprehenensive. I think keeping a little explanation on ''mare germanicum'' and the current name would be ideal.  The details could be expanded at the article on history. [[User:Inwind|Inwind]] ([[User talk:Inwind|talk]]) 11:27, 17 January 2009 (UTC)
:I have tried to keep the original text as much as possible.  Articles on wikipedia need to be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verified]] via [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations and references]].  I looked and looked for more information about some of the naming items, and the references were limited.  I will continue personally referencing the remainder of the North Sea article for the [[Wikipedia:Good article criteria|GA criteria]], and return again to the name section.  If you can find a [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable citation or reference]] to expand the name section, that would be simply awesome.

==Some suggestions==
{{Resolved}}
*Surprisingly, the lead section lacks '''any''' references.[[User:Smallman12q|Smallman12q]] ([[User talk:Smallman12q|talk]]) 02:41, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
**The lead sections of articles do not usually contain references as per manual of style Someone put a fact needed tag here.  [[Wikipedia:Lead_section#Citations|Lead paragraphs]] usually paraphrase information placed in the prose elsewhere in the article, and it is redundant to reference the same info twice.  The lead is just an intro to information contained elsewhere, and has no new content in it.  [[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:28, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
*Perhaps this should be added to the Wikiproject Europe?[[User:Smallman12q|Smallman12q]] ([[User talk:Smallman12q|talk]]) 02:42, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
::Yes, add the banner if you wish.[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]]
*There should be a picture for the birds and biodiversity section. (Its great that there is an image for nearly every section.)

*This article needs some copy edit...for example... civilisation should be civilization. (Wikipedia follows the american standard).
**No.  Articles must follow a [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English|pattern again as per wikipedia M of S]]. This article was initally written in ''British English'' syle, and all American spellings removed.  It must be one or the other but not both.  This already has been corrected to be only one style, do not mix up again.  
*A link for an image gallery of the North Sea.
::NO.  Adding a commons category link is OK, and already is used. Usually [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Visual_arts/Art_Manual_of_Style#Galleries|galleries]] aare only used in articles about visual themes such as the art of somebody...and they get tagged if they have a gallery in them if they are nnot that type of article.[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:28, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
 
:The default for leads is no refs - the lead should sumarise the main text, which should contain the refs. Very occasionally the lead may containa ref for a point that is surpising or may be thought controversial.
:WP allows both American and Britsh usage (tho not in the same article) and recommends the variant that is most appropriate to the nationality of the subject. AFAIK the N Sea is not currently part of the USA. --[[User:Philcha|Philcha]] ([[User talk:Philcha|talk]])
::I think perhaps we could double reference the numbers for the size of the North Sea in the lead, but it doesn't need too much repeat referencing.  As for the spelling, Philcha is right; this article should use British English. Wikipedia does not have a preference for American English, and in fact according to the subsection of [[Wikipedia:ENGVAR]] titled [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Strong_national_ties_to_a_topic]], uses a variety of English appropriate for the article with consistency and consensus in mind. Geographically and politically speaking, the North Sea is not a part of the United States and using American English would not be appropriate (except for official titles like the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]). I think a picture of a representative endangered species would be nice in the '''Biodiversity and conservation''' as suggested  --[[User:Jh12|Jh12]] ([[User talk:Jh12|talk]]) 03:46, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

::::If you find mismatches, please point them out or correct them. Finally, I think the need for citations should be reviewed on a case by case basis, or the lead rewritten.  There should not be a lot of excess citations in the lead; it is designed to be a general overview per [[Wikipedia:Lead#Citations]].  Look at the last three [[WP:Featured articles]], Wikipedia's best work: [[300 (film)]], [[Buildings and architecture of Bristol]], [[Toa Payoh ritual murders]].

::::::References should be in the lead paragraph per [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]. As for no citations...the WP policy reads ''".

:::::::Again, this isn't about WP:VER; this is about the lead section.  Today's featured article [[Romeo and Juliet]] again contains only a single footnote.  I don't have any problems with adding a reference or two, but it should be limited.

:Hello there, you raise a valid point about applying references and putting facts into articles.  As I, personally, have not measured the North Sea, I must rely on a source.  When I find a difference in between sources, I sometimes quote both in text, such as Jones says this and Smith says this with both citations following.  Sometimes, I check to see which article seems more reliable in authors or their sources.  In this case, I have used the MUMM article [http://www.mumm.ac.be/EN/NorthSea/facts.php]  other places in the text of the article myself.  You may place several sources and their findings here on the talk page of the North Sea article and then perhaps from this a consensus can be reached on the width.  If there can be no consensus amidst articles the width measurement can be removed.[[User:SriMesh|SriMesh]] | [[User talk:SriMesh|<small>talk</small>]] 03:33, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
