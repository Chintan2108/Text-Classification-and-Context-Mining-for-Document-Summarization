==Balance of payments deficit?==
I am of the understanding that a balance of payments always sums to 0, and that the sentence should thus be changed to read current account deficit. I'm no economist though, so seeking a second opinion.  [[User:Smazza|Smazza]] ([[User talk:Smazza|talk]]) 14:30, 2 January 2012 (UTC)

==Schools of thought supporting the gold standard==

The article mentions "The return to a gold standard is supported by many followers of the Austrian School, Objectivists, libertarians,[7] largely because they object to the role of the elected government in issuing fiat currency through central banks." 

The source does not provide the kind of evidence that would justify mentioning "many followers" of the very broad schools of Objectivism (an ethical philosophy with economic implications that are not at all necessarily supportive of the gold standard) and Libertarianism (a political philosophy based on personal freedoms and a free market economic system of capitalism, not gold standards). 

If an adequate citation can be presented that suggests a sizable portion of either of these schools (in an international sense, not only reflecting the nature of specifically American adherents) advocates the gold standard and that it is relevant to the central concepts of their philosophies, then I think they should be added in. Until then I think it's best the article not list them.

;; Currently it's illegal to use gold to pay for something in the United States. Ron Paul merely wants to treat gold as money (as it has been for thousands of years) and make gold legal tender as a legitimate competitor to the dollar. He favors a currency backed by something, but has never really pushed the issue of a gold standard because he knows it can't happen in the current economic climate. Peter Schiff was Ron Paul's economic adviser in 2008, having warned about the economic collapse, and both men share a similar record for getting it right even when the idiots that criticize them repeatedly turn out to be horribly wrong. Libertarian economic policy is largely based on the idea of 'sound money', which need not be tied to gold, but should at least be tied to something of intrinsic value (could also be silver and other precious metals). I think a lot of progressives and conservatives alike have misunderstood Ron Paul's economic beliefs; he doesn't actually use term 'gold standard' very often (certainly not as much as he mentions 'sound money').

==Wars don't cause inflation==
"By the early 1970s, as the Vietnam War accelerated inflation", war doesn't cause inflation. Printing more money causes the existing money to inflate, lowering the value of all the currency. This statement doesn't seem correct. [[User:Packetdrop|Packetdrop]] ([[User talk:Packetdrop|talk]]) 00:38, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

–I won't pretend to be an authority, but there are certainly many other means by which inflation increases beyond the printing of physical currency. In this instance the US involvement in Vietnam required the Federal Government to spend money on the war effort (produce arms and other supplies, pay wages, etc). War is expensive so the Government engages in deficit spending. This means more capital is injected into the market, devaluing the dollar, and increasing inflation. [[User:Emancipated|Emancipated]] ([[User talk:Emancipated|talk]]) 08:01, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
::Inflation is the act of increasing the supply of money and/or credit.

:::Although that's sometimes the colloquial understanding, inflation is supposed to refer to an increase in price levels. Which can happen with or without monetary expansion. There have actually been periods of deflation while the money supply has been expanding before, and vice versa. This is actually the cause of most hyperinflation - they weren't actually increasing the Zimbabwean money supply by thousands of percentage points ever day; that would be impossible. People began to view the currency as increasingly worthless, and would only accept a ridiculous amount of it in exchange for anything. Although the inflation was set off by printing money, once it had started it continued on its own, and little could stop it.[[Special:Contributions/98.95.154.85|98.95.154.85]] ([[User talk:98.95.154.85|talk]]) 18:44, 16 June 2011 (UTC)
::::No, inflation is the increase in the money supply.  Rising prices are the effect of inflation, they are not inflation itself.  By pretending that inflation is a price phenomenon and not a manipulatin of the money supply, the central banks deflect public anger from the banks who are inflating the money, to the merchants who raise their prices to cope with the devaluation of the money. This misunderstanding has allowed governments to pretend that inflation is some kind of mysterious phenomenon over which they have no control, when in fact it is, and has always been a policy.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.103.102.240|76.103.102.240]] ([[User talk:76.103.102.240|talk]]) 14:59, 26 July 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==Based on Pseudo Economics==

This whole article is based on pseudo economics such as the Austrian School. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and we cannot use pseudo sciences and studies to back up arguments. The Austrian School does not us mathematical tools of analysis, does not believe in many of the core precepts of economics and is based on broad assumptions. It is therefore akin to a belief. I suggest that we delete large part of this page and stick to the historical narrative. Leave the economics to the Economic History of the United States or the Economic History of the 20th Century.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/65.24.133.184|65.24.133.184]] ([[User talk:65.24.133.184|talk]]) 23:03, 20 February 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

If in doubt, toss the word/words 'pseudo' into the title, and then for extra measure toss in 'pseudo-science' to appeal to a consensus rather than any hard evidence. Your rant has more to do with frustration from your own ignorance concerning Austrian economics (which is nothing more than a commonality toward supply-and-demand economics) and general economics then it does about the article and it's alleged non-objectivity.

=="Later Ramifications" ==
The "Later Ramifications" section of this article is terrible. While the argument could be, and admittedly has been, made that the removal of the Bretton-Woods system did indeed have some part in causing the events of 2007-2009, you would be hard pressed to find a significant number of economists willing to make this point. It would be far more appropriate to include it in a section entitled "Criticism," or, better yet, included in the Bretton Woods article rather than here. I've removed it, as I feel uncomfortable with the current near factual status accorded to it by its position, feel free to revert and fix it if you think anything can be salvaged.

I'm not debating that this is indeed a minority opinion among a certain kind of economist -- I won't go into why I think this has more to do with a specific political viewpoint, and how that viewpoint tends to ignore the many tangible benefits that arose from the removal of the Bretton-Woods system, as much of that is probably covered on the Bretton-Woods page. I do, however, contest the inclusion of this minority viewpoint on a low traffic page where the majority viewpoint is not given similar billing.

If the section were rewritten to indicate that this is but one of many theories as to the cause of the recent crisis, that if it were a cause, it would only be a minor one, and that much of the material for that claim is from an extremely limited (and, in the opinion of another, much larger group of economists, theoretically suspect) number of sources, I'd be much happier. 

However, I'm still of the opinion that the better solution would be for this section to be removed, and for it to instead include a blurb saying "According to some economists, the removal of the Bretton-Woods system was one of many precipitating elements in the Financial Crisis of 2007-2009," with a link to these higher traffic pages where a more complete summary of both sides could be provided. To put it plainly, there's no reason for a debate of monetary theory -- as complex a subject as you can find in economics -- to be occurring on a page concerned with a non-standard historical term. Especially when it's a biased portrayal of the debate!

:While I spent a lot of time bitching about the quality of the section, it's unrelated to my primary point -- that this, as criticism of B/W's role in the current financial crisis, would be better served appearing either on pages about B/W or the current financial crisis, or even on both. It has nothing to do with a definitional article on what the historical (and rather dated) term Nixon Shock means, and shouldn't appear here. Do you have some sort of compelling rational as to why it should?

:And no, I don't have on-hand any scholarly articles to point to. In point of fact, I could probably look all day and not find any scholarly articles on why B/W isn't all that relevant to the crisis. B/W's removal is just a thundering non-issue that wouldn't pop into anyone's mind, least of all when you'd be hard pressed to even begin to explain how exchange rates were relevant to a crisis that had its origin in poorly understood securitization markets, and the sudden and complete liquidity collapse that emerged from a failure in those markets. Maybe something about an undervalued (vs dollar) RMB/Yuan aiding in the creation of an unwieldy bilateral trade imbalance that made possible the transfer of cheap money from China to America, thereby fueling the crisis. But that is A) a bit of a stretch and B) if true, 'fuel on the fire' rather than an outright cause and C) unlikely, because B/W fell apart over a similar but far less heated argument. But, as I said, I see no reason to out and out remove it from Wikipedia entirely -- just that it be moved to a more appropriate location than an article on an infrequently used term (of doubtful provenance) for a historical event.

<br/>
Though I think that the focus on sources is great, this misses that the argument about ramifications is inferential, not theoretical.  One could probably find scholarly papers on the effectiveness of using horoscopes to predict market outcomes, but that hardly makes this kind of work worthy of mention.  The reason why the closing of the gold window is relevant to today's recession is that it allowed the US fed to print much more money than it previously could.  The article itself indicates this when recalling that earlier attempts at overprinting were halted by demands for convertibility -- this is what precipitated the shock after all.  Furthermore, it is quite universally accepted that the present recession was brought on by sustained ease of credit and investment into unprofitable enterprise, heavy leveraging, etc.  The root cause of these is, undisputedly, easy money from the fed.  The link is not some hypothesis, it is equivalent to saying that flooding is caused by an excess of water.  Too much money now, and a decision made in the 70s to allow the printing of virtually unlimited amounts of it.  One does not need to cite sources to make such an obvious connection.  And the section title is horrible, it should be something like "Controversy" or "Criticism" [[Special:Contributions/173.34.55.254|173.34.55.254]] ([[User talk:173.34.55.254|talk]]) 04:25, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

I've recently been irritated by this section of the article as well. Listen, if your going to extensively quote a Marxist scholar using materialistic dialectic, you should either 1) type that David McNally is a Marxist scholar of the New Socialist Group (something to the effect "According to Marxist scholar") or 2) add other fringe views of economists. I'm not partial to 2) because then we would have to include the views of goldbugs, anarcho-capitalists, Objectivists, Austrian school economists, freshwater/Chicago school economists, saltwater economists, the history of why the US didn't go off the gold standard sooner, what various ecnomists of history thought of the gold standard, who in the various political discourses throughout the world look at the end of the gold standard as the end of civilization (a group I thought was limited to goldbugs and Austrian schoolers). The problem with this is it is beyond the scope of this article as a whole. Just about every major economy is off the gold standard now and is using a fiat currency. For "Later Ramifications", maybe just link to "fiat  currencies" where this debate could properly take place. As of now, it sounds like David McNally is expressing mainstream economic/political thought, when I cannot think of an academic economist (even in the Chicago school) who believes this. It's fundamentally misleading to the reader. My suggestion: Either rename this section "Controversy" and point out this is Marxist thinking or just delete the section entirely.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/209.2.222.241|209.2.222.241]] ([[User talk:209.2.222.241|talk]]) 14:21, 20 July 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== West Gemany ==

''In May 1971, inflation-wary West Germany was the first member country to leave the Bretton Woods system — unwilling to deflate the Deutsche Mark to prop up the dollar.[1]  In order to prevent the dumping of the Deutsche Mark on the open market, West Germany did not consult with the international monetary community before making the change. In the next three months, West Germany’s move strengthened their economy; simultaneously, the dollar dropped 7.5% against the Deutsche Mark.[1]''

I am not an expert, but there seems to be some contradiction (or unclarity?) in these two sentences. Was Germany afraid of deflation (of the Deutschmark) or inflation? Did leaving Bretton Woods result in deflation or inflation?

I could see no way to fix this other than deleting the final phrase. But I am uncertain whether it is true that "other currencies were fixed to the dollar" or whether they were pegged to the dollar, so someone with more knowledge than I needs to look at this.

I found a very clear indication on the Wiki page titled "the History of the United States Dollar that the result of Bretton Woods was that other currencies were pegged to the dollar (not "fixed") so I went ahead and made the change.

== DEFAULT ==

Why is there no paragraph calling what the US did in 1971 as the biggest ever known sovereign default in the history of capitalism? There is a lot of literature and economists out there calling it with what this was. Can we please get more transparency even if it hurts to certain POV pushers?

== How does "monetary inflation" cause the inflated money to become "over valued"? ==

Quoting from the article: "and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued in the 1960s".  How can increasing the supply of a currency cause it to be overvalued?  [[Special:Contributions/206.72.58.57|206.72.58.57]] ([[User talk:206.72.58.57|talk]]) 02:21, 13 May 2019 (UTC)
