== "Intent to destroy" missing from lede – proposal to add ==

One of the most common misuses of term ''genocide'' in the media is ignorance or amnesia with respect to the "'''intent'''" part of the definition. The naive understanding is that, if a genocidal doesn't annihilate a group, that it somehow was "not genocide". For example, someone might believe, "Because there are Native Americans alive today, the United States did not eliminate all the Native American population, therefore the U.S.A. cannot be [[Genocide_of_indigenous_peoples#The_question_of_colonization_and_genocide_in_the_Americas|guilty of genocide against the Native Americans]]." This logic is incorrect, as the definition shows; the burden of proving genocide is to prove '''the intent to destroy…''' which is quite different than total destruction.  I move that we should specifically include the word "'''intent'''" in the lede, as its a key part of the definition and is probably the most commonly misunderstood aspect of genocide among non-scholars.

== The term genocide was coined in response the Armenian Genocide ? ==

This sentence seems dubious "The term genocide was coined in response the Armenian Genocide", the OED gives the origin of the term as 1940's. The first source says "..when Raphael Lemkin coined the word genocide in 1944 he cited the 1915 annihilation of Armenians as a seminal example of genocide". Taking 29 years to coin a term hardly qualifies as 'a response', neither is citing the 'Armenian Genocide' as an example, the same as coining the term as 'a response' I know the sources refer to attempts by Lemkin to get 'crimes against groups',  recognised before 1944, but if no published use of the term existed before 1944, the term simply did not exist before then. 

Another source used states explicitly "in the course of his monumental study ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe,'' the late Raphael Lemkin coined the word genocide - from the Greek genos (race or tribe) and the Latin cide (killing) - to describe the deliberate ''destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group.'' The concept was catching, and in December 1946 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution recognizing genocide as a ''crime under international law'' … … ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'' doesn't sound much like 'the Armenian Genocide'! [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 00:14, 1 February 2017 (UTC)
:Indeed, that struck me as being a change in contravention to [[WP:NOR]]. The history and background of Lemkin's interests are [[WP:OFFTOPIC]] for the scope of this article (and can be argued out on his bio, or on the definitions of genocide article), but the only matter of concern here is that it was coined by him, then adopted by the UN. No, the ''Axis Rule'' was certainly not the recognition of the term on the strength of a genocide which took place over 20 years earlier. To draw such a conclusion is [[WP:SYNTH]] and should be omitted. --[[User:Iryna Harpy|Iryna Harpy]] ([[User talk:Iryna Harpy|talk]]) 00:33, 6 February 2017 (UTC)
::I feel that perhaps the best course of action here is for any editor who has the time (not me at the moment, I'm afraid) to read ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'' and to see what Lemkin said therein about the origin of the term. Specifically, did he describe its coinage as being (akin to) a response to the Armenian genocide, or not? If so, then this should be cited in the article. If not, then that part of the article should perhaps be rewritten appropriately. [[User:Zazpot|zazpot]] ([[User talk:Zazpot|talk]]) 01:36, 6 February 2017 (UTC)

:::I actually came here precisely to clarify when/how the term was coined and was a bit surprised by the claim and agree that it is SYNTH. I wasn't sufficiently certain of the true picture to make the edit myself at that time. I also agree that precisely how Lemkin evolved his views over many years is a detail for the biog page. 'Armenia' is an example of the newly coined term, one of a number I believe in his book, but the term was not coined as 'a response' to Armenia. Unless there were an absolutely unequivocal statement from Lemkin that it was such a response, we have to go with what 2ndary sources are saying, which is that it was an example.

:::I'm prepared to try and make the edit, however what I'm a bit unsure of at present is where Nazi racial policies in occupied Europe, and specifically the holocaust fit into the 'coinage' narrative, ''(ie were these the primary subject of Lemkin's book, which the book title suggests, were they also examples, if not how did they fit into Lemkin's account?)''. Alternatively we could simply avoid characterising ANY relationship between Lemkin's coinage and these events/policies. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 16:40, 6 February 2017 (UTC)
:::::I have tried to clarify this.  It is important that Lemkin's motivation to dedicate his whole life to working against mass murder is mentionned. Power makes it clear that he was motivated by his observation  of the Holocaust as well. Philippe Sands book gives even more reference to this.  I have tried to reduce the books to those most directly related to Lemkin's motivation. [[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 12:10, 7 February 2017 (UTC) p. 77 in "Axis Rule.." is but one example of the influence of Nazi mass murders on him. [[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 12:22, 7 February 2017 (UTC)

::::::There is little doubt that what you say is true about Lemkin's 'life work', which went beyond 'physical' destruction of peoples, to encompass intentional 'cultural' destruction. However that kind of detail probably belongs on 'his' article, and the book article. What is relevant here is the meaning and genesis of the term, expressed accurately and succinctly. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 15:39, 7 February 2017 (UTC)

:::::::[[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]], I don't object to your edits on first look, since they relate to Lemkin's lifelong interests ''(which are RS'd )'', rather than to coinage of the term, which is much more blurred, but which is clearly in a book about Nazi policies. A detail is that other mass murders, apart from 'Armenian', were also referred to by Lemkin in that book. I hope we agree about the context of coinage, but that no specific event(s) led solely, directly to the coinage. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 12:02, 9 February 2017 (UTC)

:::::::I'm still unhappy about the wording of the lead, which still implies that the word was coined to describe Armenian killings. Can we agree that the word was coined in a book describing Nazi practices/policies in occupied Europe ''(many of these events and practices have since acquired their own terms, such as Holocaust, but Lemkin does not use these terms nor identify/classify the specific events in the way that they have been classified post-WWII)''. 

:::::::Lemkin's book cites examples from history including 'Armenia', other 'Ottoman' massacres, Tsarist and E. European pogroms etc.. 

:::::::Lemkin had a lifelong interest in crimes against peoples, which he himself attributes to learning about the Armenian killings as a young man in the late 1920's, an interest which he pursued through other mass actions against peoples.

:::::::I believe all three of these is true and RS'd, what I don't accept is that the word was coined specifically to describe 'Armenia', nor indeed any specific event(s), though the strongest contender would have to be 'Nazi crimes'.

(Sands, Philippe (2016). East West Street : on the origins of "Genocide" and "Crimes Against Humanity”. Chapter 72)  He also referred to the Armenian events in his article in the American Scholar (Volume 15, no. 2 (April 1946), p. 227-230)  [[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 20:28, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
::::::::I have a simpler suggestion, but it's late now and my brain hurts! On a side-note, I found several other articles claiming/implying that those incidents solely prompted coinage of the term! [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 22:44, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
:::::::::[[User:92slim|92slim]] please read ''(and join)'' this discussion. Sources do not state that Lemkin 'coined the term in response' to any single event, and you can't equate Lemkin's use of 'Nazi war crimes in Europe' with the Holocaust, since he is referring to many war crimes OTHER than even the broader use of 'Holocaust' ''(ie including Roma etc)''. Lemkin is clear that what was being done to the Jews and to Poles, Russians and other E. Europeans was more brutal than what was happening in W. Europe, but the book is about ALL 'crimes against peoples' in occupied Europe and the term was coined in a book about those crimes. Lemkin did become interested in the subject initially because of hearing about Armenia, and he does cite Armenia ''(and several other examples)'' as 'classic examples' but he coined the term nearly twenty years after first becoming interested in what happened in Armenia and in a different context. Let's find a way to represent all this clearly and succinctly. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 22:50, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
::::::::::92slim can't join the discussion due to being blocked. But I agree with you. [[User:El_C|El_C]] 22:55, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
:::::::::::{{ping|Pincrete}}, {{ping|El_C}} Note, I'm only here because I've been editing at [[Armenian Genocide]] and [[Armenian Genocide denial]] lately and am not taking a stance here either way, but various sources do state that he coined it ''mostly'' due to witnessing the Armenian Genocide. I can't access his autobiography through my University but it's supposedly on page 19-20. When Lemkin coined it the full scale of the [[Holocaust]] was not yet common knowledge, but he was obviously already drawing parellels. Example from [https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008187 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]: "The origin of the term ''genocide'' and its codification in international law have their roots in the mass murder of Armenians in 1915–16. Lawyer Raphael Lemkin, the coiner of the word and later its champion at the United Nations, repeatedly stated that early exposure to newspaper stories about Ottoman crimes against Armenians was key to his beliefs about the need for legal protection of groups (a core element in the UN Genocide Convention of 1948)." [[User:Prinsgezinde|Bataaf van Oranje (Prinsgezinde)]] ([[User talk:Prinsgezinde|talk]]) 10:39, 10 April 2017 (UTC)

I think it is widely recognised that Lemkin's interest in the subject of 'crimes against peoples' was first aroused by various  incidents, notably Armenia. But the term was not coined in respomse to that event. nor any single event, but the context of coinage is 'WWII crimes' ''(and not specifically those against Jews, nor against E Europe)''. 

There are several 'historical' ''(ie pre-WWII)'' examples given in Lemkin's book, inc Armenia and various C19th pogroms. Many WP articles, on the basis of being given by Lemkin as examples, claimed to be the origin of the term. I'm afraid NONE of them are.

:It's an interesting subject for discussion, however, for the purposes of this article, trying to draw our own conclusions remains OR and SYNTH.

::If you read law review, they dont care about anything before it was defined as a crime. Makes things easier. [[User:Seraphim System|Seraphim System]] ([[User talk:Seraphim System|talk]]) 22:46, 10 April 2017 (UTC)
:::Lemkin did not invent genocide, he coined a new term for already existing acts. An act of genocide would have been a crime under existing laws before the term genocide was coined and defined as a crime. For example, it was the opinion of the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal in its examination of the Armenian Genocide that the 1948 International Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was formally expressing an already existing prohibition. So I think that the term "genocide" can, if sourced, be reasonably applied to all modern-era (mid to late 19th century and onward) acts of genocide (because the acts would have been prohibited by existing laws). Further back than that and any assertions of genocide would require much stronger sourcing, not just one-off claims by lobbyists or activists.

::::{{ping|Iryna Harpy}} {{ping|Tiptoethrutheminefield}} Do you know what law review is? There are many articles on Wikipedia, on many different topics. This is a law article.

::::From what [[User talk:Tiptoethrutheminefield]] said above, there may be more sources to add about this. Searching HeinOnline for "genocide retroactively lemkin" yields several on-topic articles. The fact that genocide as a legal definition has been applied retroactively is not a legally trivial matter, and has been discussed in several law review articles. 
::::When trying to make a difficult, technical subject accessible or "easier" for readers I rely on the best sources I have available.

==Native American Genocide==
 We plan to add to the already existing article on Genocide. We plan to add a section about Native American genocide. In this section we will discuss how genocide has been carried out against these indigenous people for hundreds of years in North America. This topic will span from early American History to modern day issues. The sources listed below are the ones we will use to build our writing.

::[[User:Mbrennan8|Mbrennan8]], I agree with Meamemg, in general I would say that there is already too much detail on this article about individual instances, which pretty much all have their own articles.

That the Native American deaths generally meet the bar for genocide is at best debatable; the requirement of intentional destruction was not generally met.  The "Genocide and American Indian History" source cited covers this in some detail.  I'd suggest that the section, as-written, isn't an accurate representation of the mainstream understanding of the situation.  From what I can tell, this section is a student project that has, as a thesis, that the situation was genocide...and I'm not sure that the "start with a thesis, then argue in favor of the position" is the most-reasonable way to go about covering material for an encyclopedia.

:Aside from the neutrality issue ''(which I don't know enough about to comment)'', I'm afraid that this confirms my opinion that this content would be better in a related article, where proper balance could be given to whether/by whom this is regarded as genocide. I'm sorry, but there is already too much detailed info on this page about specific occurences. This page is necessarily mainly about the concept and history of the term, legal definitions etc, linked articles explore specific events.

== Albigensian Crusade ==

I would think the Albigensian Crusader meets the qualifications of genocide. It was an intentional and systemic course of action to wipe out all followers of Catharism in the medieval period. In fact, the person who coined the term genocide, Raphael Lemkin, stated that it was a prime example of religious genocide. The documented instances of genocide for the "Part of a Series on Genocide" fails to mention this. I don't know where to say this so I just said it on the main page for genocide.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Austrianarchduke|Austrianarchduke]] ([[User talk:Austrianarchduke#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Austrianarchduke|contribs]]) 15:26, 25 March 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:A third option, the best imo, is just to remove the wording completely, retaining only the "for other uses see" part. In an earlier talk discussion, Seraphim System was using the fact that the article was tagged "This article is about the crime" as an argument that the content of this article should be about just "the crime". That was an invalid argument because Wikipedia content cannot be used as source for Wikipedia content, and, furthermore, no discussion had ever taken place deciding that the article should be about just "the crime", and no discussion at all had taken place about the content of the "about" (hatnote) tag.

::'''Comment''' Let me make it clear - ''Jorgic'' is serving a life sentence for a genocide conviction that was upheld by ECHR. The ECHR held universal jurisdiction for the crime genocide, which means any national court can try some for a genocide that was committed outside its territory. It also upheld the broad definition of genocide, in other words, under the ECHR ruling biological-physical destruction is ''not'' required. The work of legal scholars should be cited directly to them, or to a general source like Oxford Handbooks, and not represented as part of the Court's holding about an element of a crime (see [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Legal#Guidelines|WP:MOSLAW]]) [[User:Seraphim System|<span style="font-family:Candara; color:#cc00cc; text-shadow:#b3b3cc 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;">'''Seraphim System'''</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Seraphim System|<span style="color:#009900">talk]])</span></sup> 18:27, 17 April 2017 (UTC)

:::: {{re|Tiptoethrutheminefield}} I will summarize my understanding of the discussion with [[User:Iryna Harpy]] yesterday, which it seems you did not read before responding. On general pages, such as this one, we do not prefer to use primary sources. [[WP:MOSLEGAL]] has certain rules in place for the use of legal primary source material that is consistent with established standards in that field. Since this page does not adhere to those guidelines, we are looking into secondary sources.

'''Comments''' Why would imposing a strictly legal interpretation on a widely used concept be thought an improvement? Why would restoring the 'hatnote' be synonymous with treating the subject as though it were solely-legal, this appears to be a false argument used to try to radically alter ''(and in this case probably distort)'' an article subject. What on earth has Jorgic got to do with the ostensible subject of the RfC, ie the "hatnote". WP is a general purpose ency, it is not a legal textbook whose purpose, conventions etc may be very different. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 19:02, 17 April 2017 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Ditto on the comments made by Tiptoe and Pincrete. This article has been about 'Genocide' broadly construed since its inception. Taking a hatnote and trying to turn it into the [[WP:TITLE]] is contrary to the subject of the article. If it is understood that a [[MOS:LAW]] compliant article should be written explicitly covering the subject of 'genocide' in criminal law, it's a separate question. The subject of this article is, however, 'Genocide', not [[:Genocide (law)]]. Rather than proscribe the article, how about creating a separate article where specialists are required. --[[User:Iryna Harpy|Iryna Harpy]] ([[User talk:Iryna Harpy|talk]]) 23:46, 17 April 2017 (UTC)
::Did I phrase the RfC wrong? This article is full of legal content, which is technical content, that does not adhere to guidelines. There are problems with mixing a significant amount of legal writing into non-technical articles...part of it comes from not following the MOS for this type of article and improperly applied legal citations. If this is not a law article, remove the technical law content (Discussion of cases, applying case law to elements of the crime ... )  [[User:Seraphim System|<span style="font-family:Candara; color:#cc00cc; text-shadow:#b3b3cc 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;">'''Seraphim System'''</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Seraphim System|<span style="color:#009900">talk]])</span></sup> 00:08, 18 April 2017 (UTC)

'''*1. Keep the current hatnote.''' My opinion: Per [[WP:Hatnote]], keep the explanation simple as possible, which I think the current hatnote does. Stating 'the crime"requires prerequisite knowledge to know what is the crime, and also the article is broader than an legal crime.

==Jorgic==
{{u|Iryna Harpy}} Is there a reason that the discussion on Jorgic includes everything but the Court's holding? Totally misrepresents the source, this needs to be rewritten to meet legal writing standards, or removed entirely. Misrepresenting case citations is '''not''' the way to do things. This is why one should not cite cases without legal citation, because the only thing that should be cited directly to a case is a proposition that the case supports directly (this does not include ''dicta''.) Anything else should use proper citation signals like ''See'' and parentheticals. Wikipedia has legal writing guidelines [[MOS:LAW]] - I'm sorry you feel its POV, but I [https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/6-300 did not make up these rules] "'' It is a generally accepted standard that editors should attempt to follow''."

{{quotation| In the Jorgic v Germany judgment of 12 July 2007 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) concluded that the German national courts’ rather broad interpretation of the genocidal intent to destroy, so as to cover the applicant’s acts committed in the course of the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina, was consistent with the essence of that offence and could reasonably have been foreseen by the applicant at the material time (at para. 114). Notably, the ECtHR, in its judgment of July 2007, considered these issues within the context of its deliberations regarding the principle Nullapoenanullumcrimen sine lege as contained in Art. 7 (1) ECHR. Thus, the ECtHR merely held that in 1992, when the applicant had committed his offences—long before in 2001 the Krstić trial chamber expressly rejected the German Federal Constitutional Court’s broad interpretation of the intent to destroy, arguing that the offence of genocide was restricted to acts aimed at the physical or biological destruction of a group—it could have reasonably been foreseen by the perpetrator that his intent to destroy a group as a social unit might be subsumed under the crime of genocide by German courts. However, the ECtHR did not deliver a ruling on how in its opinion the ‘intent to destroy’ should be interpreted in 2007.}}

A couple of recent IP edits, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genocide&diff=next&oldid=791243599 one of which appears to be responding to a 'reddit' discussion], are arguing about the 'a-historical' use of the term 'murder' in this article.

:Hmm. I'm predisposed to the use of 'killing' as being less emotive (and more encyclopaedic) than 'murder'. It's also far more of a standard usage of language in academic texts on the subject, but I guess that that's just my own preference. The changes certainly strike me as [[WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS]] by virtue of a change in the lexicology of the subject using Wikipedia as leverage for changing the language normally used by sources, so I'll register my disdain over heavy-handed revisionist techniques to make a point. There may be no legal reason to reinstate 'killing', but does it reflect RS? I'm not about to parse the [[WP:EUPHEMISM]] guideline, but the [[WP:COMMONSENSE]] application is to avoid modified language in news-style reportage.

== Genocide vs. Massacre ==

What is the difference between a "genocide" and a "massacre"? Are there clear-cut criterias for such terms? Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/139.192.174.17|139.192.174.17]] ([[User talk:139.192.174.17|talk]]) 06:54, 4 November 2017 (UTC)

:Mainly intention, with genocide the intention to 'destroy the race/people' must be present. Also massacre refers to a single event, whereas genocide can be - and often is - an extended campaign. So a number of massacres ''can'' add up to genocide. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 21:15, 8 November 2017 (UTC)

== Genocide correlates with state collapse. ==

[[State collapse]] is a new Wikipedia page, a comparative study of how, when and why states (Nazi Germany, Austria Hungary, imperial Russia, Yugoslavia, USSR, Iraq, Libya, Congo free state, etc) decline and collapse with disturbing regularity, seeking violence and scapegoats as they do so.
If anyone has pertinent comments to add, most grateful. [[User:Crawiki|Crawiki]] ([[User talk:Crawiki|talk]]) [[User:Crawiki|Crawiki]] ([[User talk:Crawiki|talk]]) 12:21, 8 November 2017 (UTC)

Please see [[Talk:Genocide]] for current discussion.

Let's start discussion here.

To call the allied bombing of Germany and Japan "genocide" is a disgusting piece of moral equivalence. It's especially telling that the German Blitz on London or the V2 bombings isn't counted. (Neither should) It's sad to see Wikipedia become ideologically hijacked to the point of uselessness. Pretty soon, I assume, we'll learned discussuion on how NATO operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan (and the Guantanamo Bay prison camp) are especially good examples of genocide and Western imperialism and blah blah...

Do the cases in China and the Soviet Union fit our definition of genocide? Were they directed against a specific group within the country (i.e. Ukranians, Tibetans, Etc.) or just against the population in general that opposed the communist reorganizations?

As I understand the law on the topic, it wasn't legally genocide under international law. Maybe a crime against humanity, but not genocide. Genocide only applies to killings on racial, ethnic, national or religious grounds, not on politicial grounds. -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]

US genocide - The number killed on the Trail of Tears is around 4000, not 100,000.  Speading smallpox among Indians was never US government policy.


----

Correct. The smallpox was spread by Britain, particularly General (Later Lord) Jeffrey Amherst (as in Amherst, Massachusetts) in 1763 during the French and Indian war.

See http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/lord_jeff.html and particularly www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/34_40_305_fn.jpeg and 
www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jpeg for scanned images of letters to and from Amherst on the subject, from the Library of Congress and the British Manuscript Project.

I changed the subject heading to North America from the United States, since the United States did not exist during this war, so it is hardly fair to blame it on them.  Probably a complete catalog of genocidal events, or a catalog of crimes against Indian peoples, would require a more detailed category scheme then what we have here, - Tim

The 100,000 is an estimate of the entire death count, not just trail of tears, but we do need a more authoritative number. --[[User:Dmerrill|Dmerrill]]

One real problem with efforts such as this is that apparently politically motivated people toss out numbers apparently off the tops of their heads.  There have been estimates of the number of Indians killed that have exceeded other people's estimates of the total Indian population of North America.  So to get historically accurate numbers, or at least fair estimates, is a challenge. - Tim

----

Armenian genocide was described as the first genocide of the century.  However, Mexican regimes murdered probably more than 1 million people from 1900-1920.  It is likely that more Indians were murdered by the Mexican government in the 20th century then were murdered by the US government in all its history - but you don't hear about that, because it doesn't really serve anyone's agenda to remember those victims.

Re the comment: "I don't care about 'international law'.  It was genocide." 
 
The fact that we are morally repulsed by a particular mass murder shouldn't get in the way of accuracy in the articles here.  If genocide is defined to be a particular kind of mass murder, rather than just any form of mass murder whatsoever, then we should definitely not include certain political killings in that category.  Create another article if you want, but let's not let our emotional feelings about the issue cloud the accuracy of our articles.  Unless the Cambodian mass murders can be described as directed as a particular ethnic, racial, religious or similar such grounds, then it should not be included in this article.  I am not saying that the Cambodian killings should not be considered genocide, but I do think that we need to understand how the Cambodian killings fall under the definition of that term.

:Merriam-Webster online definition of genocide: "the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group"
-----
Someone wrote:
:No scientific study suggests that killing national, ethnical, racial and religious groups and killing social, cultural or political groups are different phenomenons. Very often it's impossible to tell the difference between two. Therefore popular definition is probably more useful that legal one.
Well, there is a big difference; they are motivated by different sorts of concerns. Killing communists or capitalists is very different from killing Jews or Gypsies or from killing Christians or Muslims. The last ones are motivated by racial, ethnic or religious hatreds; the first are motivated more by political calculations ("if we don't kill all the communist sympathisers they will take over the country", "if we don't kill the capitalists they will destroy the revolution"). Finally, etymologically speaking the legal definition is more correct than the popular one; a racial, ethnic or religious group is much more arguably a genos than communists or capitalists or intellectuals or people who wear glasses are. And I do wonder if I'm being overly generous by talking of a "popular definition" -- a "common misconception" might be more accurate. -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]

Are you saying that people who want to kill communists aren't motivated by pure hatred, or that people who want to kill an ethnic group don't believe "if we don't kill all the ###, they'll take over the country!"

It's pretty clear that people who advocate mass murder of this sort are motivated by the same things.
----
Religious/racial/ethnical/national groups correlate strongly with political/social/cultural groups.
Correlation between religious/racial/ethnical/national genocides and political/social/cultural genocides is also clearly and strongly positive.
I don't know about any event of genocide commited against only one of these two kinds.
Also Rummel clearly showed that genocides agaist both of groups correlate only to power of government and to level of war/revolution,
and not to any real issues.

And etymology isn't any important for science. --[[User:Taw|Taw]]
----

Regarding political vs. racial, religious, ethnic and/or cultural: It seems to me that there is usually significant overlap between political views and what sub-groups a particular individual belongs to.  I don't see any situation in history where killings were done for purely political reasons.  

Political views seem to me to often (<strong>not always</strong>) be an outgrowth of a person's ethnic background, religion, and culture... and because of those, race as well.  I'm not just talking about stereotypes here either, there's a lot of self-selection going on.  Blacks (African-Americans, or whatever) in the USA have often stuck with the Democratic party because they have believed that if they stick together, they will have more political influence in the party, and thereby in general if the Demos win elections. This has worked... sort of.  -- [[User talk:Ansible|ansible]]
----
To take the classic example of genocide, what political belief were the Jews in Nazi Germany exterminated for? None. The Nazis murdered them left, right and centre, without the slightest regard to their political beliefs.

You are correct to note that political groups singled out for killing often overlap with racial or ethnic ones; but that does not prove that there is no practical difference. At best it shows that the same events can sometimes be classed as both political killings and genocide.

Finally, Merriam-Webster supports my definition. (Though to be fair the American Heritage Dictionary 3 doesn't.) But irregardless, the legal sense certaintly is the '''original''' sense of the term. -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]] 
----
You are wrong here.
Jews in Nazi Germany were much more communist than other ethnic/religious groups and communists were one of main Nazi targets.
Also they were culturally different from Germans and improportionally many Jews in 3rd Reich were bankers, factory owners etc.
So overlap between political/cultural/social and religious/racial/ethnical/national was *very* high.
:But was that the reason for the genocide? Did the Nazis murder Jews because they were disproportionately Communists or bankers or factory owners, or because they were Jews? -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]

The same applies to communist genocides.

And "legal" definitions are also of little use for science. --[[User:Taw|Taw]]
:If there is some phenomena being scientifically studied here, which is significantly broader than the original (not just the legal) meaning of the word, why call it by the same name? Why not use a different word? I am pretty sure the legal concept of genocide predates most of the scientific studies you refer to (though to be honest I'm not entirely sure what these scientific studies are.) -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]

Genocides are phenomenon which can be, and actually are, scientifically studied, with good results. --[[User:Taw|Taw]]

well, etymology may not be vital for science, but I am grateful that most 19th and early 20th century scientists knew Greek well enough that we don't have any more 'bicycle' hybrids than exist.  There's no reason NOT to know the meanings of things as well as their functions.

WRT Australian Aborigines and the stolen generation, claiming that it definitely was genocide is a gross simplification.  Many people involved in the removals claim that a)they believed it was being done voluntarily, and b) it was being done to for the welfare of the removed children.  Determining the truth seems to be almost impossible.  However, there were cases of outright massacres of Aboriginal people throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century, which are pretty incontrovertibly (relatively small-scale) genocide.  Anyone like to try and summarise the debate in a form that can fit on the parent page? --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]
-------
Well, it is clear that the Australian government did remove Aborigines from their parents, and that most of these Aborigines claim they were forced to give their children up. Part of the legal defintion of genocide is "Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group", so if the removal policy was carried out with the intention of destroying the ethnic identity of Aboriginal people, it was genocide. The official policy of the Australian government was assimilation, that is, make Aboriginals become indistinguishable from Europeans, which means to destroy Aboriginal identity. Yes, many people involved in the removal believed that removing the children was in the children's best interests, since thereby they would benefit from the obviously "superior" European culture; basically they believed that genocide was in the best interest of its victims. But obviously, believing genocide to be in its victims best interests is still genocide. -- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]] 

<i>Well, it is clear that the Australian government did remove Aborigines from their parents, and that most of these Aborigines claim they were forced to give their children up.</i>
:Yes, but even that claim's hard to establish reliably.  Examine the court cases on the issue. --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]

As an old fellow and a strong supporter of the Wikipedia project, I would condemn any actions that would harm the project. However, as a responsible wikipedian, I find myself commissioned to discuss this topic. It is very easy to write on disputable facts based on falsified documents, faked pictures and exaggerated figures that would only distort history and the definition of genocide. This kind of authorship can give harm to the essence of Wikipedia project. Wikipedians should be very careful about not including the questionable subjects as sheer and undiscussible facts and should also not forget that this is not an area of discussion and debate. This is the very reason that I do not simply change or delete these statements (about Young Turks) and instead try discussing them. 

It should not be forgotten that Armenian genocide is still a historical hypothesis that is dominantly advertised by the Armenian diaspora and is still pending for reliable proofs. There are scholars working on this issue all over the world and some accept the existence of a possible genocide, while some do not. Both sides have reliable and emotional proofs for their own beliefs. The supporters of the Armenian genocide are showing the pictures of the burried remnants of Armenian people killed by Ottoman soldiers, whereas the supporters of the other side is showing the pictures of Turkish people, who were killed by Armenian soldiers. It is not fair to base such a disputable issue by just showing one single reference. I can find lots of debateful articles in Britannica about Turkey or Turkish people and I can also give other references which do not support the existence of a genocide. 

[http://azerbaycan.hypermart.net/tragedy.htm | 1] 

[http://azerbaycan.hypermart.net/testimony.htm | 2] 

I will not copy and paste these references because of the copyright restrictions. 

What I understand from the discussions about this issue is shortly as follows: The ethnic struggles between Turkish and Armenian communities began about two centuries ago. As the Ottoman Empire weakened, Russia and Great Britain provoked one of the main ethnic groups of the Ottoman State, the Armenians to uprise in the eastern parts of the Empire. First sporadic clashes were seen between the Turkish and Armenian settlements. When the Russian army began to invade Eastern Anatolia in World War I, the Armenian gangs with the helps of Russian army, started systematic attacks against Ottoman troops and their civilian Turkish citizens. The same gangs are also accused of cutting the supply lines of the Ottoman army, which was fighting with the invading Russian forces. Under these circumstances, the Ottoman Government decided to relocate the Armenians to the other provinces in the Empire. The reason for that was to prevent the fights between Turkish and Armenian communities and cut the support extended by the
Armenian towns to the Russians. During the period of this enforced delocation, hostilities between two communities and famine heavily affected the Armenian people. The policy of enforced delocation was a routine application for Ottoman Empire and it had been applied to a variety of communities including Turkish people. Young Turks were guilty for not protecting their citizens duely and also by applying this primitive and ancient policy. However, not only Armenians but many other Ottoman citizens suffered from these treatments throughout centuries and Ottoman governments never seem to carry any intention of giving end to an entire ethnicity. By contrast, it is possible to see many Armenian people in the highest ranks of the Ottoman hierarchy (ministers, architects etc). Any researchers working on Young Turks can easily agree that these people never carried ideologies related with the termination of any community. Indeed, the fact that the same events did not affect tens of thousands of Armenian subjects of
the Ottoman Empire, living in Istanbul (then the capital of Ottoman Empire) is the strongest evidence why this incident can not be labeled as ?genocide?. It is also worth mentioning that in the time frame subject to those claims, an Armenian, Noradounghian Efendi, served as the Ottoman Foreign Minister. Moreover, it has been stated in some official records (see references) that when the British forces (who had complete control over all Ottoman official records) occupied Istanbul after World War I, they admitted that they could not find any evidence of an organized genocide against Armenians. 

I do not say that I know what the truth is but I just want to draw attention to the other side of this discussion and to remind that we must be very careful when we are writing such sensitive and debateful articles that could easily be abused for political reasons. I do not find myself authorized to change this article, since I am not an expert of this subject. I believe that we must be very careful about these statements for some mentally sick people could more easily find reasons for their aggressive actions and it should not be forgotten that many innocent people were already killed by such people in this context.

SJK draws attention to the decisions of several parliaments of different countries. I wrote about my concerns in the Talk section why these decisions should not be accepted as real proofs and why we should not base our articles on such decisions. I believe with all my heart that the sinful secrets of history should be uncovered for the welfare and goodness of future generations. But I also believe that this should be done with a sense of equality and justice. This would be much more fair for the souls of Turkish people, who seem to have died or killed in similar conditions as Armenian people. [[User:ErdemTuzun]] 

-----
The governments of a couple of Turkic countries have employed sophisticated PR techniques to spread misinformation about the Armenian Holocaust. Their activities are said to include posting messages to messageboards and the like. There is plenty of information on the internet about the massacres and expulsions carried out by the Turks against the Greeks, Armenians and Assyrians. Misinformation does not change the truth.
-----
There is no doubt that the Armenian genocide did occur.   The only doubt is among Turks who still persist in denying history.   Please do not suspend history for the benefit of Turks, in order for them to deny it.   The German government, the Ottoman Empire's close ally during the First Great War has tons of documents in its archives regarding its ally at the time(the Ottoman Empire) exterminating the Armenians.   

Johannes Lepsius, a German historian, has written "The Condition of the Armenian People in Turkey" in 1917 using German government dispatches and documents as primary sources, which inconclusively prove the Armenian genocide.   This does not matter for ErdemTuzun, as he is not interested in history, but only the fabrications made by the Turkish government.   

Also as many of you know in Asia Minor, has been inhabitated by Greeks also for thousands of years and now the Greeks who numbered over 2 and half million(this is not counting muslims Greeks most of whom are assimiliated as Turks right now) at the turn of the 20th Century, cannot fill a city of 100,000 today in modern Turkey.    The Kurds have also always been in the area and they do not fare well under Turkish yoke either.   The Committe of Union and Progress did not want Anatolia to be a multicultural Empire, they wanted everyone to be assimilated as Turks, and those they could not assimilate were removed forcibly.   The Armenian genocide was also very much motivated by economic means as the Christians(Armenians and Greeks) were in possession of most of the wealth in Ottoman Turkey.     -Nicholas

------

This needs to be reworked.  There is a whole body of literature on why genocide happens that
isn't mentioned here, and the first reason given needs to be attributed rather than stated
as a bold fact.

=== The purpose of genocide ===

Governments commit genocide because they believe it will advance their political interests.  Almost always their interests are held to be inseparable from their hold on power.  Genocides are therefore attempts to strengthen a government's hold on power by eliminating and terrorizing groups that are perceived to be a threat.  They are also an assertion of power that warns other potential political enemies to stay in line.

Often genocides are commited to make its citizenry more uniform. Many politicians have thought that it would be much easier to rule if everyone shared common beliefs, religion, habits, etc.

The individuals who participate in genocides may have personal motives, and it is not unlikely that many participate in the killings because they enjoy killing.  But the opportunity to participate arises only if a genocide is already occuring, which can only be the case if a government believes it will serve its purposes.

---------

I do not understand how people suggest that something they have not personally witnessed have definitely happened or not. Obviously, their ?beliefs? about the existence of an event depend on some sources (books etc.), which may be equally wrong and deceitful as other?s sources. So, I strongly protest the attitudes and wordings of people, who try to suppress a discussion on a topic just because this topic is not compatible with their own beliefs.

As far as I know, scientific facts and hypothesis are discussed by counter-facts and counter-hypothesis rather than conspiracy theories and impolite condemnations. I read my discussion several times and I could not find any sentence, which states that Ottoman Empire did not attack to its ethnic minorities. Ottoman Empire was a gigantic, feudal state and it had the habit of suppressing the local uprisings very harshly just like its predecessors including Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire. Additionally, Ottomans were not Turkish; they were Ottomans, which means that their major goal was to try to protect the benefits of the Ottoman dynasty rather than Turkish people or other ethnicities. That explains why Turkish people were also strongly suppressed, when they started rebellions and such. Especially in 19th and 20th century, these rebellions increased substantially as the general economical status of the state got poorer and as the waves of nationalism stroke. As any governmental authority would normally do,
Ottoman governers tried to restrain these upheavals sometimes successfully and sometimes not.

In the Armenian question, I honestly declared that I did not know the ultimate answer, but I wanted to mention that there were other stories about these events, which were different than those advertised by some Armenians and I thought that people had the right to learn these stories and give their own decisions about this matter. I guess those who state that some event has definitely happened, without giving proper facts and logical statements should check their own honesty about learning the historical truths.

My questions were:

1. Was this a one-sided event or a double-sided one? In other words did Armenian soldiers attack and kill huge number of Turkish people at the same date and location and were Turks also vigorously delocated from their villages as the Russian and Armenian armies invaded ex-Ottoman territories in Caucasia? Well, my sources say yes to these questions. Surely, people can say that this is falsified data and state propaganda, but then I can say the same thing for the Armenian allegations, so this means dead end for the discussion. So, this does not seem to be the best attitude for a discussion and generally it is not polite to lay blame on opponents? data and I believe that this only proves the discussing person?s prejudice and intolerance to disparate ideas. This also means putting a large group of people, who claim that their ancestors were killed by Armenians in that specific time point, in the position of a liar.

2. Is it suitable to call Ottoman government?s actions as genocide or not? I think the key concept of the word genocide and originally where the word comes from is murdering members of an ethnicity intentionally just because these people are belong to this ethnicity. Not because they have done something wrong or they have come against the authority. In this respect, what happened to Armenians during World War I does not seem to deserve the term genocide. But certainly semiology is a flexible branch of science and the meanings of the words can be expanded or narrowed due to people?s own pleasures and I am ready to discuss this issue in a more polite, friendly and scientifically compatible environment.

These were the points that I tried to make in my previous discussion and I was expecting to hear more intellectual words supported by facts and proofs.

As a last word, it is not even close to reality that it is only the Turkish people, who support this theory and there are at least two non-Turkish names that I can remember at the moment. One of them is Bernard Lewis, a British professor of Princeton University and an expert of Near East history. He was strangely condemned by a French court because of declaring that there is no such thing as Armenian genocide. Second and more recent name is Samuel A. Weems, who wrote a book about this issue named ?Armenia the Great Deception?, the summary of which can be found in [http://www.stjohnpress.com/the_great_deception.htm |this website]. 

As to the question of Greek people in Ottoman territory, I have never heard anything stranger than that. Yes, as the Ottomans invaded the Eastern Roman Empire, they mixed with the local Greek people, as well as other ethnicities and that is why Greek and Turkish people look so similar to each other. For instance, British or French people invaded Western Roman Empire and mixed with local Roman people. Now there are no Roman people and the Latin language is dead. Does this mean that people of the Roman Empire were massacred and assimilated by the  European countries? governments? No, they simply melted in the same cultural pot. It is true that Greek people?s population in Anatolia decreased substantially in early 20th century, because Greece and Turkey signed a treaty to exchange their people. So, Greek people immigrated to Greece and vice versa. In the same way the numbers of Turkish people in Greece decreased substantially for the same reason. It is certainly not a sign of good intention not to mention this
important information. On the other hand, present Greece was once an Ottoman territory. So, how come did the Ottomans not assimilate Greek people living in present Greece and only assimilated those living in present Turkey? If they were assimilated then who founded Greece in 19th century. Isn?t that paradoxical? After almost five centuries of Ottoman dominance, many Balkan nations founded their own countries as they were inspired by expanding nationalistic ideas and Turkey is one of these countries. Even this shows that despite some nasty habits, Ottomans were not that bad to their ethnicities and did not genuinely try to eradicate their cultures. Can anyone imagine any Jews living in Europe after five centuries of a possible Nazi domination in the continent? [[User:ErdemTuzun]]

I truly feel sorry for ErdemTuzun, his ignorance is amazing.  Someone else alluded to the propaganda campaigns being used by Turkey.   I will provide links that expose some of this propaganda.   

http://users.ids.net/~gregan/ That site documents how Professor Heather Lowry is paid to be revionist by the Turkish state and make Armenians into assailants and not victims.(Site made by an Armenian and he probably thinks they are "anti-Turkish" and will dismiss it even though it documents press coverage of this travesty.)

http://www.cridder.com/glue/4-22-98/gen-side.html "Nearly eighty-three years after the blood has dried, disputes about the mass murder of Armenians by the Turkish government has invaded a new battleground: universities. Turkey's program to endow a series of chairs in Turkish and Ottoman studies has found takers in several U.S. universities, but others have refused the money, concerned that it is tied to conditions which tilt the historical record for political purposes."

http://www.isg-ags.org/newsletters/25/microsoft.html   "An attempt was made in June 2000 by Microsoft management to revise articles in Encarta, their CD-ROM encyclopedia, written in 1996 by Helen Fein on genocide and by Ronald Grigor Suny [University of Chicago] on Armenia in order to cast doubt on their previous factual acknowledgment of the Armenian genocide. This attempt was foiled by the resistance of these authors and some editors at Encarta"

Bernard Lewis, the historian Erdem cites is a Western historian bought by the Turkish government, do not be fooled.  There is not documentation online of every revionist paid for by the Turkish government, though, but any who reads the links I give can get the picture.  

I will not address all of Erdem's arguments as they are beneath contempt or merit.   No Russian army ever entered Turkey till 1916, the Armenian genocide occured mostly during 1915.    The Armenians were disarmed from the start so it is ridicilous to suggest they could attack 16 million muslims like the propagandists state given these very basic facts.

** In the last months before the end of [[WW II]] and at the [[Potsdam Conference]] 
** the Soviet Union, USA and Great Britain governments took over the German emergency government under [[Karl Doenitz]]. The [[Allied Control Council]] was formed, which acted as military occupation government for the defeated Germany. At Potsdam the [[Big Three]] made decisions and pacts to 'resettle' more than 15,000,000 Germans and ethnic Germans from their homelands east of the [[Oder]] and [[Neisse]] rivers. The legal  Freestate Prussia (''Freistaat Preussen'') government had been overtaken and removed out of office in Berlin by the Hitler dictatorship and gone into exile. Requests after the end of the war to the military occupiers for re-installation were denied. Instead in 1947 the Allied Control Council abolished Prussia. The decision to put the Freestate Prussia and all land  east of the [[Oder-Neisse Line]] out of German control plus the decision to 'resettle' millions of people resulted in the death of millions.

I am following the statements of Nicholas with sorrow and pity. When he confronts an idea against his own beliefs he simply suggests that this is a political misinformation, when he reads the opinions of his opponents he blaims them to be bought by some political fraction, when he meets some statements that he can?t answer he takes a most assertive action against the opponent, which I strongly criticised in my previous message, rather than bringing facts and hypotheses. I think this attitude is far away from being ?contempt or merit?. He is blinded with his own extremism in such a way that, he can not see that the very accusations he is bringing to the discussion may go well with his points too. Namely, Armenian genocide may a political propaganda and the figures mentioned to have been murdered may have been exaggerated. So, there is no point of continuing the discussion on this track.
As I mentioned at the top of my first message, both sides have their own propaganda tools and weapons. Beside being a historical issue, this is also a political matter, since both countries have their own points of interest in acceptance or rejection of this genocide. However, as I mentioned before, Wikipedia is not a political discussion forum and this kind of political discussions may bring harm to the essence of an encyclopedia. It is also possible to find links about several people, who were threatened by death just because they rejected Armenian genocide, however this is compeletely irrelevant to a scientific discussion about a certain genocide. Besides I find it very exasperating to bring very impolite accusations to people rejecting Armenian genocide without strong evidences just because they are representing a different opinion.
As to the Turkish or Muslim massacres in Caucasia, what I mentioned was events that took place from late 19th century to early 20 th century. At this time, most of present Caucasia was Ottoman territory and Christians and Muslims were living together under the protection of the same state. When one looks at a map today, however, this region has been divided into small pieces and each piece of country has a very homogenous distribution of nationalities, religions and ethnicities. Today it is most difficult to find Muslims or mosques in present Armenia (whereas there are many Armenians and ancient or modern Armenian churches in present Turkey). So, how did all these Muslims disappear, if they were not slaughtered or enforced to dislocate from their homes for the purpose of ethnic cleansing. Armenians at that time did have arms. The armed forces of Armenian Dashnak and Hunchak parties were (not so infrequently) targeting civilian residents and many people were killed that way. When a large group of non-armed
civilians face a small group of armed people, their number is completely irrelevant. A good example is about 1 million people once living in Nagorno-Karabakh (now living in primitive refugee tent houses) who were killed or enforced to displace by a small Armenian army and a small group of Nagorno rebels between 1988-1994. On both side of the border, people are accusing the opposite side for the evil acts of the past and since the colossal loses of Turkish people are not publicized or advertised as the deaths of Armenians, people usually are unaware of the details of the situation.
Not only Turkish government but also several Turkish citizens who have lost their ancestors during these events have protested Encarta?s one-sided article editing style and have reported their concerns as I did the same thing in Wikipedia. Encarta has not stayed indifferent to these concerns and added a good statement in articles about Armenian massacres. I guess it would be a good idea to add a similar statement to our own wikipedia article. It is also noteworthy that Encarta in all its article titles has chosen to use the term massacre rather than genocide. [[User:ErdemTuzun]]

The Genocide Studies Program at Yale University says:
*The Cambodian genocide, in which at least 1.7 million people (21% of the entire population) lost their lives, stands as one of the worst human tragedies of the modern era. [http://www.yale.edu/cgp/]

Although the term ''genocide'' carries the connotation of mass murder, in the sense of an enormous massacre, technically many instances of "genocide" appear to be rather "crimes against humanity". Basically, if you're trying to eliminate a "people" it's ''genocide''; if you're trying to wipe out political opponents it's a ''crime against humanity''. 

I'm not sure why the ICC treaty is making this distinction. My personal impression is that genocide is "any mass murder of one million or more people", but none of my recent research supports this definition. 

Perhaps, then, the general term should be ''mass murder''. When an article requires, we could attempt to determine the legal classification of an instance of mass murder, as "genocide" or as a "crime against humanity". In either case, just as many helpless people are killed.

In its Article 7, the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] says:
:For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack: (a) Murder; (b) Extermination; (c) Enslavement; ...

"The definition does not include actions against a political or economic group or social class. It is generally agreed that a definition of genocide which included those groups would have been unacceptable to the Soviet Union and its allies in 1945 as it would have made some of their actions taken in the 1930s and 1940s into a crime against international law."

:I think you missed my point, Uri, so let me first restate yours: You are saying that the Stalinist repressions, the Cambodian stuff and the plight of the Native Australians are well-documented. They really did happen, and serious scholars don't doubt the events one bit. Millions of people were wiped out by their own governments.

:My point is rather that the DEFINITION of genocide AS A LEGAL CONCEPT seems to have been crafted in such a way as to exclude the atrocities just mentioned: Stalin, Cambodia, Australia (or at least Stalin and Cambodia). You and I may think of genocide as government murder of helpless civilians, but that is NOT THE ICC DEFINITION. Sorry to shout, but I thought if I raised my voice you'd hear me :-)

:We need to make a distinction between (a) large groups of helpless civilians being murdered by their own government, and (b) the ICC/UN definition of "the deliberate elimination of a people. Apparently, just killing 1/3 of an ethnic group (as in the Holocaust) doesn't meet this definition. Could it possibly be an accident? An oversight? --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

This article is unfortunately used by different authors for political ends. As Ed points out, genocide has a very clear and simple definition, the extermination of a people. To label the conflict between Arab countries and Israel "attempted genocide" because someone used the phrase "push Israel into the sea" is, quite frankly, ridiculous, and so is the use of the term for the Jenin massacre (if there even was a massacre). To even merit the phrase "cultural genocide" with a mention is bad enough, but this should at most be done in the first part of the article, not in the list of genocides that meet the accepted definition.

The major genocides of the 20th century were the Holocaust (extermination of the European Jews), the Rwanda genocide, and the attempted genocide by the nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union ("Vernichtungskrieg" and re-settlement). I have therefore removed some items, re-worded and re-ordered the list of genocides. I am also missing information about the various genocides that the Japanese are supposed to be responsible for:

"Genocide also targeted at Koreans, Philippines, Dutch (Netherlands), Vietnamese, Indonesians and Burmese."

What were these operations, to which extent were they completed, from when to when lasted they? If this information is not provided, the paragraph should be removed.

Also:
* The expulsion of Germans from the East can hardly be considered genocide -- it was politically motivated ethnic cleansing. There is a lot of propaganda surrounding this issue.
* The experiments of the Japanese with the Chinese did happen, but they were not genocide -- if we mention this, we also need to mention nazi experiments, CIA experiments etc. So I removed this.

:* [[Soviet expulsions of Germans east of the Oder-Neisse line]]. Between 1945-1950 about 9 million Germans from Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line plus 9 million ethnic Germans from various parts of eastern Europe were resettled. About 2.1 million Germans died as a result of the resettlement. They included many distinct different ethnic German groups. The brutal expulsions were done by [[Soviet Union]], [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]'s military and civilian authorities. Expulsion survivors live scattered as refugees.

* ''[[Afghanistan]]'' 
** ''The silent genocide of 2001/2002 in [[Afghanistan]] was committed by the [[United States]] in collaboration with the [[Pakistan]] government, by deliberately cutting off the overland food supplies (by trucks, etc.) to 7.5 million people who were known to be starving and close to death [5]. Before the [[United States]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack against Afghanistan, the New York Times reported that 50% of these 7.5 million were expected to die of hunger if the US requested border closure and/or carried out the threatened [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks. The real number of victims is unknown, but maybe was "only" 1 million or so, thanks to many surviving by eating grass [6]. This genocide was referred to as "silent", because despite 60 years' improvements in communications technology and networking since the [[Holocaust]], US [7] and UK [8] media chose to be silent on this issue, just as German media were silent during the [[Holocaust]] 60 years earler. This [[genocide]] is commonly referred to using
the euphemism "humanitarian crisis" [9], although it does seem to satisfy the ICC definition of genocide above. ''

I agree that as currently written this is not [[NPOV]].  However, I'm familiar with the debate; though it's debated, there are some good arguments for characterizing this as a genocide, and a few references are provided.  I don't think simple excision is the answer in this case.

Perhaps - a very Wikipedia answer - we could spin off a link on "Disputed Cases of Genocide" and place the for/against arguments for things like this in that article.

The killings of civilians in combat, or by their own government in peacetime, is an emotional subject. Sometimes my hands tremble with outrage, and I have to take a break (hours, days, weeks) to calm down enough to write properly.

Kpjas, April, Rmhermen, let's work together on organizing this sort of information. If "genocide" isn't exactly the right word, how about "mass murder", "extermination campaign", "purge" or whatever? The legal category doesn't matter to me as much as what readers will expect to find it under. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]
:Ed, There is a proper place for historical evidence of the expulsions - [Heimatvertriebene]] (however it'd be better named in English). I do not deny it took place but not under genocide.  <br>Sadly there is no article about expulsions of the Polish people from the eastern parts of Poland that was taken away from us by the Soviets.<br>--[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]]

It seems the word ''[[genocide]]'' no longer means "the killing of huge numbers of helpless civilians, either by their own goverment or a foreign invader". I am a bit confused about why (a) I keep thinking that's what it means and (b) the UN has defined it otherwise. 

I guess it's like a "hate crime". If I beat up some other kid in my neighborhood because I don't like him, it's just assault and battery. But if I beat him up because he's gay or black or Jewish, etc., then it's a "bias crime" or "hate crime" and gets all sort of special attention.

What does it matter? A corpse smells just as bad after three days, regardless of whether his murderer wanted to wipe out his whole group (or whether his group is one of the UN categories protected by the UN, such as an ethnic minority). The victim's family is just as sad and angry...

I don't know whether what I just wrote has anything to do with improving the article; I'm just upset and wanted to share that... --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

* As the saying on hate crimes go, it's (in theory) the difference between murder in "cold blood" (first degree) and "hot blood" (second degree).  The "assault" versus "hate crime" seems moderately analogous to "democide/mass murder" versus "genocide".  The idea is, as I understand it, that those who commit assault (or mass murder) do it for a specific purpose and are not as great a danger to the community (or world community) as are those who did the act as part of a (would-be) systematic  campaign against another group.  This is not exactly a moral distinction; both are henious.  It's more of a practical one: what is this person/government likely to do next? Will it cool down unless "provoked" (however unjustified the excuse of provocation may be) or will it keep going because it considers the very ''existence'' of Group X to be a living provocation?

Personally, I find all mass killings to be utterly reprehensible, and I might  cynically suggest that some governments want to reserve the right to kill lots of people as long as it's "only" for political reasons.   But at least I think I comprehend the overall rationale.  [[User:-- April|-- April]]

Without prejudice to the African slavery issue, I think there may be some confusion about what "genocide" means. Many Wikipidians are taking as some variant on "mean and nasty things done to ethnic groups or other large groups of civilians".

Yet somehow the current (and former?) definition of "genocide" doesn't seem to fit, so we keep snipping facts out of articles. I'd hate to think we were CENSORING these facts on pedantic legal grounds. What can we do? --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

* I have to differ here - it was absolutely targeted at a single ethnic group, after all. Europeans were never "slaves" (though bond servitude came close), only those of African origin. The religious aspect was there too - slaves in the US were converted to Christianity will they, nil they. 
* ''However'', technically the ''point'' of slavery was not to wipe out all Africans. It ''may'' have been partly intended to destroy African culture - people of the time spoke of it as "taming" or "civilizing" the "savages".  That, however, would go under [[cultural genocide]].  Slavery was surely a crime against humanity, and many died as a result of its practice, but it was not the systematic pogrom we think of as "genocide". 

* On another note, the genocide of Native Americans should mention South America, too. There were grotesque percentages of the indigenous population lost to the Spanish settlers. [[User:-- April|-- April]]

**** All my life I've heard the word ''genocide'' used as the deliberate slaughter of huge populations.

:Ed, you may have heard the word used that way, but I think we should defer to what the original coiner of the word (Raphael Lemkin) meant by it, and to how the word is defined legally (the legal definition having been adopted at Lemkin's urging) -- under both definitions, if in a bid to reduce the world's population, I randomly chose 50% of the world's population and kill them, I'm not committing genocide (even though I'd be killing 3 billion+ people); but if I killed the two hundred surviving members of some tribe in the jungle because I believed they were an inferior race that must be exterminated, then I would be. According to the original and legally accepted definition, its not the numbers that count (indeed, under the legal definition you don't have to kill anybody at all to commit genocide), its the targetting and motivation that makes an action genocide. If the popular usage is different from this, dare I say popular usage is simply mistaken. -- [[User:SJK|SJK]]
::Okay, the popular usage is mistaken, just as people are wrong to call the 90mm floppy disk (which is 1.24% larger than 3.5 inches) a "3 and a half inch" disk. But let's not say "the generally accepted definition" if it's not generally accepted. Merriam-Webster has "the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group", so I think we have to take into account both international law and popular usage. Moreover, let's be careful that we don't fall into supporting advocacy of any sort. Recent international treaties may be intended by their supporters more to target specific countries rather than to create general rules that all UN members intend to follow themselves; if so, let's not play into their hands. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

Last month, a band of Lendu stormed into a hospital with many Hema patients.  They walked up and down the aisles cutting patients up in their beds.  When they were done, about 1000 people had been killed.  This was reported in the latest Economist, though I couldn't find the story anywhere online.  So today, one group can murder 1000 people in a hospital, and no one will even hear about it.  This was in Congo, by the way.  Just another day in Congo, it seems.  I thought of adding an entry to the genocide article: "Congo, 2002: Everyone killing everyone else, 50,000 dead."

But I had another idea that might be better and suited to Wikipedia.  Once upon a time I started a page called [[Indian Massacres]] where anyone could add documented cases of Indians being massacred by the US government.  I figured we could compile all known cases and end up with a accurate tally.  There are questions about the methodological validity of this project, but I thought it was an interesting thing to try.

Could we do something similar with present day genocides, democides, etc.?  Everytime there was a massacre of some sort we could add it to our page and create a running tally of how many people are being killed by government action or willful inaction.  One purpose of doing this is to make it much harder to kill 1000 people in a hospital without anyone noticing.

== Confusion over the term genocide itself ==

Some people use ''genocide'' as a catch-all term for mass killings, especially when governments murder civilians. International treaties, however, divide atrocities into various legal categories -- such as [[crime against humanity]], [[genocide]] -- which can lead to frustration among those who are already outraged by mass murder and are now stymied by petty ass disputes about what ''legal category'' a given atrocity has to be assigned before they can even talk about it.

I suggest, therefore, that we move slowly and gently in this area, taking into account the feelings of other contributors and keeping in mind that many people are not savvy about international law. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]] 14:01 Oct 18, 2002 (UTC)

I would say if you want to call political killings genocide, first check if they were part of Lemkin's original definition... if they weren't, then the initial paragraph will have to change...

Also, are you sure that popular usage includes political killings? In my experience, popularly genocide means (1) the Holocaust (which was primarily about ethnic/racial/religious killings--the Nazis also of course killed people for political reasons, but these political killings don't play a large role in most people's concepts of what the Holocaust is), and (2) any other killings similar to the Holocaust in some significant way. Undoubtedly the Holocaust is the genocide par exellance, and all other genocides in the popular mind at least, to be called genocide, must be shown as similar to the Holocaust. Now I think ethnic/religious/racial killings are similar to the Holocaust, while political killings are not (or not as similar). Hence I think for most people genocide excludes political killings. -- [[User:Anonymoues|Anonymoues]]

#I don't think posing the "original definition" gives a word creator the right to enforce his definition. Words can and do change. (like "gay")
#Yes, I'm quite sure that a popular usage of ''genocide'' includes [[mass murder]]. Most people I know don't give a rat's ass about what lawyers think. 
#The Wikipedia article should not be swayed by (a) popular usage, (b) political advocacy or (c) international treaties. We must write a [[NPOV|neutral]] article. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

I have yet to see evidence for the claim that popular usage equates genocide with "government sponsored mass murder in peace time" as Ed claims above. If this is indeed popular usage, then it must be extremely recent, since it is not reflected in any dictionary:
* "the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group" Merriam-Webster
* "The deliberate and systematic extermination of an ethnic or national group. " Oxford English Dictionary
* " the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, religious, political, or ethnic group." Encyclopedia Britannica
* "By &#8216;genocide&#8217; we mean the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group. " (Lemkin)

The only disagreement seems to be whether to include political groups or not, with more recent definitions tending to include them. This disagreement should be mentioned in the article (and is). [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 17:20 Nov 25, 2002 (UTC)

[Concerning accusations of genocide by Stalin's [[Soviet Union]]:]<br>
STALIN&#8217;S BRUTAL REGIME WAS CONSOLIDATING POWER, NOT COMMITTING GENOCIDE


PROPAGANDA<br>
People's Republic of China<br>
Mao's regime killed large number of people, depending on which sources are accepted. (Please provide accurate source.) The Chinese government accepts the lower figure. 
Some have argued that the government of the People's Republic of China has committed genocide by killing members of many minority ethnic groups, including Uighurs, Tibetans and others during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Others argue that this is not a case of genocide but mass murder because while minority ethnic groups were killed, so were members of the majority Han Chinese, and at no time has the PRC government undertaken policies specifically to kill minority groups. <br>
THE GREAT LEAP WAS MORONIC, BUT NOT GENOCIDAL. AND I SUPPOSE THAT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A FAMINE PRIOR TO THE COMMUNISTS?<br>

[Concerning the criminal mismanagement -- sometimes presented as "Education"
of the native inhabitants -- of the [[Belgian Congo]]:]

As an aside, it must be noted that the integration of traditional economies in Africa within the framework of the modern, capitalist economy was also particularly exploitative. The most infamous example of this is the Congo Free State. The fortunes of King Leopold II, for instance, the famed philanthropist, abolitionist, and self-anointed sovereign of Congo Free State (1885)&#8212;76 times larger geographically than Belgium itself&#8212;and those of the multinational concessionary companies under his auspices, were mainly made on the proceeds of Congolese rubber, which had historically never been mass-produced in surplus quantities. Between 1880 and 1920 the population of Congo thus halved; over 10 million &#8216;indolent natives&#8217; were the victims of murder, starvation, exhaustion induced by over-work, and disease.

Go online. Some groups think that the US manufactured the AIDS crisis in Southern Africa. That would be a CHARGE of genocide, wouldn't it? Go ahead, put those claims in the article and not refer to the sources as &#8220;very questionable&#8221;.  

In that sense, I'll call those "Free Tibet" claims questionable.

: Actually, I wouldn't refer to these groups as "very questionable" either. I would certainly state that their views are not shared by many people and present counter-arguments; I would also be interested in actually hearing the arguments of the other side. Similarly, I do not state that the view by religious fundamentalists that sexual abstinence education works is "very questionable" although I think it is. The very idea behind the [[NPOV]] concept of Wikipedia is that virtually ''anyone'' can read an article and have their opinion properly represented.  Please read NPOV and associated pages. --[[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]]

That's a good point. So change the wording, but indicate that the sources are very questionable indirectly.

: No, no, NPOV is not about somehow sneaking in your point of view, it's about presenting uncontroversial facts that are universally shared as such, and those that are not as properly attributed opinions. In this case, I have already done so by using the phrases "Most scholars" and "political groups" (I am relying on you on whether this is actually accurate). --[[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]]

Specifically, who holds this view:

: These charges help to indoctrinate impressionable youths in the Free Tibet movement. This movement is arguably a façade for groups with virulent anti-China, anti-modern, anti-Communist agendas, and even anti-capitalist agendas.

1. Introduction of a capitalist economy is NOT genocide, in itself. This is irrelevvant to the article. Stop putting it in: at best it makes you look like a crank. At worst, it casts doubt on this horrible chapter of history.

And if you can't understand this, then add a section about how genocide was inflicted on Eastern Europe, when capitalism led to the reintroduction of feudalism there. F\erdinand Braudel makes an excellent argument about this.

2. Saying that the Tibetan Liberation Front is enough to raise suspicions whether genocide has actually occured there. By adding "extreme factions" you are disingenuously stating that not even the Tibetans believe this, & that anyone who insists that this is the case is wrong. If the majority of the Tibetans DON'T believe this, prove it.

So far all you've failed to convince me of anything I don't know. Except that you are probably the last hard-core Stalinist Communist in exsistence. And that you're arguing from faith, not from facts. -- [[User:Llywrch|llywrch]] 20:04 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)

I would like an arto include something about the mismangement of the Free Congo Republic, but as I said, introduction of capitalism to a group is NOT genocide. And, as you have argued elsewhere, genocide requires proof of INTENT. I have been wondering when someone will bring up that point, & force this entire entry to be dropped, at which time I will be trying to argue to keep it in.

:3 -- The point is not about what mainstream scholarship states, the point is what the Free Tibet group SAYS. If the majority of these groups state that this is NOT the case, then provide documentation.

I'm used to these ridiculous charges from the likes of people like you.

:How do you know who I am? My point is to get you to focus your emotion away from invective and accusations to making contributions that will endure under the NPOV. 
If you can't adjust your style to Wikipedia, then this won't be the last contribution you will see trouble getting accepted.

User Tannin described them well:

"172, let's not get into a misunderstanding here. I would be the last person to call you a communist. Prior to your arrival, a good many of the history pages were rather shallow things, and showed little understanding of the interrelationship between history (in the traditional "kings and queens of England" sense) and the broad flow of economic change that underpins and (in general) controls the actions of statesmen, generals and inventors. You certainly do not fall into that trap! Your contributions have made significant inroads into the task of describing history as an interacting whole. Several others here have objected to what they see as a "communist bias" in your writing. In large part, these objections stem from two things: 

Many people here have spent a lifetime steeped in a rather one-sided view of history - I'm talking about the sort of history that describes the Battle of the Bulge or Second Alamain in loving detail, but relegates Stalingrad to a footnote and doesn't even bother to mention Kursk; the sort of history that thinks Jethro Tull invented the seed drill and therefore we had an Industrial Revolution - and on reading the sort of thing that you write, they (very naturally) tend to say oh, this isn't what I'm used to seeing, therefore it must be wrong. 
You tend to write large slabs of text which is perfectly comprehensible if one concentrates but far from easy reading, particularly as it is liberally laced with the jargon of political economy. Many people see key words or phrases like "bourgeoise", "hegemony", or "accumulation of surplus" and (a) don't really understand them, and (b) assume that because the two or three Marxist or Leninist tracts they happen to have glanced at are filled with these same words, that the present work is more of the same. "

:Frankly, 172, my point of view is closer to yours than you might think. But like many people with leftist views whom I've had to debate, you believe too easily that if I don't agree with you, I must be entirely opposed to you. Learn to build consensuses, & maybe you won't be fighting every battle. -- [[User:Llywrch|llywrch]] 20:49 Jan 2, 2003 (UTC)

Did you read the page?
The content pertains to major "CHARGES" of genocide.


In my opinion Mao, Stalin, and Leopold II did not commit genocide, but the Germans in SW Africa did fall in the parameters of the definition. But this opinion doesn&#8217;t matter. This is not for Wikipedia users to decide. Let's not remove anything and simply let&#8217;s continue to report what others have CHARGED.

The title "major charges of genocide" should make everyone happy. 

[[User:172|172]]

I removed the following: 

:''The German extermination of the Herero in Southwest Africa might have been the first attempt by to systematically annihilate a single ethnic group. Up to one million might have been murdered.''

We have cases of genocide prior to this. The mass murder of the Tasmanian Aborigines and certain groups of Native Americans were systematic attempts to "annihilate a single ethnic group." As for the numbers, the next paragraph gives a breakdown of the numbers--I took them from the ''Encyclopedia of Genocide,'' Dr. Israel Charney (Ed.), ABC-CLIO, 1999. They give 75,000. From there to one million is a bit if a stretch. It is less convincing if we have a breakdown of numbers that show 75,000 in the next paragraph. 172, what is your source for 1 million? [[User:Danny|Danny]]

:Beware vandalism. <b>Someone</b> has reinstated a highly POV thing, claiming as settled fact that there were systematic attempts to annihilate Tasmanian Aborigines by mass murder. The plain fact is, this is an open question and currently a highly contentious one. Keith Windschuttle, for one, is seeking to rebut it. Now, without asserting the truth or otherwise of the original matter, it is <b>wrong</b> (vandalism) to edit out the fact that it is both contentious (POV) and unresolved. You certainly can't safely present it as supporting evidence for something else. PML.

I removed the below, because its patently incorrect. It also fails to mention or consider America's ''greater'' likelihood of commiting atrocities upon Arabs, (given its supreme  military standing )using its attack-dogs, like Britain, Israel, and so forth...  Its quite reasonable, given Americas pulling of strings, the potential killing of (an additional) hundred thousands Iraquis, 
putting all of these things together, could, in the broadest sense, be called a campaing of genocide, over more than half a century. Be we dont add that, and we dont show our western bias, by adding the below. It may be a campaign of terrorism, but not genocide. Its inflammatory, and propagandist.

== Cleaned up this Talk page ==

Hi folks,

We previously had the entire article content (out of date) cut-and-pasted at the top of this Talk page, for no real reason I could determine, and it made this page very hard to use.  I removed it.  I skimmed through looking for embedded actual comments in the article content and it didn't seem to me like anybody had entered any that way, but it's possible I might have missed something.  If I have deleted anybody's comments, it was not intentional.

I also added headings and fixed heading levels so that the table of contents for the Talk page now works and is even somewhat useful.  I did the best I could to think up neutral headings where there weren't any before.  Hope it all helps. [[User:Bsktcase|Bsktcase]] 20:12, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Cat: Military Doctrine?? ==

Since when is ''genocide'' a ''military doctrine''? There doesn't have to be any war for genocides to happen. The military isn't necessarily even involved with the whole business (although ''historically'', it has been in most cases).

== Genocide vs. Ethnocide ==

I removed Jehovah's Witnesses from the piece on the Holocaust. Yes, they were targeted as a group and 5,000 Witnesses died. However, they did not constitute an ethnic group, and unlike any other group persecuted by the Nazis, all they had to do was to sign a form stating that they renounce their beliefs and they would be freed from the concentration camps. The vast majority did not, although a handful did. In other words, they were not targeted as an ethnic group for extermination. Once again, the definition is important. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

:But they surely constituted a religious group, and as such a cultural group? Also, murder is not required for genocide, just the intent to destroy a specific group by whatever means. This would fit the definition then. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 00:48 Apr 8, 2003 (UTC)

::I think a distinction should be made here between genocide and cultural genocide. And yes, genocide is killing. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

:::Anthropologists distinguish between "genocide" (killing people) and "ethnocide" (killing a culture).  But frankly, I am not sure how much weight this article ought to give to this anthropological distinction (which Danny seems to share).  Article II of the UN's Convention on Punishment and Prevention of Genocide (UN GOAR Res. 260A (III) 9) defines genecide as ''not only'' "killing members of a group;" it includes causing "serious ... mental harm," and "forcibly transferring children of the group to another group" (which is not murder but which does cut off the transmission of culture).  So according to international law, genocide is not just killing. [[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]


::::You are basing this purely off the fact that they refused to renounce their beliefs? That is TERRIBLE! I am a Christian, and even if it meant being killed I would hope that I would NEVER renounce my beliefs. Just because they had the oppurtunity to renounce them and be freed does not mean that was the correct choice. Sometimes personal and moral belifs are more important than even life itself.

== Genocide vs. ethnic cleansing (Highland Clearances) ==

I removed 
::'''English Genocide in [[Scotland]]'''

:Genocide in the [[Highland Clearances]]:
:The Highland Clearances occurred when the [[Jacobite rebellion]] failed in the 18th Century, and the traditional Clan system in Scotland subsequently broke up.

:English landlords, in partnership  with ex-clan chiefs, 'encouraged', sometimes forcibly, the population to move off the land, which was then given over to sheep farming. The people were accommodated in poor crofts or small farms in coastal areas where the farming or fishing could not sustain the communities, or directly put on [[emigration]] ships.  Together with a failure of the potato crop in the early 19th Century, this policy resulted in starvation, deaths, and a secondary clearance, when Scots either migrated voluntarily or were forcibly evicted, many to emigrate, to join the British army, or to join the growing urban cities in Lowland Scotland. In many areas there were small and large scale massacres and violence towards the indigenous people.

:In modern times this would be known as Ethnic Cleansing, or genocide.

I do not think this is NPOV and submit if this is genocide then every "restructuring" or revolution  for economic reasons is genocide.  There is no doubt that the Clearances were inhuman and despicable. From my understanding the crofters were cleared off the land to make room for sheep, as they were more profitable.  It was not an English conspiracy against Scots, but an example of greed winning over compassion.  The landlords were not all English and the so-called "clan chiefs" and Scottish landlords were as venal as their English counterparts.  As for it being "ethnic cleansing" - that is also unsupported.

== Distant history ==

I'm not too happy about including things that happened a long time ago under the heading of "genocide". Humanity's moral standards have been changing (improving?) all the time - e.g. at the time of the Greeks, slavery was widely accepted. So I think it's a mistake to apply today's standards in many historical cases.

E.g. take the case of listing some of the heinous things done by the European settlers, in the wars between the settlers and Native Americans, as ''genocide''. Sounds like a good case to some, no doubt - but then go back and look at the '''definition of genocide''' and you see:

: "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:" 
: (a) Killing members of the group; 
: (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; 
: ..
: (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

and you suddenly realize that i) the definition doesn't require '''success''', merely ''intent to destroy .. in part'', and ii) in that case, all of those I listed can equally be applied against Native Americans for their acts against European settlers. (It was 'e' that first caught my eye, as that's something that was reported as happening in a number of cases.)

So if people are trying to joust for the moral high ground, this isn't the way to do it. In this case, I think the self-evident facts (Native Americans are a small minority in most parts of North American, and most of the land is now owned by later immigrants and their descendants) speak for themselves, and the argument about who was and wasn't committing genocide just take people down into a rathole that's a source of anything but enlightenment.

So, I would be really wary of listing any cases that happened before this century. Attempting to wipe out the "other guys" was a common thing in warfare in the past, not the extraordinary event it is today.  [[User:Jnc|Noel]] 17:46, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Err, what? Are you attempting to argue that Native people attempted genocide against the European settlers? I think that's bollocks. Acts of aggression do not constitute genocide. Systematic policies of extermination, ethnic transfer and cultural destruction do. I can't see how you can possibly argue that the term could be applied in both directions. [[User:Graft|Graft]] 18:03, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: Hey, I'm merely quoting from the definition. Are you saying Europeean settlers weren't on occasion targetted simply because of their membership in an "ethnical, racial .. group"? According to the definition in the article (which says, again, ''intent to destroy .. in part''), then that counts.
:: But you seem to be missing my real point, which is not that the European settlers didn't trash the Native Americans (they did), but that it's better to focus on the facts of  what happened, and not argue about which labels apply.
:: If that's problematic here, which I'm using as an example, imagine what's going to happen when people start trying to apply this label in the Middle East.....  [[User:Jnc|Noel]] 18:33, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: PS: Here's a hard, bright line we should (IMO) follow. Don't list anything here as genocide unless '''an appropriate international court''' has found that that is what has happened. Otherwise we're simply going to be forever hassling about whether target group X's case counts as genocide, or just "ethnic cleansing", or whatever the next stage down is. [[User:Jnc|Noel]] 18:47, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: I agree there are recent cases that really would qualify as genocide, but which an appropriate international court hasn't ruled to be such, and it does seem wrong to leave them out.

Etc, etc. Pretty soon you're so far back you're in a different moral climate altogether. E.g., to use a somewhat silly example, does what the Romans did to Carthage count as genocide?

::It's not impossible that the Roman comitted genocide in Carthage. It also clear that the original plan of the Romans was not to exterminate the inhabitans but to get rid of the city.

::[[User:Ericd|Ericd]] 17:59, 12 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Some anecdotal comments on the idea that genocide can only be defined as such if it was brought before an international court: In 1919, Britain pressured the Ottoman government to try former Ottoman officials for war crimes, including the indiscriminate slaughter of about 1 million Armenians--a clear case of genocide. Unfortunately, the acts of genocide were lumped together with the mistreatment of British POWs during WWI. There was a nationalist backlash in Turkey, then in the throes of a revolution, and Ataturk's troops took a group of British prisoners hostage, offering to exchange them for the imprisoned Ottoman leaders. Britain succumbed and there was no prosecution for participating in the Armenian genocide (see ''Stay the Hand of Vengeance: The Politics of War Crimes Tribunals'' by Gary Bass, pp. 106-107). Obviously, this does not eliminate the charge of genocide. It simply proves that in this  instance, ''realpolitik'' took priority.  In other words, apart the standard critique that war crime tribunals are really instances of "victor's justice" (not a critique that I necessarily adhere to, BTW), there are external factors that can and will influence their outcomes. That being the case, the presence (or lack thereof) of such tribunals should not be used to define whether a particular act was genocide or not. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 23:31, 12 Sep 2003 (UTC)

: I didn't say that ''genocide can only be defined as such if it was brought before an international court''. In fact, I explicitly said ''there are recent cases that really would qualify as genocide, but which an appropriate international court hasn't ruled to be such''.
: My suggestion simply was that '''when it comes to listing genocide events''' in the article, then '''to avoid getting into endless debates over whether historical event X counts as genocide or not''', that we use the "an international court said it was" standard.
: Sure, if you decide to skip that, and instead look at each case yourself, then some cases will be pretty clear cut - but others won't be. I can just see the endless debates over whether event Y was genocide, ethnic cleansing, "ordinary" war crimes, or whatever (including "a reasonable policy response".
: In other words, when the Israeli and Palestinian sides show up and start editing and counter-editing the list to claim that what A is doing to B is genocide, I'm going to leave it to you to referee. [[User:Jnc|Noel]] 02:42, 13 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:No ways!  Looking at the scathing attacks whites in South-Africa gets in the historic context for Apartheid and conveniently forgetting why Americans (the European ones, why do people not refer to white americans as European Americans as in African American?) do not have the political "problems" of an indigenous majority population is ridiculous!

In Chechnya, another 100,000 people, one-10th of the population, has been killed and almost half the population is displaced.

== Re: LibertarianAnarchist's edits ==

First off, I don't see the basis for removing the Gujarat riots, other than perhaps the small scale.  I also don't know what was "factually inaccurate" about the information there.  But as for the new material, nothing in the "Poland" entry refers to a genocide at all; it's merely a condemnation of that country, with perhaps some allusion to the Nazi genocide already listed.  Plus, it's horribly POV, and says "considered by Jews" instead of "... by some Jews".  I'd like some justification for this change, otherwise I'm tempted to just revert it. -- [[User:VeryVerily|VV]] 01:29, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)

I removed the following hyper-BS: 
:''Poland is considered by Jews to be the country where the degree of anti-semitism is the highest in the world. Even during Hitler's purge of Jews, the level of hatred of jews among the common people was higher in Poland than anywhere else. See [[Anti-Semitism in Poland]]. Despite the efforts of human rights organizations, it has been difficult to change the thinking of the public.''

First of all, this is an article about genocide, not common perceptions of Jews among Poles today. "Considered by Jews"? What the f... does that mean? I am Jewish, yet I do not consider it such. Did they take some poll among Jews that I missed? Also, "Despite the efforts of human rights organizations" (which?) "it has been difficult to change the thinking of the public" (evidence?). The staement is absolutely meaningless. Even if it had been difficult, as is claimed, does that mean there has been no success? Now, for the person that actually added this drivel, I advise them to do a bit of research and write an article about Jan Karski or ZEGOTA. [[user:Danny|a very annoyed Danny]]

== To Danny ==

Danny,

I am sorry about the incomplete information. I intended to use it as a stub and post the information about the genocide of Jedwabne's jews by the Polish, but you seem to have updated it before I could fish out suitable links.

On Gujarat, it was not a genocide, it was rioting in the same sense as the riots in Los Angeles and Cincinnatti. 

Please follow the contributions of use Boud and you will find that he has been posting stuff which is nothing but Communist propaganda all over the place. I feel frustrated because my aim is to focus on dissemination of information. For some strange reason he seems to hate India and has gone around Wikipedia posting inflammatory stuff. Even when it is pointed out, he won't behave and he comes up with "X alleges... Y alleges..." which is nothing but POV.

I do have data from my Jewish friends from Belarus and Ukraine who told me about the perception of Poles being the #1 anti-semites, but hey, if you feel it is a POV, just point it out to me. I am fair-minded. I'd like to see a high quality encyclopedia.

:It is definitely POV. As for Jedwabne--and I don't mean to diss Eliach--it is also somewhat controversial as to what exactly happened. Kielce would be a better example, but I would classify that more as a pogrom than as genocide. Similarly, would Kishinev (1903) be considered "genocide"? One has to be very careful here and use a specific, universally accepted definition, lest this entire page deteriorate into an account of hyperbolic charges by rival ethnicities, no matter how brutal the end results may have been. As for Gujarat, I know absolutely nothing about it, so I can't really give an opinion one way or the other. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 10:44, 23 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Once again, I am tempted to just revert, but want to hear what others say.  This does not seem to reach the level of a genocide, and the writing is ridiculous: "by the Polish people" (!).

:Indeed, the scale of both Kielce and Jedwabne seems to small when compare to other examples. Both could be included as pogroms (which they were) or political assassinations (as both were apparently inspired due to political reasons), but genocide they were not. Moreover, the common belief that the Poles=anti-semites should not be included in the wikipedia as it's not a fact but a stereotype (I'm a Polish Jew myself). NPOV is the key here.

== Soviet Union ==

This is moved to talk. It was questioned by communst propaganda.
'''[[Soviet Union]]'''
:[[Ukraine|Ukrainians]] - Claims of 5 million civilians starved to death for refusing to cooperate with "collective farming" rules. 
:Some argue that genocide took the form of man-made famines in 1932-33, particularly in [[Ukraine]]. Collectivization led to a drop in  the already low productivity of Russian farming, which did not regain the NEP level until 1940, or allowing for the further disasters of World War II, 1950. These statistics, and the actual existence of these famines is  debated though. Some argue that the famines were generally a hoax. That  collectivization was not responsible for millions of deaths and the actual number of people who died of starvation was much lower and due to other causes. The 1932 [[dust bowl]] crisis which occurred not only in the [[United States|USA]], but also in [[India]] and the USSR, is commonly cited as one explanation.
: It is POV. The only NPOV is information about the dispute and what exactly is disputed.

:: some people argue the jewish holocaust never happened, and those who say that are (rightly so) criticized. Yet when the favorite project of left wing intellectuals (the Soviet Union) commits genocide then denial becomes acceptable, even fashionable. --[[User:82.156.49.1|82.156.49.1]] 23:43, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

Some historians have argued that the millions of civilian killings done by the Soviet government should not be called "genocide" since the motivation for the murders is outside of the legal definition of genocide. No ethnic groups or classes, they argue, were targeted in particular. Sometimes the term [[politicide]] is instead used to describe targeted Soviet killings of particular ideological and political groups.

:: many of the historians who dismiss reports of [[Soviet genocide]] as anti-Soviet propaganda are left wing intellectuals who cannot accept criticism of the left wing communist ideology, they also reject the significant similarities between communism and fascism. --[[User:82.156.49.1|82.156.49.1]] 23:34, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

::: ALL of the people who object to examining the data on its merits ALWAYS accuse those who choose to do so (whatever their motivation, even if it is a search for the truth of the matter) of being 'left-wing-intellectuals sympathizing with the Soviet Union'. This practise(I've never seen an exception) is more than a little POV, at least in the realm of Wikipedic practises, and in a broader sense, it strikes me as interesting that the language used is *always* typically far-right, anti-intillectual, and almost never deigns to present data. (except the one discredited far-right British Intelligence Operative who promulgated the theory that the Great Depression's effects in the Ukraine (similar, if not identical to its effects in the rest of the world's breadbaskets) were part of a plot by the Soviets). I'm certainly not a 'Soviet sympathizer', and it almost pains me to say that *I can't* find a basis for this other than as an early Cold-War false-flag intelligence operation. I can accept that this conspiracy theory will probably never die, but it's odd to me that it continues to be a subject of debate in a place like Wikipedia, where so many people are committed to actually researching, rather than regurgitating right-wing propaganda. If the Soviets did it, then they did it, and yes, we know they were bad. If they *didn't*, and if the evidence suggests that, it becomes little more than an exercise of whimsy and a tarring of legitimate researchers to claim that everyone who wants to examine the issue is somehow a holdout communist, and, incidentally, not even the actual far-left considers the Soviet Union its 'favourite project'. This is an straw man held and used *exclusively* by the right, and the quicker people here who do this recognize that, the better off we will all be, particularly those of us interested in the facts.
"they also reject the significant similarities between communism and fascism"
Do they really? Or did you just invent the connection and then accuse them of rejecting something you made up? I'm amazed that this kind of thing exists here. You seem to believe that more people than you and your wackjobs believe that these two are the same system, when an indepth study of them would reveal, as it does for the bulk of reasonable right and centre-right researchers, that the systems are equally prevertible. I, whether I am Stalin or Hitler, can take any system, well-meaning or despotic, and turn it to my advantage. Using this as a tool to accuse any governing body that doesn't cut its economy completely free of protectionist policy, and any person who doesn't believe that a free-market necessarily, as a concept, naturally results in an ideal society of being 'communist' is. . .   well, needless to say, more than a little reactionary, dualistic, and not to go too far, it's implicitly false.

I am perfectly capable, as, you'll find are the members of this nebulous group that you made up, of understanding the similarities between Stalin's rule and Mao's and Hitler's, and recognizing them as Totalitarian and Depotic. They are. End of that debate. Correlation does not imply causation, however. It is just as realistic, using your logic, to favourably compare Corporate America to Mussolini's Corporatism and Hitler's Naziism. I do not do that however, because they're *not* the same thing. They share certain things in common, but they are distinctly different in practise and in ideology. Marxism and Stalinism are similarly distinct. Both Capitalism and Communism have been used by evil people as the source and support of totalitarian governments, it DOES NOT FOLLOW that they both, in every case, lead there. STUDY them. EXPLORE THEM.

== Fight over the definition ==

Some people use ''genocide'' to include government suppression of political opposition: like Stalin starving to death the Ukrainian kulaks, or Mao killing between 20 million and 60 million Chineses.

Others say that '''politics''' has nothing to do with "genocide" and keep reverting the article to suppress any mention of the connection. Some of these contributors insist that "the dictionary proves we are right". Ironically, the last time this argument was inserted into the article, the dictionary cited '''specifically mentioned "political groups" in the definition'''. So what's up?

Are contributors engaging in censorship, or did they just read the definition hastily?

Let's not fight over words. Some people use ''genocide'' in a political context; others scrupulously avoid using it that way. Wikipedia should report the FACT that both usages exist. It should even report that certain groups or countries oppose the Political Usage of the term; and even try to say WHY they oppose it, if possible. --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 16:23, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)

The only contradiction I'm aware of is the assertion that ''leaving out political killings'' is closer to the Merriam-Webster definition, which specifically ''includes political killings. I wonder if the text of the article should point out this contradiction.

I'm not asserting anything. I'm only reporting that college professors who have published books are saying things. This is the same as the [[global warming]] thing. 

One of us, perhaps, has a fundamental disagreement with NPOV. (It's just barely possible that it's an honest misunderstanding, but that doesn't seem likely does it?) --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 16:02, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Ed, you will note that the last time I edited anything in regard to the definition of genocide or comment on that subject on the talk page was October 22 of 2002. Certainly not an edit war. Your comment from Aug of that year begins: "Okay, the popular usage is mistaken," and you will note that you added the international definition to the article (although I restored it when you briefly started a separate page about the definition of genocide). So you can see how I confused your position. Perhaps as when you worked through [[global warming]], you could add some sources which use it in your fashion. By the way, I have only one problem with the current version (15:57, Feb 12, 2004). I would like something more authoritative than Merriam-Webster. [[User:Rmhermen|Rmhermen]] 17:07, Feb 12, 2004 (UTC)

Thank you for your conciliatory and decidedly non-inflammatory note. I was only kidding when I said ''You want a fight? You got one.'' Sorry for making such a fuss, RM.

Stipulating that the popular usage of ''genocide'' is wrong, i.e., that people shouldn't use it to describe political killings -- then I suggest we move most of the political mass murders from [[genocide]] to [[mass murder]] or just lump them all under the neolgism [[democide]]. You pick.

Or, if we don't need to resolve the quibble over the usage of ''genocide'', let's revise the [[genocide]] article so that each episode is properly classified. The non-political ones should keep the "genocide" label, but the political ones as in Stalinist USSR or Maoist China should have a blurb or disclaimer that says something like:

''Scholars are divided over whether to call this episode "genocide", since the motive was not to exterminate a group based on its ethnic or religious characteristics but to suppress political or economic rebellion.''

I'm not proposing this specific wording -- just saying that if we don't resolve the definition thing at the top of the article, we'll have to deal with it on an episode by episode basis.

Best regards,<BR>
[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] 17:45, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)

[Mainly for Ed Poor:] Yes, you're right that M-W mentions "political group", but you misunderstood my original point, which was that M-W and others do not generally mention anything like what you were proposing as the extended meaning (something along the lines of government-instigated massacres of incredibly large numbers of people). Also, please note that "the massacre of a political group" is not the same thing as a "politically-inspired massacre". For example, it may well have been that the attempted genocide of the Hereros was in some sense "politically-inspired". [[User:Peak|Peak]] 06:21, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I have been trying to follow this discussion, and I have an observation and a suggestion to make.  My observation is that there are two different issues: how to define genocide, and what examples should be provided in the article.  My suggestion is to deal with each of these issues in line with our NPOV policy, and the nature of an encyclopedia.  Specifically, the article should provide definitions the usage of which can be documented.  I'd avoid a dictionary definition personally, because wikipedia is not a dictionary and because dictionaries, like encyclopedia articles, are tertiary sources -- in effect, to use a dictionary definition would be like relying on someone else to do our work.  But I know I am in the minority among Wikipedians with my attitude towards using dictionary definitions.  In any event, I think there are three groups of people who talk about genocide a lot, and on whom we should rely for definitions: international and human rights jurists; journalists; and scholars who have studied genocide (primarily but not exclusively historians).  I think that the contributors have been trying to do just this (so I hope I am not coming off as patronizing) -- but I think contributors have not been applying the same criterion to selecting examples of genocide.  It seems to me (but maybe I am wrong) that contributors have started with a definition of genocidee and have then sought examples that the contributors think are consistent with the definition.  And I think here we get into problems, because Wikipedia is not a place for original research and should not reflect the POVs of its contributors.  My suggestion is to use the same criteria we use for selecting definitions: look to significant groups of people who actually use the term.  In other words, rather than propose examples of genocide, present examples of what ''other people'' -- especially international and human rights jurists, journalists, and historians -- have presented as examples of genocide.  For example, it is not up to us to say that the slaughter of the Herera was or was not genocide.  The question is, have any "authorities" (politicians, activists, journalists, historians) called it genocide or not?  If no one (from these groups) ever called it genocide, we should not use it as an example.  If some have called it genocide we can present it as an example and mention who it is that considers it genocide.  If there is any consensus that it is genocide, or if there has been contentious debate (NOT among wikipedians, but among politicians, etc.), we should explain that too.  By the way, in light of these principles I am opposed to creating neologisms to make room for our own views, I don't think that is very wikipedic. [[User:Slrubenstein|Slrubenstein]]

== Alleged Allies genocide during WW2 ==

Allies during WW2: 3 to 5 million German civilians killed, 10 to 15 million expelled from their homes.
:[[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]]: allied bombers dropped 3.4 kilotons of incendiaries ([[napalm]]) on [[Dresden]], specifically targetting a civilian population (the city was packed with refugees), and creating a firestorm which killed an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 civilians.

:Bombing of [[Hamburg]]: one third of the city destroyed, 60,000 to 100,000 civilian deaths.

:Allied bombers attacked known refugee bunkers in many western and eastern German cities, attempting to "demoralize" the Germans.

:Attacks on German refugees during the [[World War II evacuation and expulsion]]
::Refugee ships in the [[Baltic Sea]] were targetted by allied war ships and submarines and sunk, no survivors were rescued and rescue ships were also sunk.

I am think, that it fits in definition of genocide. Genocide must target members of the same group. Bombing of the city, kills everybody, inlcuding the slave workers. In addition, we should put there also nuke bombing of Hiroshima. [[User:Cautious|Cautious]] 12:22, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I definitely don't think the allied firebombing of Dresden (and to that extent Tokyo) is properly classified as genocide.  Remember the legal definition: "In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with ''intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group''.  It is highly unlikely that the allied planners' intent was to kill all Germans, in whole or in part.  The actions are more properly classified as war crimes.

"Determining what historical events constitute a genocide and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clearcut matter.

An accusation of genocide is certainly not taken lightly and will almost always be controversial. The following list of alleged genocides should be understood in this context and not regarded as the final word on these subjects."

== Genocide vs. Ethnocide vs. ethnic cleansing vs. etc., part 2 ==

There's a bunch of overlap between [[ethnocide]] and the explanation here of ethnocide vs. genocide under Related Concepts.  I know this because I wrote both of them (from someone else's stubs).  I Googled ''ethnocide'' and although the term is widely used and abused, the only serious, scholarly discussions of its meaning and usage did not agree with what had been stubbed.  The stubbed definition didn't seem any different from either genocide or ethnic cleansing, and didn't really make sense as it was entered.  So I changed it to agree with what I found online.  I am pretty confident of the quality of the definition I have provided, so if anyone disagrees and wants to change it, I hope they will do so with a very coherent definition of the new meaning and solid sources cited.  ([[Ethnocide|I cited one.]])

The whole purpose of the Related Concepts section seems to be to discuss different terms that people try to either use interchangeably with, or equate to, genocide, and to describe what each term has in common with genocide and how it differs.  Hard to do that without also giving at least basic definitions, so at the moment there's some redundancy between this section and the articles for each term.  I don't know whether the section should be farmed out to each related term and then reduced here to a list of wikified links, or if this section is fine as-is.

I agree.  The website this list was taken from appears to leave off one of the most important steps of genocide - to disarm the targeted population.

:Opponents of government massacres often insist that the word's usage should include such massacres, even if international law has a narrower scope.

:Others insist that the word should be used only in the accepted sense in international law, which limits the scope to "national, ethnical, racial or religious" groups, even if this excludes some massacres. These advocates claim that their preferred usage is closer to the word's literal meaning and to the primary meanings found in dictionaries. However, the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=genocide] definition reads as follows: "the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group".

The way it is written, it looks like "original research."  It is also terribly vague (who are these opponents and what massacres are they talking about?  Who are these others?)

I did this because the statement is false.  In fact, any state can prosecute genocide (and other international crimes) at any time.  Both the ICTY and ICTR have forwarded cases to domestic courts and the ICC has only secondary jurisdiction; that is, can only assume jurisdiction if a state is unable or unwilling to act.

The replacement: "Due to its gravity, genocide can be prosecuted by any state at any time under its universal jurisdiction. International criminal courts and tribunals function primarily because the states involved are incapable or unwilling to prosecute crimes of this magnitude themselves."

== Section on Sex Crimes as Genocide ==

Jurisprudence emerging from the international criminal tribunals make it clear that rape and other sex crimes (so-called "gendered crimes") can constitute genocide.  If someone does add this, please be sure to discuss genocidal rape not only in the context of reproductive consequences, but also the social and cultural effects on women as a gender (as opposed to baby-machines) in various societies.

== Mao's Genocide ==

I'm not so sure that the famine that occured under Mao can be called a genocide.  It was a result of poor economic planning, not a desire by Mao to rid the world of Chinese people. [[User:Descendall|Descendall]] 01:14, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

*I agree. But even though it is unlikely that Mao actually intended to reduce the size of his own people (and his own ethnic group), we should still keep mention of it in the article. Not only because of the exceptionally large number of people killed - not through warfare or disease, by rather through deliberately induced mass-starvation (as a tool of political control, and not from mere ignorance on Mao's part) - but also as a way to define the limits of the concept of genocide through a short discussion of border-line cases which may or may not fall into this category. For this same reason, I have reinserted mention of the effects of Mongolian and European imperialism. I think the article merits mention of what can and cannot constitute genocide, with a conclusion that that defining distinguishing feature of genocide is that it involves systematic organization and definable '''groups''' of people as well as deliberation and intent. (Wow, this is sounding more and more like law school :v} ) I also think that someone should elaborate on arguments for and against applying the term genocide to deaths through warfare (including war crimes) and mass-sterilization and induced starvations or destruction of sources of food or livelihood. Points to ponder: Is mass rape genocide if reproduction and thus survival of the victimized group of people is not disrupted? What is the technical or legal definition? Who might use the term more figuratively or broadly?

In my recent reorganisation I left in the following:

But the first sentence is a [[weasel word]]ed sentence there needs to be a source and the name of some well known historians and sociologists who include political and social groups.

The second sentence is a defintion and needs to be sourced. If it is not sourced soon then it ought to be removed.

== Stages of genocide chart ==

I have been reading genocidewatch trying to find the political POV that genocide is a market failure, or that it is to be dealt with by intervention. It doesn't say that. They are NPOV enough to offend most everyone, me included, but the chart should not be deleted for the reason given. I will be away, other opinions please. [[User:Meggar|Meggar]] 05:49, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
:I agree that the  chart should not be deleted, I would quibble with most of the points, for example ''People are divided into "us and them".'' implies that US and THEM is a manufactured phenomenon. My experience of living in several countries is that all people do this naturally because if helps reinforce their own group identity. For example Woody Allen's well known (and far from unique) dislike for all things L.A. reinforces his like for N.Y.. I would also argue with allmost all of the "Preventive measures" whichabout genocide as much as genocide watch. if anything, there should be a section about the "Causes of genocide" and white-washing asf., but for now, i don't think genocide watch's analysis/propaganda and subsequent criticism deserves an entire section.

:To wander off topic here - I don’t wish to tout this particular group, but reading their stuff I get the impression that they don’t care much whose fault it is, whether the state or the people, the Left or the Right, or which political system is more evil than another. They seem more interested in measures to prevent potential genocides from growing to the stage where drastic intervention would be needed, and give examples of some that didn’t happen with the help of negotiation and other relief.  That would not be a bad slant to work into the rest of the article.

== Genocide in history ==

I removed the the list of "deliberate large-scale killings of entire groups of people" which [[user:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] reintroduced into the article because any list is going to be either too inclusive or exclusive for some people. The large-scale killings which have been found to be Genocide under international law are in the article and any others are open to "Points of View" accusations. Just see the archived talk pages for examples of this. To make a point or two: why the "past century" does that mean 100 years or the 20th century why just the last 100 years? Why include Rwanda but exclude Germany and Poland and there was deliberate mass killing in the trenches of the First Word War which is not listed. I could go, on but as the genocides recognised under international law are already listed and discussed in the article, I do not think that an arbitary list of mass killings should appear in this section, just the link to the article [[Genocide in history]]. --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 09:17, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

:This problem is easy to solve. I suggest changing "deliberate large-scale killings of entire groups of people" into "deliberate large-scale killings of entire groups of civilians during peace time". Would this resolve the issue with WWI? Please note, the section is talking about mass killings of civilians in human history. Mentioning specific examples of such killings is appropriate, don't you think?--[[User:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] 04:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

The section is talking about "Genocide in history" not about "Mass killings" in history and readers will assume that any list is a list that the author(s) designates as genocides. If it is not a list of Genocides then it should not be in this article and if it is in this article then it is going to be a POV list, therefore I do not think that such a list should be present when there is another article devoted to the subject. --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 08:56, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

:Where did "a list of Genocides" come from? Isn't that already a very strong point of view? A list of mass homicides is actually less biased since it's based on nothing but well known facts. The article then goes to say "Determining which historical events constitute genocide and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clear-cut matter." Yet, you '''are''' making it "clear-cut" in this article, thus enforcing a POV.--[[User:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] 01:55, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

Yes I am making it clear cut because the article is named "Genocide" not "Mass killings" and the section is "Genocide in history" not "Mass killing in history" --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 21:51, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

:You haven't answered the question. Is the goal of this article to provide NPOV or just your personal view on what genocide and what's not? Why can't the reader decide for himself? All we need to do is to provide relevant historical facts.--[[User:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] 05:15, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

Which question have I not answered? There is a whole article dedicated to "provid[ing] relevant historical facts" called [[Genocides in history]] which this article says is the "''Main article:''" on the first line of the section "Genocides in history" with a link to the article. So if a person wishes to find out more it is only one click away.  How would an arbitrary list of "Mass killings" improve this article particularly as not all mass killings are genocides? --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 13:48, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

:You haven't answered the question "Where did "a list of Genocides" come from?". If I open [[Genocides in history]], there are more genocides listed there than in this article. Again, despite your personal assertion, genocide is not a clear-cut term. So which definition of genocide and whose judgement of specific mass killings do you wish to apply in this article?--[[User:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] 19:35, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

Genocide is a clear cut term under international law. There is a list of genocides in this article which international courts have judged to be genocides. Any other alleged genocides are just that, alleged.  You will have noticed that "Genocides in history" carries a two templates {{tl|totallydisputed}} {{tl|ceanup-date}}(August 2005) IMHO it is better to keep the non-NPOV in that article rather than importing it into this one and having the same debate here. I think this debate is becoming stale and it needs others to join in because I do not think that either of us is going to persuade the other to come around to their POV. So if you are lurking please add your POV to this debate. --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 20:10, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

:So your answer is, only those mass killings that are acknowleged to be genocides by "international courts" are "true" genocides. This way the Holocaust is not a genocide since the definition of genocide was brought forward only after the Nuremburg Trials. I am not aware of any international court convicting any Nazi criminals after that. Meanwhile the word "genocide" was coined to reflect the crime of the Holocaust. Also, I am not opposing or supporting your views, just trying to learn them better.--[[User:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] 21:22, 30 December 2005 (UTC)


Yes and no. I think that this article should restrict its self to those mass killings that are acknowledged to be genocides by international courts, not because they are the only "true" genocides, but because they are the only genocides which can be called such and have international legal backing and acceptance. As you point out the word "genocide" was coined to reflect the crimes of the Holocaust and as such I think it would be perverse not to include that episode in this article, particularly as the major criminals were found guilty of "[[crimes against humanity]]" and the wording of the [[London Charter]], which although not using the yet to be coined word genocide, did define a "crime against humanity" along similar lines ("namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war; or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds") to the CPPCG definition. A further, argument to including the Holocaust in this article is that there are hundreds of references which state that the Holocaust was a genocide and those who argue against this position are for the most part discredited [[Holocaust deniers]] so it too has legal backing and widespread acceptance as a genocide. For alleged genocides, there tend to be people on both sides of the argument and I think that those are better dealt with in the article "genocides in history" --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 17:50, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

:I think you just weasel your way out of the question. If it's "yes and no" then don't interfere with the edits. It isn't your prerogative to decide on these matters. And many of those "mass killings" were internationally accepted as genocides. So again your POV is a pure speculation, a way to discriminate one mass killing from another based on personal preferences. Since when Stalin mass murders aren't internationally accepted as crimes against humanity? Every democratic country in the world thinks so. Yet we weasel and don't accept it?--[[User:Andrew Alexander|Andrew Alexander]] 21:24, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

I can not answer the question with a simple yes or know because you constructed you argument about what you thought I though in a similar way to the classic question "Do you sill beat your wife?". I am sorry that you think I "just weasel your way out of the question", it was not my intention to do so and I think the rest of my answer makes my position clear. It is lucky for me that there is no prohibition on weasel words on talk pages :-) There are however policies which effect what is written on article pages including [[Wikipedia:No original research|no original research]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability]], and guidelines on [[wikipedia:citing sources|citing sources]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]]. I do not have to decide if Stalin's mass murders are "internationally accepted as crimes against humanity" because this article is about genocide not crimes against humanity and if you know that they are internationally accepted as genocide, then you will be able to provide reliable sources which state that such actions are internationally accepted as genocide. --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 23:31, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

I am not sure why we are arguing this here. Would it not be more constructive to work togehter on the [[Genocides in history]] article to get reliable sources for the entries there, before trying to decide if any particular historical genocide should appear on this page? For example the one entry uner the USSR is for the Holodomor with the sentence "The proponents of the 'Holodomor' term maintain that the famine was an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people engineered by the Soviet government." Now there is a weasel term with no reliable source on the page to back it up. I am sure that you could help improve the article by providing sources as to who claims it is a genocide --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 23:47, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

== Worst Genocides ==

Sept. 27: I just noticed this: "The worst genocide in history is deemed to have been committed during the Islamic invasion of India from the 11th century onwards. More than 80 Million Hindus and Buddhists were killed during those 700 years of invasion. Also millions were forcibly converted to Islam, thousands were enslaved and taken back to Central Asia and Arabia. "

The source for this highly dubious claim? Another Wikipedia article! There is not a single reputable historian of genocide who would agree with that statement. And this happens to be a classic case of using the passive voice to confuse people: "is deemed to have been"... by whom??!! This is truly outlandish, and, placed so prominently in the article, only serves to fan the flames of anti-Muslim prejudice.

----



I just removed the claim that the slaughter of the indigenous people of North America was the worst genocide in history. It may have been a very large genocide, certainly millions of people died and many populations were wiped out, many deliberately, but there is a big question over whether it was the largest.

To address this issue I think that we should have a chart with the largest genocides - low and high credible/established estimates, and a list of major genocides in the twentieth century (and present...) 

What do others think? [[user:Mostlyharmless|Mostlyharmless]]

Genocide is a word, and that word has a meaning. Events that correspond to that meaning should be considered genocides..Why is it then that we have this strange tradition of only acknowleging genocides when the UN acknowleges it first? No mention is made here of the Armenian genocide, the 1971 genocide in East Pakistan (1.5 million people killed, 500,000 women raped), and little is mentioned on the genocide in Darfur and that in Bosnia...If the reason is that nobody bothered to expand the entry to include these historical events, I'll start on that as soon as I can.

:With the exception of the Bosnia geonocide, all the others you mention are open to claims and counter claims (as no-one was found guilty of the crime of genocide), as such it is better that they go in genocides in history. --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 21:33, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

Differentiating between genocide-as-legal-charge and genocide-as-analytical-description can be tricky. Most documented mass killings have some kind of scholarly consensus regarding death tolls and incidences of related atrocities, with defensible low estimates and high estimates for the numbers of people affected. An encyclopedic entry that gets into numbers should list the generally accepted low-high ranges, as some parts of the "Genocides in History" article do. When the facts are not established (how much was killing and how much was unintended pandemic disease, e.g.), this should be noted. When the facts are sparse they should include references, to make sure that death tolls or the "genocide" label are not just political invective from some partisan groups. Adding descriptors like "worst" or "largest" veers close to POV territory, particularly for events with large noncombatant death tolls (the Americas from the Spanish conquest on, or Soviet collectivization 1929-1933, e.g.) that don't necessarily neatly fit under the "genocide" concept. -

:people overlook the indian genocide in America, but it was really ruthless, and probably, if not, id say it was pretty much the worst for the times that we live. Not only they were eliminated systematicly (with the decimation of the buffalo, for example, as the buffalo was the equivalent of seals to skimos) but they were stolen from their lands, religion, culture and language. Laws did not aplied equallly to indians either, a crime that a white man could get away with imprisonment, sometimes meant death for an indian. Across the american continent, there are hundreds of native languages that have been lost, as most indians died of disease or deliberately by the colonists. In Argentina, landowners used to pay for indian penises/ears (trophies that certified the killing of an indian), today theres almost no indian population in Argentina, same thing can be sayd of the US, today there is a reduced native population, without any land that they could call their own, now most of their lands belong to those who were once immigrants.

In response to suggestion of chart, there is response "We have that under Genocides in history."  There's no chart there.  A chart is ALWAYS more helpful to absorb and comprehend copious amounts of info.  Since there are so many different and distinct genocides, a chart would, IMHO, be very, very useful.

Depending on your perspective, there's always going to be disagreement as to which was the worst genocide. [[User:Jtpaladin|Jtpaladin]] 17:00, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

== Definition of Genocide's exclusion of Politicide ==

Preface:

I’m a new user to the comment/edit side of Wikipedia and am NOT an expert on Genocide.  Because of these two factors, I am uncomfortable doing an edit change to this article so I opted to start a discussion in the hope that someone more qualified than I might make the suggested edits; if they have merit.  

Background:

When doing some research on Genocide I found myself uncomfortable with the limited definition given in Wikipedia.  That said, I understand and support the use of a standard internationally recognized definition for Genocide, and unfortunately, the CPPCG is all we appear to have.

As stated in the Wikipedia article, "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" governments that approved the international definition were/are actively engaged in the "... killing of members of a social class, members of a political or ideological group, and that of cultural killings."  To avoid accountability for their crimes, these governments deliberately excluded these atrocities from the official international definition of genocide.

To me, this is the equivalent of having criminals write the legal definition of what constitutes a crime – but the CPPCG definition is better than nothing.  Hopefully it will someday be expanded to include all government-sponsored atrocities against humanity.

Suggested Addition(s):

In the “Criticisms of the CPPCG” section, I would like to see the term "Politicide" added, with a link to the Wikipedia Politicide page.  Possibly other relevant “-cide’s” I am not aware of should be added too.  This would help people doing research on government sponsored atrocities to easily understand why the deliberate murder of tens of millions of Russians, Chinese, and others are not “Genocide” and are allowed under international law.

::*8  It is well established that where a conviction for genocide relies on the intent to destroy a protected group “in part,” the part must be a substantial part of that group. The aim of the Genocide Convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups, and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole. Although the Appeals Chamber has not yet addressed this issue, two Trial Chambers of this Tribunal have examined it. In Jelisic, the first case to confront the question, the Trial Chamber noted that, “[g]iven the goal of the [Genocide] Convention to deal with mass crimes, it is widely acknowledged that the intention to destroy must target at least a substantial part of the group.”[10] The same conclusion was reached by the Sikirica Trial Chamber: “This part of the definition calls for evidence of an intention to destroy a substantial number relative to the total population of the group.”[11] As these Trial Chambers explained, the substantiality requirement both captures genocide’s defining character as a crime of massive proportions and reflects the Convention’s concern with the impact the destruction of the targeted part will have on the overall survival of the group.[12]

In Kayishema, the Trial Chamber concluded, after having canvassed the authorities interpreting the Genocide Convention, that the term “‘in part’ requires the intention to destroy a considerable number of individuals who are part of the group.”[14] This definition was accepted and refined by the Trial Chambers in Bagilishema and Semanza, which stated that the intent to destroy must be, at least, an intent to destroy a substantial part of the group.[15]
::*10  This interpretation is supported by scholarly opinion. The early commentators on the Genocide Convention emphasized that the term "in part" contains a substantiality requirement. Raphael Lemkin, a prominent international criminal lawyer who coined the term "genocide" and was instrumental in the drafting of the Genocide Convention, addressed the issue during the 1950 debate in the United States Senate on the ratification of the Convention. Lemkin explained that "the destruction in part must be of a substantial nature so as to affect the entirety."[16] He further suggested that the Senate clarify, in a statement of understanding to accompany the ratification, that "the Convention applies only to actions undertaken on a mass scale."[17] Another noted early commentator, Nehemiah Robinson, echoed this view, explaining that a perpetrator of genocide must possess the intent to destroy a substantial number of individuals constituting the targeted group.[18] In discussing this requirement, Robinson stressed, as did Lemkin, that "the act must be directed toward the destruction of a group," this formulation being the aim of the Convention.
::*11  Recent commentators have adhered to this view. The International Law Commission, charged by the UN General Assembly with the drafting of a comprehensive code of crimes prohibited by international law, stated that "the crime of genocide by its very nature requires the intention to destroy at least a substantial part of a particular group."[20] The same interpretation was adopted earlier by the 1985 report of Benjamin Whitaker, the Special Rapporteur to the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities.[21]
::*12  The intent requirement of genocide under Article 4 of the Statute is therefore satisfied where evidence shows that the alleged perpetrator intended to destroy at least a substantial part of the protected group. The determination of when the targeted part is substantial enough to meet this requirement may involve a number of considerations. The numeric size of the targeted part of the group is the necessary and important starting point, though not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry. The number of individuals targeted should be evaluated not only in absolute terms, but also in relation to the overall size of the entire group.  In addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion, its prominence within the group can be a useful consideration. If a specific part of the group is emblematic of the overall group, or is essential to its survival, that may support a finding that the part qualifies as substantial within the meaning of Article 4.
:The last sentence is significant and in my opinion potentially controversial, because it is a way of including things like social-economic groups which the USSR had excluded from the original drafting of the convention. It was used in this case to say that men were more important to the group identity than women and children. Also the argument used to find this massacre a genocide is probably storing up trouble for future cases:
::*13  The historical examples of genocide also suggest that the area of the perpetrators’ activity and control, as well as the possible extent of their reach, should be considered. Nazi Germany may have intended only to eliminate Jews within Europe alone; that ambition probably did not extend, even at the height of its power, to an undertaking of that enterprise on a global scale. Similarly, the perpetrators of genocide in Rwanda did not seriously contemplate the elimination of the Tutsi population beyond the country’s borders.[23] The intent to destroy formed by a perpetrator of genocide will always be limited by the opportunity presented to him. While this factor alone will not indicate whether the targeted group is substantial, it can - in combination with other factors - inform the analysis.
:Because first it is not accurate, the Germans treated Jews in Tunisia (Africa) as they treated Jews in every area they occupied (see [[Jews outside Europe under Nazi occupation]]). Second because it was used, with the last sentence of paragraph 12, to find the killing of around 8,000 men as Genocide, even though as the judgement says in paragraph 15 "The size of the Bosnian Muslim population in Srebrenica prior to its capture by the VRS forces in 1995 amounted to approximately forty thousand people. This represented not only the Muslim inhabitants of the Srebrenica municipality but also many Muslim refugees from the surrounding region. Although this population constituted only a small percentage of the overall Muslim population of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time". This ruling has the potential of moving the defintion of Genocide from the group that has been killed to the perpotrator. What I mean by this is that Radislav Krstic was found guilty of genocide because he kill all those men he had access to in Srebrenica which was most of the total Muslim male population he had access too. Theoretically even if [[Slobodan Milosevic]] had been found guilty of complicity in the massacre he might not have been found guilty of genocide if he could prove that he had access to more of the victim population, turning his access at Srebrenica from a substancial part of the victim population to an unsubstancial part. It turns the crime of Genocide from one of absolute, ie anyone who took part is guilty of complicity in a genocide, to one of degree based on the size of the population the purpatraor has access too. --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 14:09, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

== Responsibility To Protect ==

[[The Independent]] on Saturday 16 Spetember 2006 ran an article by Paul Vallely ''[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article1603857.ece Day for Darfur inspires protests in 32 countries]'' saying that:
: ...
:''The protest  is over the refusal of the Sudanese government to allow a 20,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force into Darfur to protect the civilian population as a war escalates between the Sudanese army - with its ruthless Janjaweed militia - and various rebel groups. Campaigners fear that Sudan will use the new offensive to impose a brutal and definitive solution.

:''Tomorrow has been chosen because it is the first anniversary of a revision of international law by world leaders at the United Nations which insisted that the need to protect people from atrocities must override the notion of national sovereignty.

:'''''Under the Responsibility To Protect (RTP), the UN agreed that states would share "responsibility to take collective action in a timely and decisive manner" to prevent grave atrocities like genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity "when the government of the people concerned is unwilling or unable to do so".'''' ...

If there is general consensus that RTP is interpreted as the Indi interprets it, it should be documented in this article.  Because it drives a coach and horses through Article 2.7 of the UN Charter:
:''Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll.

Lord Jeffrey Amherst, commander of British forces in North America during the French and Indian War was the responsible party (1756-'63).

The only reason it is considered 'alleged' is because modern-day Turkey (and its exclaves) deny it. The majority of the western academic world accepts and defines it as genocide. It certainly should be listed, particularly seeing as how it was used as an example in coining the word (see [[Raphael Lemkin]]).[[User:The Myotis|The Myotis]] 16:45, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:There was no international tribunal to try the perpetrators. Those who were tried were tried under domestic laws and as there was no such offence as genocide at that time so if they were found guilty they were found guilty of other crimes. There should not be any listing of the genocide  here because it is covered in the [[Genocide in history]] and it is only an alleged genocide given that there was no guilty verdict handed down by an international tribunal. The perpetrators of the Holocaust were not found guilty of Genocide but of crimes against humanity, but they were found guilty by an international tribunal of those crimes. I think it better that only incidents where people are found guilty of Genocide are listed in this article. Those incidents before the Convention, or incidents where there was not a trial, are listed in the article [[Genocide in history]] as it stops this article being the focus of POV wars.  --[[User:PBS|PBS]] 18:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::Talat, Enver and Cemal all fled turkey before they could be tried under any court (though a Turkish military tribunal did try them in abstentia and find them guilty of war crimes) and all were killed ( Enver in Russia, Talat in Germany, and Cemal in Georgia) within 7 years. Just because the guilty parties fled justice (and because the Turkish tribunal is not international) does not mean these events did not occur. If the League of Nations, which had only been established only a year before Tallat’s death, had managed to apprehend these war criminals, then it surely would have found them guilty. The fact that a national court – the very nation they had controlled - found them guilty should be worth something.[[User:The Myotis|The Myotis]] 23:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::: Although the information given in the article is the academic and judicial meaning of genocide, some critics are ultimately political. Cemal Pasha found guilty by the Ottoman Empire not because of he interfered any mass killing but beause he provoked the ethnic Arabs for a rebellion movement. The other misleading point is their murders. Cemal Pasha was murdered by Armenian paralimilitary groups in Tbilisi on 22nd July 1922, Talat Pasha was killed by an Armenian named Sogomon Tehliryan in Germany in 1921 and Enver Pasha was killed in Tajikistan on the 4th of August 1922 in battlefield.

Mr. PBS forgets that likewise the Jewish Holocaust occured before the 1948 UN Convention.  So, according to his rules neither the Holocaust should be listed.  International Genocide laws and conventions apply fully on the current Turkish state that continues to obfuscate and deny it's genocide of the Armenians. - Berge Jololian <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:199.46.198.233 |199.46.198.233 ]] ([[User talk:199.46.198.233 |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/199.46.198.233 |contribs]]) 18:51, 17 May 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})</small>

Mr. PBS, self proclaimed "expert" stated that the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 does not qualify to be listed because as he puts it, occurred before the UN Convention and is "alleged" genocide. Mr. Shearer is either a denialist or an idiot (perhaps both). The last act of the perpetrator of a genocide is Denial. The only country in the world that denies its genocide of the Armenians is Turkey and PBS. In a report by Dr. Tessa Hoffman on Turkey's treatment of its minorities, she reports that in 1983 the Turkish army forced an Armenian village named Harent in present day eastern Turkey and forced the 600 inhabitants of the village to renounce their identity, convert their religion to Islam, and change their Christian Armenian names to Islamic Turkic names. The Church village was changed to a Mosque and the names of the forced converts proudly published in local newspapers. If that is not on going genocide, what is? The Turkish government went even further in 2002 by changing all the scientific names of native plants and animals in the Armenian plateau (eastern turkey) to erase any references to Armenian. Not to mention the thousands of historical Armenian monuments spanning over two millenniums deliberately destroyed and eradicated. Genocide stops when denial ceases. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Jololian|Jololian]] ([[User talk:Jololian|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jololian|contribs]]) 21:37, 6 June 2007 (UTC{{{3|}}})</small>

Raphael Lemkin who was a lawyer of Polish-Jewish descent and a Holocaust survivor was so affected by the barbarity that befell the Armenians at the hands of the Turks between 1915-23, that he created the word GENOCIDE to describe what had happened to the Armenians. Lemkin's frame of mind during the 1930's was on the Armenian experience. The 1948 UN convention on prevention of genocides cites the Armenian genocide as an example. (1949 CBS News interview with Lemkin -Video)  

The word genocide was coined by Lemkin to describe the Armenian experience.  The word "genocide" existed because of the Armenian experience.  

The word “holocaust” has been widely used since the 17th century to refer to the violent death of a large number of people. Before World War II the word was used by Winston Churchill and others to describe the Armenian Genocide of World War I.  

Before Lemkin coined the word genocide to describe the Armenian mass slaughter it was known as the Armenian holocaust.

The International Association of Genocide Scholars unanimously approved a 2005 letter stating that “the overwhelming opinion of scholars who study genocide” is that the murders were genocidal.

To deny the Armenian genocide “is like Holocaust denial,” said Gregory Stanton, vice president of the association, president of Genocide Watch and a professor of human rights at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia.

Many leading scholars say the massacres clearly fit the definition of genocide. - Berge Jololian  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/65.96.161.240|65.96.161.240]] ([[User talk:65.96.161.240|talk]]) 04:16, 16 November 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Since the official definition of genocide allows for the cultural/religious destruction of a people's way of life, the first sentence is somewhat misleading.

I think it is important to emphasize that destruction of culture (such as forcibly deporting/kill all rural members of a ethnic group such as happened with the Kurds) is an intentional part of the definition of genocide.

I added a bit to the lede--a paren indicating that extermination is not necessary in the lede graf. I also added a 2nd graf: "It is important to note that under the various accepted definitions (see below), the act or crime of genocide does not reqire that the subject people actually become extinct or eliminated. In fact, most targets of genocide have managed to continue to exist as a people." I think this is good to have this up top. I was just stunned in an online conversation with someone who should know better who thought that genocide means only that absolute extermination of a people. By that definition almost nothing we think of today as genocide would qualify. So I though it important to make this point clearer near the top--even tho is is already in the entry lower down.

== Coining of the term genocide ==

It isn't clear to me, what needs to be referenced in this para: the narrowness of the definition or that it was mainly based on the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide or that it was narrow because it was based on the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide. What is more the statement about the narrowness of the definition is perhaps misleading.  His definition reads: "By 'genocide' we mean the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group." (In 1946 he is even clearer: "Genocide is the crime of destroying national, racial or religious groups.) In the rest of the text he tends to use the word "national group" but the context seems clear that he means both national and ethnic groups.  Already in 1933 he defines the "offense of barbarity" as committed against racial, religious, or social collectivities.  I suggest editing the para to read as follows:
:The term "genocide" was coined by [[Raphael Lemkin]] (1900-1959), a [[Poles|Polish]]-Jewish legal scholar, in 1943, from the roots γένος ''genos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for family, tribe or race) and ''-cide'' ([[Latin]] - ''occidere'' - to massacre) in the context of the Jewish Holocaust. Lemkin's genocide definition was based mainly on the [[Holocaust]] and [[Armenian genocide]].<ref>Samantha Power, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide. pp. 21, 43 in the 2002 London, Flamingo edition</ref>  It addressed crimes against "national, racial or religious groups".  His definition included not only physical genocide but also acts aimed at destroying the culture and livelihood of the group.<ref>Raphael Lemkin, [http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/americanscholar1946.htm Genocide] American Scholar, Volume 15, no. 2 (April 1946),            p. 227-230</ref>

Finally, I propose deleting the last para of this section as repetitive.

== Genocide ==

By Ahmet Altan May 9, 2005 http://www.gazetem.net/ahmetaltan.asp Translated by the Zoryan Institute

I would like to ask a very simple, ordinary question.

Would you wish to be an Armenian in 1915?

No, you wouldn't.

Because now you know you would have been killed.

Please stop arguing about the number of murdered or the denials or the attempts to replace pain with statistics.

No one is denying that Armenians were murdered, right?

It may be 300,000, or 500,000, or 1.5 million.

I don't know which number is the truth, or whether anyone knows the true number accurately.

What I do know is the existence of the death and pain beyond these numbers.

I am also aware how we forget that we are talking about human beings when we are passionately debating the numbers.

Those numbers cannot describe the murdered babies, women, the elderly, the teenage boys and girls.

If we leave the numbers aside, and if we allow ourselves to hear the story of only one of these murders, I am sure that even those of us who get enraged when they hear the words "Armenian Genocide" will feel the pain, will have tears in their eyes.

Because they will realize that we are talking about human beings.

When we hear about a baby pulled from a mother's hands to be dashed on the rocks, or a youth shot to death beside a hill, or an old woman throttled by her slender neck, even the hard-hearted among us will be ashamed to say, "Yes, but these people killed the Turks."

Most of these people did not kill anyone.

These people became the innocent victims of a crazed government powered by murder, pitiless but also totally incompetent in governing.

This bloody insanity was a barbarism, not something for us to take pride in or be part of.

This was a slaughter that we should be ashamed of, and, if possible, something that we can sympathize with and share the pain.

I understand that the word "genocide" has a damningly critical meaning, based on the relentless insistence of the Armenians' "Accept the Genocide" argument, or the Turks' "No, it was not a genocide" counterargument, even though the Turks accept the death of hundreds of thousands of Armenians.

And yet, this word is not that important for me, even though it has significance in politics and diplomacy.

What is more important for me is the fact that many innocent people were killed so barbarically.

When I see the shadow of this bloody event on the present world, I see a greater injustice done to the Armenians.

Our crime today is not to allow the present Armenians even to grieve for their cruelly killed relatives and parents.

Which Armenian living in Turkey today can openly grieve and commemorate a murdered grandmother, grandfather or uncle?

I have nothing in common with the terrible sin of the past Ittihadists, but the sin of not allowing grief for the dead belongs to all of us today.

Do you really want to commit this sin?

Is there anyone among us who would not shed tears for a family attacked at home in the middle of the night, or for a little girl left all alone in the desert during the nightmare called "deportation," or for a white-bearded grandfather shot?

Whether you call it genocide or not, hundreds of thousands of human beings were murdered.

Hundreds of thousands of lives snuffed out.

The fact that some Armenian gangs murdered some Turks cannot be an excuse to mask the truth that hundreds of thousands of Armenians were murdered.

A human being of conscience is capable of grieving for the Armenians, as well as the Turks, as well as the Kurds.

We all should.

Babies died; women and old people died.

They died in pain, tormented, terrified.

Is it really so important what religion or race these murdered people had?

Even in these terrifying times there were Turks who risked their lives trying to rescue Armenian children.

We are the children of these rescuers, as well as the children of the murderers.

Instead of justifying and arguing on behalf of the murderers, why don't we praise and defend the rescuers' compassion, honesty, and courage?

There are no more victims left to be rescued today, but there is a grief, a pain, to be shared and supported.

What's the use of a bloody, warmongering dance around a deep pain?

Forget the numbers, forget the Armenians, forget the Turks, just think of the babies, teenagers, and old people with necks broken, bellies slashed, bodies mutilated. Think about these people, one by one.

If nothing moves in you when you hear a baby wail as her mother is murdered, I have nothing to say to you.

Then add my name to the list of "traitors."

Because I am ready to share the grief and pain with the Armenians.

Because I still believe there is something yet to be rescued from all these meaningless and pitiless arguments, and that something is called "humanity."

Tha translation has serious flaws to defend a thesis, Altan recognises the fact that more than 500 thousand Muslims have been murdered by the armenian gangs during the troubled times, as well.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.109.98.30|75.109.98.30]] ([[User talk:75.109.98.30|talk]]) 21:06, 16 October 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Opening statement on the definition of 'genocide' ==

The old statement defined genocide as the "mass killing" of a group.  This is not an accurate summary either of scholarly consensus or international law.  In both the CPPCG and in Raphael Lemkin's original 1944 formulation, mass killing is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for genocide.  In the CPPCG definition, for example, one could be guilty of genocide for forcibly removing the children of a national group with an intent to prevent that national group from reproducing itself (as happened to many First Nations groups in Canada, for example; although the Canadian state has not been charged with genocide, in principle it could be). In scholarly and activist literature, some authors defend the association of genocide with mass killing while others insist on a multidimensional conception of genocide.  It is more "NPOV", so to speak, to introduce genocide as the "intentional destruction" of a group; this phrase is a bit ambiguous but that ambiguity is proper to the term as it is currently used. -- [[User:Daedalus71|Christopher Powell]] 23:15, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

I've changed "deliberate and systematic extermination" to substitute "destruction" for extermination and removed the OED citation.  The Oxford English Dictionary for once is not authoritative, and in fact wrong.  Neither the CPPCG, nor Lemkin's writing, equate genocide with physical extermination.  Under the CPPCG, killing does not have to happen at all for genocide to take place.  There are many scholars who disagree and define genocide in terms of mass killing, but there are also many who do not.  The opening statement should be reasonably inclusive. [[User:Daedalus71|Christopher Powell]] 23:18, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

:I have reverted the change. The legal opinions expressed this year have clearly shown that the legal definition of genocide involves the physical killing of a group (or "[[Genocide#In part|part]]" of a group). See for example the European Court of Human Rights judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on 12 July 2007: ''As the ICTY has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' ' (Krstić, IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide.''(ECHR Paragraph 45, quoting the ICJ ([http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/search.asp?skin=hudoc-en search on "Jorgic v. Germany"])). -- [[User:Philip Baird Shearer|Philip Baird Shearer]] 08:33, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

::I've undone the revert.  Sorry to be stubborn, but this is an important and slippery point.  Destruction, even physical destruction, is not the same thing as extermination.  At issue is the question of whether genocide is understood as a process the object of which is more than a collection of individuals - a culture, a shared or communal existence, a 'social fact' in the Durkheimian sense - or whether genocide is 'only' the killing of individuals  chosen for killing because of their group membership.  Raphael Lemkin very clearly understood his own concept in terms of the former sense; the Convention is not inconsistent with such an interpretation; the point continues to be contested among scholars (e.g. Jean-Paul Sartre, Tony Barta, Thompson and Quets, Ward Churchill, Dirk Moses, etc.) and in general use.  

::This is particularly relevant in debates over genocides against indigenous peoples by settler societies, especially liberal-democratic settler societies that have not consistently sought the total physical extermination of their indigenous populations.  I recognize that individualist definitions of genocide that reduce the term to one form or another of mass killing tend to predominate, especially in the U.S. literature, but the question is far from settled and I think that too specific a definition violates NPOV.

== Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings ==

:Well, it wasn't aimed to target the Japanese people specifically, and in fact many more suffered (Koreans, American POWs), but you should consult reliable sources rather than fellow Wikipedians.

Some of these "Preventive measures" for the Stages of Genocide sound inconsistent with some of the freedoms expected in a liberal democracy. I mean, "Hate radio stations should be shut down, and hate propaganda banned."? America and alot of other Western developed nations don't ban the Neo-Nazis from spewing their slime.

== Are identity cards a necessary step for genocides? ==

I just read that the Soviets required mandatory registration and issued identity cards to prevent Ukrainians from fleeing the [[Holodomor]] in December 1932.  This reminds me of how the Nazis used identity documents to determine who was Jewish, and the Rwandans used them not just to determine but practically to ''define'' who was [[Hutu]] and who was [[Tutsi]].  The "stages of genocide" document presented describes such steps as classification and organization as general processes in a racist context, but it occurs to me that these processes more typically (though not always) occur first in the ostensibly neutral context of identifying and tracking the population at large, and only later turn out to be very helpful in facilitating mass murder.  It follows that the originating source of genocides is not the tiny racist group with its propaganda, but the general social policy that classifies human beings as objects that must be tagged and controlled.  Do you suppose this is correct? [[Special:Contributions/70.15.116.59|70.15.116.59]] ([[User talk:70.15.116.59|talk]]) 17:19, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

== Greek and Assyrian Genocide recognised ==

IAGS Officially Recognizes Greek Genocide (1914-1922) In a groundbreaking move, the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) has voted overwhelmingly to recognize the genocides inflicted on '''Assyrian and Greek populations''' of the Ottoman Empire between 1914 and 1923.

The resolution passed with the support of fully 83 percent of IAGS members who voted. The resolution (text below) declares that "it is the conviction of the International Association of Genocide Scholars that the Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted''' a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontian and Anatolian Greeks'''." It "calls upon the government of Turkey to acknowledge the genocides against these populations, to '''issue a formal apology, and to take prompt and meaningful steps toward restitution."'''

In 1997, the IAGS officially recognized the Armenian genocide. The current resolution notes that while activist and scholarly efforts have resulted in widespread acceptance of the Armenian genocide, there has been "little recognition of the qualitatively similar genocides against other Christian minorities of the Ottoman Empire ." Assyrians, along with Pontian and Anatolian Greeks, were killed on a '''scale equivalent''' in per capita terms to the catastrophe inflicted on the Armenian population of the empire -- and by much the same methods, including mass executions, death marches, and starvation.

IAGS member Adam Jones drafted the resolution, and lobbied for it along with fellow member Thea Halo, whose mother Sano survived the Pontian Greek genocide. In an address to the membership at the IAGS conference in Sarajevo, Bosnia, in July 2007, Jones paid tribute to the efforts of "representatives of the Greek and Assyrian communities ... to publicize and call on the present Turkish government to acknowledge the genocides inflicted on their populations," which had made Asia Minor their home for millennia. The umbrella term "Assyrians" includes Chaldeans, Nestorians, Syriacs, Aramaens, Eastern Orthodox Syrians, and Jacobites.

"The overwhelming backing given to this resolution by the world's leading genocide scholars organization will help to raise consciousness about the Assyrian and Greek genocides," Jones said on December 15. "It will also act as a powerful counter to those, especially in present-day Turkey , who still ignore or deny outright the genocides of the Ottoman Christian minorities."

The resolution stated that "the denial of genocide is widely recognized as the final stage of genocide, enshrining impunity for the perpetrators of genocide, and demonstrably paving the way for future genocides." The Assyrian population of Iraq , for example, remains highly vulnerable to genocidal attack. Since 2003, Iraqi Assyrians have been exposed to severe persecution and "ethnic cleansing"; it is believed that up to half the Assyrian population has fled the country.

FULL TEXT OF THE IAGS RESOLUTION:

Quote:
WHEREAS the denial of genocide is widely recognized as the final stage of genocide, enshrining impunity for the perpetrators of genocide, and demonstrably paving the way for future genocides;

WHEREAS the Ottoman genocide against minority populations during and following the First World War is usually depicted as a genocide against Armenians alone, with little recognition of the qualitatively similar genocides against other Christian minorities of the Ottoman Empire ;

BE IT RESOLVED that it is the conviction of the International Association of Genocide Scholars that the Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontian and Anatolian Greeks.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Association calls upon the government of Turkey to acknowledge the genocides against these populations, to issue a formal apology, and to take prompt and meaningful steps toward restitution.

===CORRECTION===
No, the information that you claim here is false and merely is a collection of falsified information that you gathered from the web to reflect your personal twisted opinion. The UN definition of genocide and any related decisions only refer to events during WWII  and post-WWII. The declarations that you cite here also are neither objective nor from valid institutions. The IAGS is a politically motivated organization that disrespects the history beyond comprehension and lacks the ethical framework to produce valid and reliable resolutions. IAGS is a "weeping wall" if you will, where nations that lost wars seek to recuperate their financial losses and social humiliation by passing resolutions to press the winner nations to secede a portion of their wealth and to publicly apologize. They do not have any scientific credibility and their sources of income is from the very countries that claim their population to have experienced genocide. The conflict of interest alone precludes IAGS from being taken seriously in the international arena, except of course by the countries that pay for the salaries of those scholars.

== Lead section (intro) ==

I completely agree with the HTML comment after the lead section. It would be great if it could be rewritten - the legal definition moved into the main part of the article and be replaced with a summary of the rest of the article.

I think that the legal definition is pretty wordy, and doesn't add massively important points to the first sentence; it could be rephrased in a way that's more easy to understand and shorter; the full definition is more specialist and would fit better in the main part (to help towards complete knowledge rather than a summary).

== A Moral Hierarchy of Evil: The UN's Genocide Loophole ==

In the references section, I have added [[Jonah Goldberg]]'s [http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JonahGoldberg/2008/04/09/the_genocide_loophole The Genocide Loophole], in which the author states that the bias inherent in the [[UN]]'s genocide law "leaves the greatest mass murderers of the 20th century — self-described Marxist-Leninists — somewhat off the hook." Indeed, the U.N.-style definition of genocide amounts to "a moral hierarchy of evil, which in effect renders mass murder a second-tier crime if it's done in the name of social progress, modernization or other [[Enlightenment]] ideals." 

[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JonahGoldberg/2008/04/09/the_genocide_loophole Goldberg] adds that this "is dangerous thinking; people perceived to be blocking progress — farmers, aristocrats, reactionaries — can be more forgivably slaughtered than ethnic groups because they're allegedly part of the problem, not the solution. After all, you've got to break some eggs to make an omelet." 

"Today, [[Mao]] and [[Stalin]] aren't in [[Hitler]]'s class of evil because [[Hitler]] wasn't a "modernizer," he was a racist … It's a wrongheaded distinction. [[Murder]] is [[murder]], whether the motive is bigotry or the pursuit of allegedly enlightened [[social planning]]."

:This is rather thought-provoking but I view Stalin as a murderer of 8 million Ukrainians and Mao as a murderer of millions of non-Han Chinese, especially Tibetans. I think the big thing is that a group of farmers that loses a billion can ultimately replenish themselves but an obliterated tribe of a dozen cannot.

1) * * * What follows are related observations extracted from my short book (Ludwik Kowalski, "Hell on Earth: Brutality and Violence Under The Stalinist Regime" Wasteland Press, Shelbyville, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-60047-232-9}}). * * *  
{{collapse top}}
a) Are mass killings avoidable? Hitler's holocaust was based on racism; Stalin's slaughter was based on the concept of class struggle. Can we say that these two ideologies of intolerance are responsible for mass killings? Or should the tragedies be attributed to the evil nature of leaders? The two tyrants were not alone; it is impossible to kill millions without favorable social conditions. Can such conditions be identified? Can they be eliminated? How can this be done? I am not sure how to answer such questions. But I strongly believe that all occurrences of mass genocide should be analyzed and exposed, not hidden or forgotten.
 	
Mass murder occurs when brutal and sadistic criminals, to be found in every society, are promoted to positions of dominance, when propaganda is used to dehumanize the targeted population and when children are inoculated with intolerance and hatred. It occurs when victims ("inferior races" or "class enemies") are excluded from the norms of morality, when ideological totalitarianism is imposed and when freedom is suspended. Fear and violence, the preconditions of genocide, are likely to be found in societies with large numbers of thieves and informants. . . .
  	
b) Is moral sensitivity of people sufficient to protect world societies from mass murderers? Probably not. What else is essential? Elimination of extreme poverty and injustice. How can this be accomplished? Many sociologists have asked this question. Karl Marx was one of them. He believed that the "proletarian dictatorship" was the answer. I suspect that the 20th century will be named after this kind of dictatorship. The idea was tried in many countries and failed. It did not create justice; it replaced old tyrants with more brutal tyrants. Lenin, Stalin and Mao are well known examples.

So where is the answer? I do not know. Is man's inhumanity to man avoidable? Perhaps not, perhaps it should be accepted as part of human nature. If this is accepted then episodes of mass murder can be compared with other calamities, like epidemics, earthquakes and wars. (The black death epidemic did kill about one third of Europe's population in the Middle Ages; the Aids epidemic is rampant today; disasters caused by global warming are predicted, etc.) But scientific understanding of epidemics has often resulted in great improvements. Likewise, constructing less vulnerable buildings, or avoiding certain locations, can minimize consequences of earthquakes. What happened in the Soviet Union should not be attributed only to Stalin's despotic inclinations; it should also be attributed to the ideology he inherited from Lenin.

We do not accept natural disasters passively; we do everything possible to prevent them, or at least to reduce their undesirable consequences. Why should man's inhumanity to man be accepted as unavoidable? Humanity is also part of nature. Most people want justice and deplore suffering. Shouldn't this be the basis for working toward elimination of man-made calamities?

== Areas overlooked, left out: theoretical explanations, post-genocidal states, etc ==

Hello all. I have taken a look at this article and it appears, as aforementioned, that it lacks some areas of discussion that are fairly critical to the topic. First, why is 90% of this article centered around genocide as defined by law? This approach is rather narrow and looks at genocide from a viewpoint that fails to take into account the breadth of the violent acts involved. When a user commented on miscegenation as genocidal, it was turned away because it did not fit the proper legal definition. But you would be hard pressed to not call rape on a mass scale (given certain preconditions) genocidal. I also think that academia has a better grasp of this concept than what is written into law. After all, General Dallaire asserted that a meager few thousand troops would be able to halt the genocide in Rwanda as it reached its peak in 1994, yet the UN failed to acknowledge these crimes. Now nearly a million are dead. Why base an article on an institution that has failed miserably (or not even tried) to enforce its laws? Maybe I'm just pushing an agenda here, but it doesn't really make sense to me. This legal definition seems to have left a few genocides out of the list. The killing of Armenians by Young Turks, Ukrainians by the USSR, those by the Khmer Rouge, and the murdering of the indigenous peoples of Guatamalan by the counterinsurgency there, which was also aided by the United States. Speaking of the United States, how has the murder of Native Americans fallen outside of the scope of genocide? This article disgusts me. You should make this addition: that people won't recognize genocide if it is not large-scale, or if it doesn't show overt mass-killings, or if it is perpetrated by the Western world. 

This leads me to my second question, which was mentioned by another user. Where are the theoretical explanations of genocide? One of the prominent theories is openly disputed, wrongly, by the introduction. The U.N. states that genocide occurred throughout history? What history? Where is the citation for this? Because it's plain bullshit. There is little evidence of genocide occurring in history; it's a modern event. This is fairly established in the academic world, by those who actually study war, violence, and its forms. I don't see why this article lacks reference to Goldhagen or Zygmunt Bauman. Genocide is a modern event only made possible by modernity which represents the purest form of humanity in its modern form. 

Third, there is a weak reference to some sort of genocidal prevention rubric, which is nonsense, yet there is no mention of the study of post-genocidal states? 

Sorry for the way I put these points across, and looking over them now I will not make edits. This article is unimpressive. I don't expect any wikipedia article to cover the whole scope of any concept, but the article about Jay Cutler is more extensive. And he's only been in the NFL for 2.3 seasons. --[[User:Mtoyama|Mtoyama]] ([[User talk:Mtoyama|talk]]) 23:33, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

== Blanking and tag ==

I don't understand the "dubious" tag on the Spanish judicial definition of genocide, nor the blanking of the explanation of the in-built political limitations on the UN Security Council's efficacy in preventing or even ameliorating genocide. 

[[User:Lapsed Pacifist|Lapsed Pacifist]] ([[User talk:Lapsed Pacifist|talk]]) 18:54, 16 January 2009 (UTC)

:The Spanish source is several years out of date. It may well be true but a much more up to date source is needed because by now some of the arguments will have been discussed in depth. I did a quick search but all the sources I looked at were as old as the one listed. In the next day or so I'll see if I can find a more up to date one.

:The position of the UN Security council is a bit more complicated than the sentence added implies. It is not that they have a veto, it is also that without the active support of some of the permanent members, it is very unlikely that the UN has the strength to do anything (even if the permanent members do not use their veto). Although this is well known it is OR without a source. I think a better option is to mention  how the ICC can only investigate the situation in a country if invited to do so by the state (as has happened in Uganda) or if the Security Council requests the ICC to do so under Article 13.b of the Rome Statute. The Security Council has done this for the first time over the situation in Darfur which may be a big step forward in Genocide prevention.

What is more useful if you wish to progress this line of argument (although because Rozanski recognised it to be controversial, it should be attributed to him "Carlos Rozanski's has stated ...") is the last paragraph and in particular the footnote on page 101. But I think the place to put it is in the section as a stand alone paragraph in the "Criticisms of the CPPCG and other definitions of genocide" section after the Barbara Harff paragraph and before the Rummel paragraph, not in the lead.

== Intervention ==

I have removed the following under [[WP:V]] because there are no citations:
:'''''A country which recognizes that what another country does is genocide, may take action and intervene. However, there is no well-accepted doctrine of 'humanitarian intervention' in international law, and such forcible intervention may infringe the prohibition on the use of force. '''The Genocide Convention only provides that the State on whose territory the crime of genocide is committed, or an international penal tribunal, may prosecute the perpetrators of genocide. Other States do not have an obligation to prosecute them, but may do so under their domestic penal laws. Indeed, each Contracting Party to the Genocide Convention must enact legislation in order to criminalise and punish acts of genocide. States are of course able to bring the matter before the Security Council, which is empowered to take forcible enforcement measures in accordance with international law in order to stop genocidal acts.''(my emphasis)

Using the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/genocide.htm Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; December 9, 1948] I see that there are several article which have a bearing on this:
*Article 3: The definition
*Article 5:''The Contracting Parties undertake to enact, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention and, in particular, to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3.''
*Article 6:''Persons charged with genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the State in the territory of which the act was committed, or by such international penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction with respect to those Contracting Parties which shall have accepted its jurisdiction.
*Article 7: Says that a party to the convention will grant extradition in accordance with their laws and treaties in force.

AFAICT none of the above has the implication that the first two sentences of the article paragraph implies. I think the author(s) of the sentences was/were confused by Article 8 which says:
:Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3.
This is far from ''take action and intervene'' as understood by the second sentence of the paragraph. --[[User:Philip Baird Shearer|Philip Baird Shearer]] 09:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

The paragraph grew from this initial edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genocide&diff=53513662&oldid=53513446 Revision as of 14:55, 16 May 2006] by the IP number [[Special:Contributions/219.78.35.222]].

:In the early vision of how the UN was supposed to function (before the Cold War and its effects on international relations had become obvious) there was a provision that the UN would be able to muster a "UN Armed Forces" to which most all member states would contribute. This temporary military branch would be stronger than any one member state, including the Superpowers, and so it would be able to enforce the wishes of the UN community. that was an illusion, of course. After 1948 it became clear that the UN would not be able to rival any major national power in battle by itself, and never in the heat of a crisis that directly involved the two superpwers. During the same era (around 1950) the idea of an international court - a continuation of Nuremberg - was quietly dropped. It simply wasn't practical, and it would clearly become a latent threat to any of the leading UN powers. [[User:Strausszek|Strausszek]] ([[User talk:Strausszek|talk]]) 22:05, 23 March 2010 (UTC)

Why is it so difficult to find the words "Native American" or "Indian" in combination with "genocide" or "holocaust" at this so-called "encyclopedia"?

Please take a look at edits and reverts that have plagued me on the "Population history of American indigenous peoples". The title should be your first clue. It was originally titled Native American Genocide, but since then has been turned into the meaningless title above. Read the talk page and it soon becomes clear that anything written that even implies that Native Americans were the victim of genocide, including items carefully documented and sourced will soon be taken off by a band of folks who refuse to allow anything less than their own view of events.

:::Genocide as described in this article is based on the common usage which is based on the Genocide Convention. The debate about America and Tasmania depends in part on using other definitions of genocide. In the  the section "[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cAoM4F6Il9kC&pg=PA26&dq=Relations+of+Genocide:+Land+and+Lives+in+the+Colonization+of+Australia#PPA23,M1 Rival Paradigms of Genocide]" in ''Genocide and Settler Society: Frontier Violence and Stolen Indigenous Children in Australian History'' By A. Dirk Moses, Berghahn Books, 2004 {{ISBN|1571814116}}, 9781571814111, Moss makes a distinction between "Intentionalists" (''intentional genocide'' like the Holocaust) and "structuralists" (''structural genocide'' which "averts the issue of perpetrator agency and intention by highlighting anonymous 'genocidal processes' of cultural and physical destruction.") Moss goes on to say that "The dominant approach has been the Intentionalist one, because until recently genocide studies has been virtually monopolized by North American social scientists. [Which] ... frames the Holocaust as the prototypical genocide" ... "The intentionalist view has lost ground among genocide scholars, but still suffuses the popular imagination" (he footnotes this as 123 which can be found on page 45 and cites 5 papers). The trouble with this last comment is while it may be true among comparative genocide scholars, legal scholars' definition of the crime of genocide has been going the other way (tightening up the definition) thanks to the trials of the monsters involved in the Bosnian and Rwanda genocides (see [[Bosnian Genocide]] article).

:::If this type of distinction is made then it is possible to discuss structural genocides, like the Tasmanian genocide as Benjamin Madley  does using the term "Frontier Genocide ([http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/Madley.pdf "Patterns of frontier genocide 1803–1910: the Aboriginal Tasmanians, the Yuki of California, and the Herero of Namibia"] by Benjamin Madley in the ''Journal of Genocide Research'' (2004), 6(2), June, 167–192).  I do not think that we should go into this branch of Genocide studies in this article vecause, (1) as it is not mainstream and there is no general agreement among scholars, (2) this article is already large enouth and as we have another article [[Genocides in history]] which lists other genocides where this type of debate can be summarised and linked to other more detailed articles which can be written if editors are consider it desirable. --[[User:Philip Baird Shearer|PBS]] ([[User talk:Philip Baird Shearer|talk]]) 13:46, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

:::See the paragraph in this article that starts "Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson ... non of these [[genocide definitions|alternative definitions]] have gained widespread support for various reasons." There is no widespread agreement that the events in America or Australia were genocides (because one has to use an alternative definition to the Genocide Convention which does not include "[[Genocide#Intent to destroy|intent]]". We have an article in which we list genocides and events that some describe as genocides. In this article we have restricted the listed entries to those which have been found to be genocides in an international court of law, as few dispute that those are genocides. One could argue that the the Holocaust should not be listed, but men and women were found guilty in national and international courts of law for crimes against humanity and the German successor state acknowledges that the actions carried out in the name of the state was a genocide, so I think it should be included.

:::I have to defer to PBS and anyone else who has reliable sources, but the distinction between intentional and structural genocide strikes me as fishy.  It was not until relatively late in the Nazi regime that the Nazi's settled on the systematic annihalation of Jews as policy ... a good deal of the Jews killed (maybe a third?) that occured during the invasion of Russia in territories between Germany and the German/Russian lines could by the definition given be called "structural genocide" and from what I have seen the genocide of Tasmanians was most definitely intentional.  I think this article should take a broader view and if need be use diferent trends in Genocide studies ''as well as'' Native American studies and other scholars, in history or anthropology, who are not called scholars of Genocide studies and do not publish in journals of genocid studies but who nevertheless write about victims of genocide - I think we have to accept these scholars as reliable too.  Yes, we should distinguish betweeen mainstream, majority, and minority views but what is the majority view can vary from one discipline to another, and also there sometimes is a long ways between a minority view and a ''fringe'' view, and in such cases minority views must be represented.

::::The Tasmanian extinction is a much more complicated example than it first appears, and as it happens it is comparative genocide scholars who tend to view it as a genocide while Australian historians who specialise in Tasmanian history do not.

Tasmania is not a one off example, the article [[genocides in history]] list several others, and one a with very similar profile of comparative genocide scholars suggesting it is, and historians suggesting it is not, is the [[Genocides in history#France|War in the Vendée]].

After the HOLOCAUST it's hard to understand, but during WW1 the German occupied Jew communities in Eastern Europe saw the German soldiers widely as liberators from the czarist regime with its numerous pogroms! No genocide at all! The situation was totally different to WW2!

This doesn't mean, that there was no anti-Semitism among the non-Jewish German soldiers at that time. Religious prejudices had unimmunized for the massive propaganda of the next decades.

:The Genocide Treaty came into existence as a result of the atrocities committed during the second word War.

He cited mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman empire in World War I and other mass killings in history. He was ignored."[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN0934951820070410] So I think a picture of the Holocaust is appropriate. --[[User:Philip Baird Shearer|PBS]] ([[User talk:Philip Baird Shearer|talk]]) 10:49, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Sorry Henrig, you are referring to the treatment of Jews in Eastern Europe. I concur with your view. I should have specified that I was referring to the Jews in Palestine with such events as the Ottoman expulsion of the Jews of Tel Aviv and such. Many genocidal acts by the Ottomans were under the auspices of, with support by, or with the complicity of the Germans. The WWII Holocaust was made possible by German observation of the Armenian Genocide. Hitler even said, "After all, who today speaks of the Armenians." when propounding his "Final Solution".

:Say what, PBS? Is this article about "genocide" or "The Genocide Treaty"? I completely understand such a Buchenwald photo prefacing an article on the Genocide Treaty but Holocaust Studies is a mammoth subject with  museums globally dedicated to it. Focussing on antisemitism and the Holocaust in this context narrows the point-of-view the audience is exposed to. We are doing them a great disservice if the articles of all hate crimes, and such, pictorally focus on the same set of victims. I am genetically, spiritually, and financially deeply enmeshed in the Ashkenazic Diaspora. This year alone I privately prayed in and donated to the Holocaust section of the Auckland Museum, donated to and openly wept in the Washington Holocaust Museum, and am preparing to visit Jerusalem. The Holocaust is an immensely important subject that cannot be ignored globally, or in this article, but we must not focus on this alone. Ottoman Armenia begat the study of genocide and also coincidentally warranted one of the earliest "New York Times" mentions of the word, "holocaust".

I can understand, when Armenians throughout the world claim, to remember their history. The same should be accepted for all ethnic groups, who once were targets of such terrible incidents. 

But concerning the picture, I'd say, the best picture would be a picture, that refers to a current threat of a genocide!
It's unbelievable, that few years ago such terrible thing as the [[Rwandan Genocide]] could occur, by reason that the world public wasn't aware of it. 

For instance, a picture with Africans as victims of former slave hunters would be convenient, if there would be such a threat today. But such or a similar threat doesn't exist. Does it? 
But what about [[War in Darfur]] ? Some people even fear a genocide there. Is this a real danger?

Holocaust is the most widely known form of genocide so far. Since we're talking about [[encyclopedia]] here, why would you want to replace that picture with something else?

Holocaust is not only the most widely known form of genocide! It was the only time, that someone used the means of industrialization for effective mass murder. But a picture of Buchenwald doesn't typifies this. Before the end of 1944 Buchenwald for the most time was the hell on earth with high death rates too, but predominantly it was used, to torment all kinds of political prisoners and was no death factory for mass murder like Auschwitz. A picture of Auschwitz would be more convenient, to clarify this!

Such a picture refers to the possible extend of a genocide and should be in this article too. But in the case of a real danger of a genocide today, a convenient picture about could clarify the actuality of a danger!

--[[User:Henrig|Henrig]] ([[User talk:Henrig|talk]]) 21:48, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:I concur with [[User:Henrig]]. The industrialization of genocide as typified in Auschwitz took genocide to a level somewhat beyond that of tying a dozen naked Armenians together and saving bullets by shooting just one so that all would drown by his dead weight or forcing an entire Armenian village into a cave known to have only the one aperature and then starting a blaze at the entrance to suffocate them all to death in WWI gas chambers. As such, a picture of the suffering at Auschwitz might be effective to highlight the deadly efficiency that might be brought back to genocide. Similarly more recent photos in living colour and high definition would keep the novices in the audience from misinterpreting genocide as a thing merely of the past. It is paramount to indicate that the "never again" has never ended.

:I'm just re-reading [[user:Philip Baird Shearer]]'s first response here. After his reference on Raphael Lemkin, he seems to indicate that he believes because the Armenians after WWI weren't as effective as the Jews after WWII at highlighting their genocide to stop future genocides, the Armenian massacres were somehow unimportant. I'd like to remind him that the League of Nations failed not only to prevent genocide but also to entice US congress to ratify and join and also to prevent WWII from occurring. It hardly seems a fair comparison. Though the Genocide Treaty was a magnificent milestone, it didn't prevent genocidal murder in Yugoslavia right within Europe. Neither did it abolish the Jim Crow laws of the US that were shown in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka to severely impede the basic education of African-Americans, one of the best known means to sustain a community, increasing its ability to provide for itself, which one might argue were: 
:(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
:(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
:The treaty didn't even stop Australia from counting Aborigines as not only non-citizens but as fauna. Just as a discussion of democracy should include but not limit its scope to one great document like the Magna Carta, which helped on the path to the devolution of powers but saw more growth through the Declaration of Independence and Lafayette's wars, we must not contain our scope of genocide merely within the confines of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and its immediate causes and effects despite its instrumental importance historically. :|--[[User:Thecurran|Thecurran]] ([[User talk:Thecurran|talk]]) 02:35, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

I think the Buchenwald photo quite out of place. It doesn't show anyone being killed or having been killed.  There's a picture of corpses being burnt, generally considered to come from Auschwitz, which would be far more appropriate, if it is available.  The idea that the terrible conditions in concentration camps, found by advancing Americans, are evidence of mass murder planned by top Nazis is misleading and has served to confuse Nazi Holocaust studies ever since.

The violent crime in SA against whites is actively encouraged, endorsed, supported and perpetuated by the ANC terrorist regime as nothing less than retribution for apartheid.

The senior ANC terrorists are as complicit in each and every atrocity committed against the white minority as their free-agents on the ground who are clearly perpetrating such atrocities on expressed or implied instruction from the ANC terrorist hierarchy as part of the broader, ongoing strategy of the genocide of whites which has been cunningly disguised by liberals as crime.

Julius Malema may be facing a genocide charge at the international court of Justice in Hague, in the Netherlands.

Ethnocide is a concept related to genocide. Primarily, the term, close to cultural genocide, is used to describe the destruction of a culture of a people, as opposed to the people themselves. It may involve a [[linguicide]], phenomenons of [[acculturation]], etc. Furthermore, by contrast with a genocide, an ethnocide is not necessarily intentional. However, unlike genocide, which has entered into [[international law]], ethnocide remains primarily the province of [[ethnologist]]s, who have not yet settled on a single cohesive meaning for the term. 

[[Raphael Lemkin]], the linguist and lawyer who coined genocide in 1943 as the union of "the Greek word ''genos'' (race, tribe) and the Latin ''cide'' (killing)", also suggested ethnocide as an alternative form representing the same concept, using the Greek ''ethnos'' (nation) in place of ''genos''.<ref>Lemkin, Raphael. [http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/AxisRule1944-1.htm Acts Constituting a General (Transnational) Danger Considered as Offences Against the Law of Nations]. Published 14 October 1933. Accessed 21 May 2007.</ref> It does not appear to have entered into wide usage at the time. Subsequently, ethnocide has been used by some ethnologists to refer to a sub-type of genocide. While the [[United Nations]]' 1951 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] defines genocide as acts committed against "national, ethnical, racial or religious" groups, ethnocide, taken in this context, would refer only to crimes motivated by ethnicity.

Another definition in use in some writings suggests that ethnocide could refer to actions which do not lead directly to death or harm of living members of a group, but instead have the long-term effect of reducing birthrates, interfering with education or transmission of culture to future generations of a group, or erasing the group's existence or practices from the historical record. This usage is commonly found in discussions of oppressed indigenous peoples and is sometimes referred to as ''culturecide''. Under the UN Convention, some of these practices could also overlap with legal definitions of genocide, such as prevention of births within a group or forcibly transferring the children of one ethnic group to another group.

Although international [[genocide law]] focuses primarily on direct violent and repressive actions, Lemkin, in his writings, considered genocide to be a crime above all others not only because of the numbers of persons killed or injured, but because genocide carried with it the intent to render entire, irreplaceable cultures extinct. The broader definition of ethnocide may be useful in addressing perceived shortcomings and restrictions of genocide law and in identifying cultural destruction when it occurs by less violent and less visible means.

The French ethnologist [[Robert Jaulin]] (1928–1996) redefined the concept of ethnocide in 1970 with his ground-breaking ''La paix blanche : introduction à l’ethnocide'' ("White Peace: Introduction to Ethnocide"). This capital work, which remains to be translated into English, gives a detailed account of the ethnocide-in-motion suffered by the [[Bari]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] people living on the border between [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]], in the second half of the sixties, as witnessed by Robert Jaulin himself. Whether conflicting or collaborating among themselves, multiple vectors of ethnocide in place (the [[Roman Catholic Church and colonialism|Catholic Church]] and other Christian confessions, the Venezuelan and the Colombian armies, the US [[petroleum company]] [[Colpet]], and all the “little colonists” as Jaulin calls them) converged to the relentless disavowal and destruction of Bari’s culture and society.

In Jaulin’s understanding of the notion, it is not the ''means'' but the ''ends'' that define ethnocide. Accordingly, the ethnocide would be the systematic destruction of the thought and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the ethnocide kills them in their spirit.

Collective and arbitrary murder, systematic abduction of children to raise them away from their parent’s culture, active and degrading religious propaganda, forced work, expulsion from the homeland or compulsory abandonment of cultural habits and social structure, all these practices, described by Jaulin, have in common a deep despise for the other man and woman as representatives of a different cultural world.

Along with a detailed description and analysis of Bari’s case, ''La paix blanche'' is also a broad reflection on [[Western culture|Western civilization]]’s tendency to ignore, lower and destroy other cultural worlds as it comes in touch with them, while extending its own domain, bringing the focus of the discussion back from the frontiers of Western civilization to its core and its history. As he takes his inquiry back in time, Jaulin shows that the way the West relates to other civilizations is a continuation of the way it has always related to its own inner cultural diversity, from the monotheistic exclusion of the representatives of different and differing cultural spaces (the “other” gods, divinities, entities, etc.) to its reinstatement under the successive garments of Reason, Revolution, Progress or Science.

A long reflection on the dynamics that led to worldwide ethnocide, its different “masks”, its history and, according to him, one of its earliest manifestations, [[monotheism]], led Jaulin to a complete reappraisal of the phenomenal and conceptual fields polarized by the notion of ethnocide. 

This reassessment took its final shape in the 1995’s work, ''L’univers des totalitarismes : Essai d’ethnologie du “non-être”'' (in free translation: "The Universe of Totalitarianisms: An Ethnological Essay on “Non-Being”"). In this book, the notion of “totalitarianism” (which should not be mistaken for [[Hannah Arendt]]’s concept of [[totalitarianism]]) depicts the underlying dynamics of which ethnocide becomes a manifestation among others.

Jaulin defines totalitarianism as an abstract ''scheme'' or ''machine'' of non-relation to cultural otherness characterized by the expansion of "oneself " ("''soi''") through an election/exclusion logic. The totalitarian machine operates by splitting the universe into its own “agents” on the one side, and its “objects” on the other, whether they be individuals, families, groups, societies or whole civilizations. It proceeds by depriving the later of their quality of ''cultural subjects'' through the erosion and finally the suppression of their space of tradition and cultural invention, which mediates their relation with themselves, i.e. their reflexivity. With the mutilation of their “field of cultural potentialities”, as Jaulin calls it, the totalitarian dynamics transforms its “objects” into new “agents” of expansion, reduced to a mock self-relation defined by the horizon of a potential ''election''. However, to become actual this election needs to articulate with a pole of ''exclusion''; thus the need of a new expansion of this universe of non-relation, the ''universe of totalitarianisms'', by definition an endlessly expanding universe whose theoretical limits paradoxically coincide with its own self-destruction.

The election/exclusion logics works by means of pairs of contradictory and, therefore, mutually exclusive terms. Their content may be as varied as the different semantic domains invested by the totalitarian machine: chosen/doomed, religion/magic, truth/falseness, literate/illiterate, savage/civilized, subject/object, intellectual/manual, [[proletarian]]s/[[capitalist]]s, science/illusion, subjectivity/objectivity, etc. In all these contradictory pairs, one of the poles “means” to occupy the whole field; but at the same time, its own meaning and “existence” depends on the virtually excluded pole.

According to Jaulin, the asymmetrical relation portrayed by these pairs is but the starting point of totalitarian movement, its static and temporary position. Its dynamics derives from the “wished for” or prospective ''inversion'' of the relation between its two poles. This may happen through the totalitarian pair defining the pre-existing situation, the design of a new one or, more often, through recovery and adaptation of old formulas.

The recovery of the [[Marxist]] proletarian/capitalistic contradictory pair or the even older monotheistic chosen/doomed couple by many independence or charismatic movements in the former European colonies as a means of inverting the pre-existing totalitarian field is an instance of the shifts through which the “totalitarian trajectory” reinvents itself. This example also shows the place of ethnocide within the overall totalitarian dynamics as the dialectical alternate to totalitarian inversion.

Such an inexorable and elementary logic, with its ability to migrate to, pervade and finally destroy ever-differing cultural and social worlds, accounts for the endlessly restarted trajectory of totalitarianism’s two-pole field through time and space.

I have moved the section "Ethnocide" from article space to here because the section carries only one minor citation and seems to be OR.

I feel the definition of Genocide in this article is too narrow.  It does not include non-ethnic genocide i.e/ LGTB please come up with a definition that includes groups beyond ethnicity, and the other terms stated currently, and use a term that can include the LGTB, as well as others that might not fit the definition.

{{POV}}

I would kindly like to inform you about the ongoing white genocide in the Republic of South-Africa. Since 1994, the end of the so-called Apartheid, whites people, especially white farmers, have been subject to extremely brutal and racist murders. About 50 people on average are murdered in South-Africa per day, of which at least 20 of them are whites(95+ % black on white murder rate). Please take into consideration that white people make up only 9% (4 500 000) of the demographics in South-Africa and therefore the white murder rate in South-Africa is quite significant. http://www.genocidewatch.org/southafrica.html

This article is Bias towards the Holocaust and in denial of the White Genocide in South Africa. 

The neutrality of this article is disputed as giving to much attention to the Holocaust and downplaying other holocausts like the The [[Holodomor]] in Ukraine and the white Genocide in South Africa. 

The Genocide in South Africa is being perfected by calling the Genocide "ordinary crime" and ignoring other supporting Genocidal programs like Affirmative Action against a minority.

Here is an example of methods used by Zionists to edit Wikipedia. This method is used to propagandize the Holocaust and downplay the Holodomor, white genocide in South Africa, and other Genocides. The Palestinian Genocide will also not ne noted in this article, and all kinds of junk reasons used to censor the Palestinian Genocide:

I wish to set aside for now the question of the possible final wording of the "Coining of the term" paragraph and am not wedded to my previously proposed wording. 
But I still find the paragraph in question totally unacceptable, your citing the "source" notwithstanding. The lines in the EuropaWorld article are not presented as
explanatory of Lemkin's COINING of the term "genocide". Yet, on the "Genocide" page they are presented as explaining his coining of the term. The result is a distortion.
The 1933 Madrid Conference was indeed part of the history of Lemkin's development of the genocide concept, but it wasn't the genesis of the concept,
let alone the moment the term was coined. The term was coined in 1943 and, as the interview with Quincy Howe clearly shows, the search for the concept began
with the Armenian Genocide. Your response, please.

The following is the "source" provided: http://www.europaworld.org/issue40/raphaellemkin22601.htm  This is a web article which is not a primary source and which does not in turn provide any primary source for the statement it makes concerning the importance of the Simele massacres in the development of Lemkin's thinking. The phrasing of the relevant paragraph as it stands muddies the clear primacy of the Armenian Genocide in Lemkin's thought by referring to the Simele massacres first, then reducing what happened to the Armenians to his  "memories". This is turning the historical reality of the development of the concept on its head. Lemkin was acutely aware of the Armenian Genocide in all its aspects well before 1933.

In terms of eliminating reference to the Assyrians, that is cetainly not the point. The Assyrians can be and should be mentioned on the same page, but in a separate section where the various genocides are listed. The absence of such a section is a glaring
hole in the "Genocide" page. But in terms of the development of the genocide concept in Lemkin's thinking, primacy should be given to the Armenian Genocide, since he made that abundantly clear.

Here is the link for the interview with Lemkin by Quincy Howe which it would be well to include in the article:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCebMq-GmH4

Hello and thanks for your response. The following is your objection to the proposed change:

Not done:  The current source doesn't support that strong a link to the Armenian Genocide and it's not clear what sources you are referencing with [2] and [3]. Thanks, Celestra (talk) 14:00, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

The following is my explanation: 

The lines I propose are taken from the Wikipedia Raphael Lemkin page ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin ). They are found on that page under "Working Life" and are the first two sentences of the second paragraph of that section. I should have deleted the reference numbers since they were from a different page. To clarify: source [2] on the Lemkin page is the same as source [9] at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide ). That source is  http://www.europaworld.org/issue40/raphaellemkin22601.htm 

Source [3] can be found on  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin in the end notes.  It is: William Korey "Raphael Lemkin: 'The Unofficial Man' ", Midstream June-July 1969

The statement of the relationship in Lemkin's thought between the Armenian Genocide and the Simele Massacres is more accurately expressed in the Lemkin article than in the Genocide article (under "Coining") The "Genocide" article will be improved by making it consistent with the Lemkin page. It's not clear what you mean in saying the current source doesn't support that strong a link to the Armenian Genocide. Is that source the present version of the article or something else? Thank you.  

[[User:Diranakir|Diranakir]] ([[User talk:Diranakir|talk]]) 16:05, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks for explaining. The Europeworld source says "In 1933 Dr Lemkin was deeply disturbed by the massacre of Christian Assyrians by Iraqis. His distress was compounded by earlier memories of the slaughter of Armenians by Turks during the First World War."  That wording expresses an equal or slightly less than equal relationship of the Armenian Genocide to the more recent attrocity. That is quite different from "...based on the Armenian Genocide and prompted ..." which suggests the more recent event merely reminded him of the previous event, upon which he then based his work. The current text seems to capture the Europaworld source better than your suggested text. I don't have a copy of your other reference. Could you copy the applicable portion here? Thanks, [[User:Celestra|Celestra]] ([[User talk:Celestra|talk]]) 21:32, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

To clarify: source [2] on the Lemkin page is the same as source [9] at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide ). That source is  http://www.europaworld.org/issue40/raphaellemkin22601.htm
Source [3] can be found on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin in the end notes. It is: William Korey "Raphael Lemkin: 'The Unofficial Man' ", Midstream June-July 1969.

Now to the central point: What is said about the Madrid conference and the Assyrians in the EuropaWorld piece is not presented as related to Lemkin's coining of the term genocide. It is a presentation of his state of mind at the time of the conference and writing his proposal. Therefore using the quote under the heading "Coining" is misleading. The Madrid conference was just one milestone on his way to coining the term in 1943.
Lemkin was acutely aware of the Armenian Genocide over a decade before 1933, and that was the beginning of his search for a legal concept to condemn and punish such a crime. In 1921 when he heard about the trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for assassinating Talat Pasha, the man primarily responsible for directing the Armenian Genocide. Lemkin asked his law professor why the Armenians did not have Talat arrested for the massacres. His professor replied that there was no law under which such an arrest could be made. Lemkin said that it was inconsistent that a man like Tehlirian could be put on trial for killing one man, but that his oppressor could not be charged for killing over a million people.
In 1949 in a nationally televised interview with American journalist Quincy Howe, Mr. Howe introduced Lemkin as the man who had created the word genocide.
He then asked Lemkin the background to his creation of the word. Lemkin said the following: "There were many genocides. First it happened to the Armenians, and then Hitler picked it up. . . ." 
In the light of this history (which I have presented from memory but am ready to source if you need) I don't see how it is tenable for you to maintain that the quote from EuropaWorld, taken out of context as it is, shows that the Assyrian massacres of 1933 had more to do with Lemkin's coining of the term than the Armenian Genocide. I think the lines from the Lemkin page which I have suggested as a substitute capture the reality of Lemkin's thinking much more truthfully.

Supplementary Material That Has A Bearing On The Issue:
It is very unclear what basis the EuropaWorld article has for giving such prominence in Lemkin's thinking to the Simele events at the time of the Madrid Conference. There is no author's name attached to the article, nor is any reference offered on this point.

Furthermore, it needs to be pointed out that source [3] on the Lemkin page [William Korey "Raphael Lemkin: 'The Unofficial Man' ", Midstream June-July 1969] does not contain a single reference to the Assyrians.
On the other hand the Armenians are mentioned very prominently on page 46 of the article as follows: ' In 1928 and until 1934, the brilliant young law professor [Lemkin] was appointed Prosecuting Attorney for Warsaw. . . . . Rekindled at this time were memories of the Armenian massacre. He began a detailed study of their depth and character which culminated in an episode which prefigured his U. N. struggle of 1946-48. Before a League of Nations-sponsored conference held in Madrid, Spain in 1933, the now prominent Warsaw public prosecutor proposed that the "destruction of national, religious, and racial groups" be declared "an international crime". . . . .'

I need some clarification regarding your response to my request for 3O. I may be overlooking something, but the provisional alternative wording you suggest does not seem to be addressed to the "Coining" heading, which is the section I'm calling into question. The crux of my objection is the following statement therein: "The concept of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, originated with the experience of the Assyrians[9] massacred in Iraq on 11 August 1933."

:Before seeing your question on my talk page, I rewrote the next–to–last sentence of my proposed language. (As you pointed out, it previously read, "In the report he portrayed genocide as a crime against international law which could be prosecuted in any nation where an offender was found, not just in the nation where the crime was committed.") Though I didn't rewrite it for that reason, I think the rewritten language — see above — may better address your issue about the material being included in the Coining section.

== Definition and article lacking mention of one group...? ==

I know there haven't been mass killings of LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered and Queer) people, aside from Hitler's killings. Still, the definition of Genocide at the top of the article should include the words "cultural group" and something about sexual orientation as well, to be inclusive. What else would systematic  mass killing of LGBTQ people be '''but''' genocide?

== Genocide disguised as crime ==

Example: Violent Crime in SA
 
I maintain that the violent crime in SA against whites is actively encouraged, endorsed, supported and perpetuated by the ANC terrorist regime as nothing less than retribution for apartheid. 

The senior ANC terrorists are as complicit in each and every atrocity committed against the white minority as their free-agents on the ground who are clearly perpetrating such atrocities on expressed or implied instruction from the ANC terrorist hierarchy as part of the broader, ongoing strategy of the genocide of whites which has been cunningly disguised by liberals as crime.

{{tn|editsemiprotected}}
<!-- Begin request -->
please review the article about Genocide and change "Christian population" to Armenian population, specifically.  Under "Coining of the term genocide", where it states: "...The concept originated in his youth when he first heard of the Ottoman government's mass killings of its Christian population during the First World War."  I would like you to review and specify that the "Christian population" in Ottoman government were [[Armenians]]. 
You can watch this video on Youtube ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCebMq-GmH4) where Dr. Raphael Lamkin himself states that he created the word genocide because of the Armenian killings by the Ottoman government. 
thank you

== importance of Lemkin quote ==

The third paragraph of the lead section is:

During a video interview with Raphael Lemkin, the interviewer asked him about how he came to be interested in this genocide. He replied; "Became intersted in genocide because it happened so many times. It happened to the Armenians, after Armenians Hitler took action".[7] [8]

I think it's out of place in the introduction, being a specific statement of the evolution of ideas of Raphael Lemkin. Due credit is given to him in the second paragraph (for coining the term and being an early opponent of genocidaires) but it seems to me that it's not encyclopedic to devote a whole lead paragraph about the general subject of genocide to the above quote.

So, per Ali55te's suggestion I'm raising the issue for discussion - should this quote stay or go?

P.S.
I originally removed the passage in question to the biographic article about Lemkin - from where it was struck out by another editor (Labattblueboy) who claimed that it gave superfluous information, given the extant Lemkin article. FYI.

== No precise definition, so why start with a bad one? ==

The definition used as the first sentence of the article is horribly flawed by use of "in part", and later on there is a lengthy discussion in the article about what in part means. 

Definitions should define things clearly, without need for lengthy discussions about what parts of the definition mean.

So, I'd recommend either dumping the first sentence of this article, and beginning with "no precise definition exists" or by using a better definition such as the one from Random House.

"the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group. "

Thoughts?

== Genocide causes ==

I don't have access to any academic journals right now, but surely someone, or some people, have posited causal conditions that lead to genocide? The reliance on Stanton throughout the article is troubling because none of the material comes from third-party sources. The Kakar sub-section  of 'Stages of genocide, influences leading to genocide, and efforts to prevent it' has acceptable references (although I would assume that citing a footnote is inferior to citing an original piece) but the entire rest of the section does not. The Stanton references are inappropriate due to the source (http://www.genocidewatch.org is not a reliable third-party source), and the rest of the sources have no page numbers. I understand the need to have the Stanton references, as they are the only social-scientific parts of the entire section, but it can only be legitimized via third-party sources - it is not enough that there is a website that proposes this.

An article needs to be made for the genocide operations commited by the Japanese military.  That's not something that should be looked over given how the atrocities played out.  Not that one should judge them in an emotional factor, but still.  It's worth referancing.   

I think this article should include a new article of some of the mass killings Japan commited during the war.

== The fight against islamistic terrorism, an actual genocide? ==

Most of them, that will read this text come from USA or other western countries. I think that the first reaction will be a declination, but i hope that you try to think about this thought, even if you have another opinion.

I think that some parts of genocide still fits to the war against the islamic terrorism:
* Stage 1. The people were divided into us (usa, western world, the good one) and them (the Islamics, Terrorists, Arabic).
* Stage 2. There was much hate speech (especially at the beginning).
* Stage 3. Guantanamo (People treated as animals). Or do you remember the soldier that "fucked" a skull of an dead "terrorist"?
* Stage 4. The greatest reason for the war was the fight against islamic terrorism and soldiers got trained to kill them.
* Stage 5. Propaganda from politicians and media...
* Stage 6. People that looked like islamic or arabic people were threated different by officers, at airports, by other people, ...
* Stage 7. When will the war stop? When all are exterminated?
* Stage 8. USA or the western world will never say that they did a genocide (and much people that will read this, too).

In my opinion this should be mentioned, especially because its actual! How do you think about it?

:::not sure who wrote the above, but in reply:  it is not appropriate to call the west's actions ''genocide'' in this case since it does not aim to wipe out the entire muslim people --as a whole.  arguably some of the west's actions were ''awful'', but ''genocide'' has the additional extra element of: trying to kill off a whole race or other group.   to be fair, it might be worth recalling that the west actually tried with military means and other methods to stop an '''actual''' attempted regional genocide against muslims: the ethnic cleansing being done to the bosnian muslims in the 1990s.  sometimes the USA et al put their lives on the line to protect followers of islam.  sometimes. cheers.

::::::I wrote it and it is just a thought. But Wikipedia says this: Genocide is defined as "the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or '''in part''', of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group..." So you have to be wrong in saying, that the intention to kill all of this group is necessary for a genocide, or the Wikipedia is wrong.

No, the "in part" was added just to make it clear that even if a group kills another group, but misses one person, the act can still be classified as genocide. Otherwise a group killing off another group will not be classified with genocide because they did not kill all of them. If the "in part" did not exist, then the entire group would have to be killed before the UN could respond and classify that as genocide. Otherwise it would be a crime against humanity, for which the punishment or the charges are not nearly as bad.

Why is the image of a concentration camp used to represent genocide? It says in its caption "It was not a killing zone" so it is actually proving my point. Maybe for a labor camp, a slave camp, article but it is not representative of "genocide." Far more representative pictures are available.

Another school of thought on genocide has come from the black intellectual tradition, mostly in the United States. In 1951 William Patterson, acting as National Executive Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress, along with a delegation of fellow activists, went to the United Nations secretary general to charge the United States government with genocide. With ''We Charge Genocide:  The Historic Petition to the United Nations for Relief from a Crime of the United States Government Against the Negro People,'' Patterson and his delegation took full advantage of the new human rights discourses being produced in the wake of World War II and the Holocaust to seek remedy for centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, lynching, and the pre-mature deaths of millions of black Americans.<ref>Vargas, João H. Costa. ''Never Meant to Survive:  Genocide and Utopias in Black Diaspora Communities.'' (Lanham, MD:  Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2008). xx.</ref> 

In his 2008 book, ''Never Meant to Survive:  Genocide and Utopias in Black Diaspora Communities'', Anthropologist João H. Costas Vargas argues decades later that, according to the UN definition of genocide, the term must still be used to describe anti-black racism in the United States. With the destruction of black bodies, culture, and reproduction as the modern nation-state's imperative, Vargas argues, "the degrees of infrahumanity according to which Black communities exist and against which they resist only attest to the continuity of modernity's genocidal impetus." <ref>Vargas, João H. Costa. ''Never Meant to Survive:  Genocide and Utopias in Black Diaspora Communities.'' (Lanham, MD:  Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2008). xx.</ref> 

Michelle Alexander's groundbreaking study of race in the criminal justice system in the United States, ''The New Jim Crow:  Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'', suggests the usefulness of the term genocide to describe the mass incarceration of black and brown people in the United States since the end of the Jim Crow era. Arguing that the War on Drugs has stripped the citizenship rights of more black Americans than slavery itself, Alexander defines genocide both as cultural destruction but reconsiders death in the context of the loss of citizenship rather than merely the ending of a life.<ref>Alexander, Michelle. ''The New Jim Crow:  Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness''. (New York:  The New Press, 2010). 6, 206. </ref> While the charge of genocide against black America has not been picked up by mainstream legal and international human rights discourses, a burgeoning group of scholars and activists are applying the phrase to slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration, and urban poverty, and calling attention to the racialization of pre-mature death in the United States and abroad.

== Countervalue nuclear strikes ==

To what extent would [[countervalue]] nuclear strikes constitute genocide? To date, there have been only [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two nuclear strikes against a wartime enemy]], both against cities, and both of which killed tens of thousands of people. As defined in the opening parts of the genocide article, a genocide is ""the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group". Countervalue nuclear strikes are those which "target an opponent's cities and civilian populations". Would that not result in the effective "deliberate and systematic (partial) destruction of a ... group", if the targets had plenty of people living in them? Shouldn't countervalue nuclear strikes be considered at least attempted genocide? [[Special:Contributions/192.12.88.62|192.12.88.62]] ([[User talk:192.12.88.62|talk]]) 05:04, 27 October 2012 (UTC)
:As an American, this makes me feel uncomfortable, because, taking this to its logical conclusion, it is evident that [[Harry S Truman]] authorized genocide against Japanese civilians in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He could've demonstrated the bombs away from the Japanese population, but he didn't do that. Our military deliberately targeted the cities, and the Trinity test had already occurred at this point, so the military probably knew that this bomb would create a deadly and massive explosion. Furthermore, the deliberate targeting of Japanese cities is evidence of a systematic effort, as the US military was already targeting Japanese cities for air raids at this time. Expanding this logic even further, it is also evident that the bombings of London (by the Nazis), Dresden (by the Americans), Berlin (by the Allies), and St. Petersburg (aka Leningrad) (by the Nazis) also constitute genocide, and so do the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks.

== Is the US trade embargo against Cuba genocide? ==
In Cuba (particularly gov't officials) say that the US trade embargo against Cuba is a form of genocide as per Section C of Article 2 of the 1948 Genocide Convention (deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part), quoting a State Department memo regarding the stated purpose of the embargo that is dated April 6, 1960 (see http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d499 for full text): "If the above are accepted or cannot be successfully countered, it follows that every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba. If such a policy is adopted, it should be the result of a positive decision which would call forth a line of action which, while as adroit and inconspicuous as possible, makes the greatest inroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government." The purpose of the trade embargo outlined in the memo (to incite a popular uprising against the Cuban gov't by bringing hunger and disease to the Cuban populace) may sound somewhat inhuman, immoral, and unethical by today's standards, but the US seems to be aware of the fact that using hunger and disease to bring democracy to Cuba so as to coerce Cubans to accept multiparty democracy is not only inhuman, it also violates the right of peoples to self-determination. For example, the vast majority of patients in Cuba who are suffering cancer and other health problems and have to undergo unnecessary surgery because of prohibitions on the sale of US-made medical equipment to Cuba appear to be closer to death, only to have well-experienced Cuban doctors save the patients from death the last minute using medical tools either made in Cuba or Europe. Therefore, it would be cynical for embargo critics to label the embargo as "genocidal". Barack Obama could at least inform the Cuban government that the embargo is not genocide by reminding the State Department's top officials that the purpose of the trade embargo as stated in the 1960 memo doesn't conform to modern ethical standards because embargoes are not meant to coerce peoples to accept US-style democracy by bringing hunger and disease. The Cuban government is just making fun of the current nature of the embargo when discussing the embargo's stated purpose in the 1960 memo.

== Another one? ==

Hi!: a remarkable question in dealing with genocides may be how far, or how early the concept could or should be applied:
1 Samuel 15:3->    
Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.   
The Amalek article in Wikipedia records the sentence from a Rabbin of Germans and Armenians being: 'Amalek', on the occasion of the Kaiser visiting the Holy Lands. A XXI century politician, in a nation placed East to Zyon, wears the surname: 'Malek'. 'Malek' sounds close to: 'Moloch', may: 'Amalek', be: 'Ab-Malek', the Moloch's men or tribe?

== Raphael Lemkin's Connection to Coining the Term Genocide ==

The section discussing Raphael Lemkin's connection to the coining of the term could elaborate on his conception of the idea.

This definition further explains the concept and breaks away from traditional ideologies of a simple mass killing of a specific group.

== Soviet POWs ==

I spotted a recent edit and it raised a question for me -- was the fate of Soviet POWs in WWII a genocide?

Here are a few sources:

* Cannot see if the author terms it genocide, but it's included in the context -- Doris L. Bergen: ''War and Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust'' (Google book 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=INbnwj_AQVIC&pg=PA163&dq=soviet+POW+genocide&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQoqne5-TKAhUEQyYKHWqaDaAQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=soviet%20POW%20genocide&f=false preview])

* Hitler's Forgotten '''Genocides''': The Fate of Soviet POWs by Thomas Earl Porter: [http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/law/law_review/issues/elon_law_review_v5_no2_porter.pdf pdf online] 

* [http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/center-study-genocide-conflict-resolution-and-human-rights/soviet-pows-eastern-front-1941-1942 Soviet POWs on the Eastern Front, 1941-1942] -- This appears to be a research project / a course. From online description: "The Nazi leadership cadre planned for genocide against the Soviet Red Army well before the invasion"; "All in all, the Nazi genocide against Soviet POWs remains one of the greatest crimes perpetrated in the history of humanity." Cited in references: "Berkhoff, Karel C. “The “Russian” Prisoners of War in Nazi-Ruled Ukraine as Victims of '''Genocidal''' Massacre,” Holocaust Genocide Studies 15, no. 1 (2001): 1-32.

So it looks to me that at least some in the research community is beginning to look at the treatment of Soviet POWs as a genocide. Any feedback on this? [[User:K.e.coffman|K.e.coffman]] ([[User talk:K.e.coffman|talk]]) 04:47, 7 February 2016 (UTC)

== Guenther Lewy reference ==

Sorry, I should have explained better my revert.  Guenter Lewy is renowned scholar and academic who has specialized, inter alia, in history related to genocide.  Some of his views are controversial and some people (myself included) feel that he has taken a rather narrow view of the term genocide.  But the crude label “genocide denier” does not really apply. But for more than twenty years he has published widely on the issue in scholarly journals as well as other peer reviewed publications, examining carefully the definition of genocide as it is applies to mass murders.  It is not surprising that there is some disagreement about his conclusions.  This book brings together many of the articles he has written on the subject and is useful for most discussions relating to genocides and other mass murders.  It is published by a university press which is why I previously used the term peer-reviewed. --[[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 01:24, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

In this edit sourced content was reverted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genocide&type=revision&diff=757923473&oldid=757915207] and a personal attack was done in the edit summary. The edits I did were not just as claimed by the user critical of Kurds, but also of Turks, Ottomans and Iraqi Army and Palestinians. What is commmon in the edits is that they were pro-Christian and pro-Assyrian, not that they were anti-Ottoman or anti-Kurdish. 
What was added is based upon reliable sources and found in other words in articles like [[Assyrian Genocide]] and [[Armenian genocide]].
Can I ask the user who reverted to give a policy based reason for the revert, and other users to comment? Thanks.

Also, the user is wrong that it is irrelevant, or it is opinion, but many historians have argued that kurdish-Assyrian animosity dating back decades or even longer have played a major role in such events. He cannot say that this irrelevant. See for example the section "The Kurds responsibility for the massacre" in Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. And the British knew well of the generals anti-assyrian animosity, as do the Assyrians.

Can the image be added without mentioning that the general was Kurdish or that the army was Iraqi?

== Problems with the introductory and UN definitions ==

Unless I've been missing something, historical campaigns of genocide clearly target political and social groups, such as the Left, communists, socialists and trades unionists (the latter being potentially apolitical and therefore social). In Cambodia and China professionals were targeted, another social group. Groups have also clearly been subject to genocide because of their sexual inclinations.
This is touched upon in the current definitions by the phrase 'or in part' (with reference to the genocide of peoples) but no overt mention of genocide of political and social groups is made, despite its clear historical importance. This seems in line with traditional conservative prohibition on discussion of sex, religion and politics(!), on the grounds that such discussions can become inflammatory. But religious groups are overtly mentioned, and there is no consistent ban on these topics elsewhere in Wikipedia guidelines or indeed UN literature.
Why does it matter to me suddenly now? Because I have suddenly become consciously aware of the possibility of historical trend towards genocide towards myself and my own political and social groups in my own life/lifetime. I have suddenly become aware of this in the course of preparing a legal case, and suddenly feel let down and disappointed to find that standard definitions of genocide fail to overtly record its clear politico-social aspect. This makes the claim to be a possible victim of genocide sound potentially less plausible in a court of law. But realistically, it shouldn't do, should it, and I and others like myself shouldn't suffer because of UN or Wikipedian squeamishness - Amen?
Traditionally, the victim groups I refer to have perhaps done less than our share, overtly, in our group identity role, in terms of reversing trends towards genocide - this was, in my case at least, linked to not knowing what to do or say or when. But let's hope this initial Talk section post marks a break in that trend.--[[Special:Contributions/5.150.92.174|5.150.92.174]] ([[User talk:5.150.92.174|talk]]) 16:57, 14 March 2017 (UTC)

===Nuremberg is key ===

With regard to the recent debate here regarding competing definitions of genocide, Count 3 of the indictment of the 24 Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg Trials seems sufficiently inclusive to shed some light on the matter: 'They (the defendants) conducted deliberate and systematic genocide—viz., the extermination of racial and national groups—against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people, and national, racial or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, Gypsies and others.' In other words, yes it's racial, yes it's religious, but yes it's quite clearly social as well - 'classes of people' - even in the minds of the Allied lawyers of 1945, when the word 'genocide' was only two years old. Also, it's important to consider how the word 'national' varies in meaning between normal peacetime and a time of immediate post-war occupation. The Allies are occupying whole nations at the time of this legal definition, and mulling judgment over the treatment of whole nations over which they have assumed jurisdiction. Thus a 'national group' means 'any group in that nation.' As time goes on, Allied occupation ends, but the same legal terminology is, confusingly, retained, wrongly suggesting nations rather than groups within a nation.--[[Special:Contributions/5.150.92.174|5.150.92.174]] ([[User talk:5.150.92.174|talk]]) 16:34, 17 March 2017 (UTC)

:::Thankyou for the addition, I don't think it was ''strictly'' necessary, but it does no harm. What we cannot do is extrapolate from a few words in one use at Nuremberg, a general principle, ie that the term ''ordinarily'', or ''legally'' encompasses 'classes of people' defined by something other than race/ethnicity.

::::We don't need to 'extrapolate from a few words in one use at Nuremberg,' we can simply acquire a basic education re the trial and the events leading to it.

==Revert to group==
Even though it seems rather petty, I reverted because it is not really a question of English usage, but after much debate, the Convention was drawn up not to protect people in general, but people as members of a selected list of groups. See Power (2003), p. 57. [[User:Joel Mc|Joel Mc]] ([[User talk:Joel Mc|talk]]) 15:53, 16 March 2017 (UTC)

:''A'' people does not mean "people in general', it means a 'nation' or other distinct racial/ethnic group. Saying "a group of people (usually defined as a .....  group)" Is clumsy and unnecessary, also it is the intention to destroy ''the'' group, rather than ''a'' group of the group that characterises genocide, death of ''a'' people, rather than death of ''many'' people.

::Reading Lemkin as well as looking at the debates in the GA, it is clear that the focus was on protecting groups, not “a people” which is why the convention make explicit mention of which groups of people.  Not for example political groups or parties.  This can be seen in Power’s discussion, and even more clearly in Philippe Sands discussion of Lemkin and Lauterpact.[Sands, Philippe (2016)] The Convention of course does not mention “a people” But the issue is not worth spending more time on even if it is a little misleading.

::''"A people"'', always means a national or ethnic group, ''"a group of people"'' doesn't. [[User:Pincrete|Pincrete]] ([[User talk:Pincrete|talk]]) 20:35, 16 March 2017 (UTC)

:::The problem is that “a group” doesn’t always mean “a people”.  For  example a religious group which is protected by the Convention, i.e. Baha'is or Jehovah's Witnesses are groups that governments tried to eliminate and were protected by the Convention, But neither can be designated as “a people”. Perhaps it would be better to drop the word "people" altogether and use the more comprehensive definition which is in the Convention.

:::::To the best of my knowledge, the persecution of 'Jehovah's Witnesses' has never been described as 'genocide', I did a quick search and this view was confirmed, although they ''(and the mentally or physically ill, political opponents, gays etc)''  are sometimes included in the broader definition of the [[Holocaust]].

::::::I agree, partly I suspect because the term genocide and the convention comes later.
