Those working on this article might want to look at [[Jim Hightower]]'s very interesting article "Bush Zones Go National" in ''[[The Nation]]'' (August 16/23, 2004). It's a partisan piece, of course, but it looks rather well researched. -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] 19:37, Aug 22, 2004 (UTC)

==Disambiguation is Needed==

Freedom of Assembly is a Constitutional Right recognized in the Bill of Rights.

== Freedom: assembly vs. association ==

I am not a lawyer, and I am suspicious whether [[Freedom of assembly]] and [[Freedom of association]] are one and the same thing. If they are, then the articles must be merged. If they are not, the distinction must be clarified somewhere for ignoramuses like me. [[User:Mikkalai|Mikkalai]] 19:38, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I'm no expert either, but I've always associated freedom of assembly with the right to gather physically in one place and freedom of association with the right to communicate and to organize into groups. Yes, it would be good to get an expert to sort this out, because that's not what our articles now say. -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]]|[[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 20:27, Oct 13, 2004 (UTC)

::This is a very late reply, but for the record freedom of assembly and freedom of association are very different concepts. The first is about the right of people to get together in the same place, the second is about membership in organizations. --[[User:PullUpYourSocks|PullUpYourSocks]] 14:31, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

I have tried to make the difference more clear. The truth is that different national jurisdictions and to some extent human rights instruments have or are understood to have a different interpretation of freedom of assembly and freedom of association. Hope what i have done makes sense. there is also a fluent line between freedom of assembly and the right to protest (see wikiarticle).

== I'm not sure what this means  ==

"Freedom of assembly is a key right in democratic countries, as it allows its citizens to form or join any political party, special interest group, or union, without any government restrictions."

There are a lot of assumptions built into this statement, especially with the implied distinction between "key" rights and not-so-key rights. What would be an example of a non-key right? that would still BE a right, rather than a privilege etc.? --[[User:Christofurio|Christofurio]] 00:04, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)

==Tiered rights==
This tiered rights section is incredibly confusing. It should at least refer to what country is it talking about. --[[User:PullUpYourSocks|PullUpYourSocks]] 14:34, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

== The Groups of a State, Country, or Nation ==

To answer the top three statements made above,
I shall type each one out in short say.

The Freedom of Assembly is a gathering or large
meeting where people of the common day or everyday 
join together to talk of ideas or plans for the
future.

The Freedom of Association is a banquet where people
of both civil and military matter come to together.
A place where people association and get to know
each other to see if their operations can be joined
together.

Now the actually meaning of the Freedom of Assembly
means the somethin similiar, I believe, to a protest
when the people of a state, country, or nation feel
as if they are not being heard. The only time this
freedom is performed is when the people feel as if
their own government is not doing their job or if
their leader is not doing as he/she promised.

More or less, the Freedom of Assembly or of Association
means two different things in a way, but they are
both similiar when it involves members of union or
political party that has its concerns for the future
of its own estate. (I hope that sums up the statements.)

== Removed link ==

The link "[http://www.iww.org/en/culture/articles/zinn13.shtml Repression Against the IWW] in the United States" was removed as "irrelevant". I'm not sure it's quite sufficiently focused on this topic to belong here, but it is certainly at least moderately relevant: it is largely about an situation in which the U.S. failed to grant freedom of assembly, essentially banning gatherings because of who was gathering. - [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 00:04, 2 August 2006 (UTC)poop

freedom of assembly should be okay but its not to some people  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.151.179.162|70.151.179.162]] ([[User talk:70.151.179.162|talk]]) 18:42, 27 August 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Right of Assembly no longer applies?  Really??! ==

The article now ends " Due to the recent signing of the anti-protest trespass bill, the right to assemble no longer applies".  

I wouldn't be surprised if this is buried in some legislation or a somewhat accurate statement as a practical matter (e.g., free speech protest areas at national conventions, limitations on Zuccotti Park protests mentioned in New York Times on 3/20/12), but is there really an "anti-protest trespass bill" that negates the First Amendment Constitutional right?  

Shouldn't there be a link or citation if there is.  

This sounds like hyperbole or sarcasm.

== Should an Occupy poster be a main illustration? ==

I'm not an expert on Wikipedia policy, but it strikes me that the image of an "Occupy" poster might violate NPOV. This wouldn't be an issue, except freedom of assembly as it relates to the Occupy movement is a somewhat controversial topic (which is not the case for generic strike protests, the subject of the other image on this page). Because it is controversial, it seems inappropriate it be included as only a caption. I believe it should either be addressed ''in the text'' with a neutral examination of the issue (if it is deemed significant enough), or otherwise the image should be removed. As it is, it gives the impression someone is trying to "sneak" it in. Personally, I'd argue for the latter approach. I contend that any appearance here has undue weight given the short length of this page, the international context of this page, and the fact that the Occupy movement was a short-lived, contemporary event relative to the inveterate nature of this freedom. Perhaps it would be better addressed (again, with text) in the main article on the First Amendment.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/152.7.224.4|152.7.224.4]] ([[User talk:152.7.224.4|talk]]) 04:57, 16 August 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
