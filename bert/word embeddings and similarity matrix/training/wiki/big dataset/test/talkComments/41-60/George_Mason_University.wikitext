==Notable Faculty==
[http://www.gmu.edu/robinson/faculty.htm] All of these professors should be included as notable faculty. Some are already there. Trefil and Hazen for example are regarded very highly in their respective fields. If you noticed, Trefil already has his own wikipedia page, thus showing that he is a recognized person.

==GMU Police==
Another prominent aspect of GMU is the seemingly ubiquitous presence of the GMU Police.. there is a ratio of approximately 1 officer per 135 resident students. [[User:Thc420|Thc420]] 05:22, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Thats common of all universities. [[User:Agriculture|Agriculture]] 05:43, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Final Four==
I am deleteing the sentence "In what is regarded as the greatest upset in NCAA history"... it happend all of three hours from the time that I am writing this, there is absolutley no way someone can objectively make that statement. It's a great accomplishment, but to make that claim only hours after the accomplishment its ridiculous.

==Mid Majors in Final Four==

There was a statement that said they were the first mid-major since 1979 to be in the Final 4, when Penn made it as a #9 seed. This is not true, there have been a handful of "mid-majors" (or for argument's sake, teams not from one of the 6 BCS conferences) to have made the Final 4 since 1979, they were just all #1 seeds so it wasn't such a surprise that they did it. Indiana St. did it as a #1 (also in 1979), so did UNLV in 1990/91, as did UMass in 1996. There are others but I'm pretty sure they are in BCS conferences now if they weren't at the time of their Final Four appearance. I changed it to "the first team from a mid-major conference that was not seeded #1 to reach the Final Four since 1979, when Penn reached as a #9 seed."

== GMU Presidents Past and Present ==

Under the Presidents Past and Present section, "George W. Johnson, (1978-1996)" links to a page on George Washington Johnson, an African-American singer and song recording artist who died in 1914.  The correct "George W. Johnson" is George William (not Washington) Johnson, who was born in 1928.

== University Housing ==
The current copy says that student housing for 700 students opened in 1986. This is incorrect. I started at GMU in 1981 and the student apartments were already open. In the fall of 1982 I moved into the 2nd dorm building when it opened (Dominion Hall, Commonweath Hall had already opened).

== Upper level academic programs ==

I added a small section about the Honors Program in Gen. Ed. and the University Scholars program because I feel that in the coming years they will become more and more well known.  It is also useful for those using Wikipedia for admissions info.

== "Slaveowner" ==
It was suggested that I bring this to the talk page, so I will. 

The repeated addition of "slaveowner" and removal of more relevant information, like the fact that George Mason authored the document that the Bill of Rights was based on, is not appropriate for this article. The topic of this article is the university, not whether the namesake owned slaves, which is entirely irrelevant to why the school is named for him, and not anywhere near one of the most notable things about him. Per WP:LEAD, the lead should summarize the body, and the body is, again, about the university. This needs to be corrected.

==Student Government==

I removed the section on Student Government as it dealt mainly with interaction regarding one specific student. If Student Government sections are common to University articles on Wikipedia, I propose limiting the section in this article strictly to the structure of student government as a compromise.

== Largest university? ==

The opening segment states that GMU is the largest public university in the Commonwealth of Virginia with an enrollment of over 29,000; however, the Virginia Commonwealth University article states that it is the largest with an enrollment of over 31,000.  Could somebody please look into this?  Thanks.
[[User:Dcteas17|Daniel]] 23:15, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

I just checked the Collegeboard.com profiles for GMU and VCU, which states the enrollment of the two schools as 28,242 an 25,961, respectively. Consulting the two schools' websites, GMU stated 29,728, while I could only find "more than 29,000" students for VCU. So, I think that unless someone digs up the hard numbers for VCU (which I'm too lazy to do), the article should stay as it is.[[User:Bloodsorr0w|Preston]] 08:00, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

:GMU enrollment figures can be found here [http://www.gmu.edu/vcenter/masonfacts/].  This is a true total, including graduates and the law school.  A comparable enrollment total for VCU can be found in this pdf file [http://www.vcu.edu/ireweb/student/studemo05.pdf], via this webpage [http://www.vcu.edu/ireweb/factbook.html]. Based on these sources, the totals come to:
::*GMU has 29,728 for 2005-2006
::*VCU has 29,349 for 2005-2006

:GMU is larger by a handful. It could easily change. -- [[User:Vector4F|Vector4F]] 21:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

== Need to consolidate athletics info ==

It's at the top of the article and in the article below under the "Athletics" header.  I'm too tired to work on this right now, but thought it was worth pointing out.

==Alumni Section==
Should Karl Rove and Anna Escobedo Cabral be listed in the alumni section?
I think they should be taken out of the article. 

*Perhaps they should be listed as notable former students? [[User:Hiberniantears|Hiberniantears]] 13:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

* I'd rather have the list indicate some are former students. Alumni means you graduated. It should still be noted that Rove attended, though. --[[User:Skynet|Skynet]] 21:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

** An alumnus, according to the dictionary definition is "(in Latin a masculine noun) [which] refers to a male graduate or former student. (From wikipedia, of course). Technically, by this definition, a former student is also an alumnus.

== Unnecessary Information ==
I think there are some unnecessary information that are presented in the article.
1) Admission section is unnecessary and should be taken out since wikipedia article is not a promotional material for potential students. 
2) There should be some standard for putting names in the famous alumni section. Meteorologist for the local television station is a hardly notable and need to identify who has graduated from GMU and only attended classes at GMU. The section is titled as Notable Alumni and former students but most university wikipedia articles do not have a section for former students and I think it should just include students who have graduated from the university.([[User:68.98.148.173|68.98.148.173]] 02:11, 13 May 2006 (UTC))

* Shouldn't it be noted that Karl Rove attended? How would you include this information? --[[User:Skynet|Skynet]] 22:08, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
* I added admissions for a class profile, which how I listed it was more practical information on the process, but it has since been cleaned up to be a class profile, which it is better suited for.

== Condense Campus Information ==
Should Each campus have its own page with information on separate points of interest (particularly Fairfax), to remove some clutter and condense the information?

* Do any of the other universities use this type of format? --[[User:Skynet|Skynet]] 00:29, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

== Krasnow "Nobel" claim ==
One assumes they are referring to economists Buchanan and V. Smith, but I don't believe either of them is actually affiliated with Krasnow.  Having attended one conference there doesn't equate to housing them.  Buchanan works in Buchanan House, though he is soon to retire, while Vernon Smith's office is on the Arlington campus.  I am thus striking the Nobel claim from the picture caption.  [[User:Jjb|Jjb]] 06:19, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==University logo==
I originally came to this talk page to alert the editors that I was going to tag the seal at the top of the infobox as having no fair use rationale.  However, as I did a little research, I found that it's not GMU's ''official'' logo; the one at the bottom of the infobox is. See [http://logo.gmu.edu/webguide/ here] and [http://logo.gmu.edu/index.html#seal here] for what I'm talking about. Given that the university has very clear standards for what constitutes proper usage of its logos, I'd wager that the only way you could properly claim fair use is to use that official logo to represent GMU. With that in mind, I [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] uploaded an [[:Image:GMU logo.svg|SVG version of the bottom logo]] and moved it to the top of the infbox. Obviously if you (the regular editors) feel differently, you can change it back.  However, I do think you'll have a hard time justifying it as fair use. Cheers!

== Disputed language on rankings ==
OK, I have been reverting for the past few months edits by [[User:Gmu1987]] that continuously reinsert the redundant, and unnecessarily degrading content here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Mason_University&diff=167754624&oldid=167653307]. Yes, the information is sourced, and in some respects is true, but the spirit of it seems geared only to emphasize the school is ordinary; the SI quote in particular is out of context, and seems only mean-spirited. Personally, I believe this is a case of [[Wikipedia:Tendentious editing|tendentious editing]]. The fact that Gmu1987 is a single purpose account, which only makes this contribution, but is on Wikipedia pretty much every day to revert its removal seems to indicate a high probability of a sockpuppet as well. Likewise, Gmu1987 has been hostile in edit summaries to myself and other editors, and has ignored my offer to discuss the issue on his, or this talk page. Before making any further issue out of this, I just want to get a sense from any of the other contributors to this page (or any other established editors) on whether or not their is any type of consensus to remove this material. If not, I will let it drop. [[User:Hiberniantears|Hiberniantears]] 19:28, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

:There is no need for 2 articles in the article lead that make the same point (i.e. lack of name recognition).  Furthermore, the second article, the one in question, is written in a belittling tone towards to GMU and totally inappropriate to be in the lead.  This addition was originally posted by someone who is a heavy contributor of the JMU page (who has made it a point to compare JMU to the level of UVA and W&M with very weak and inappropriate sources), and I can only assume part of the reason he decided to post this particular article is because it compares JMU to the level of GWU, which is very debatable.  This is a page about GMU, not about which founding father is better known. If you want to list problems, don’t do it in the lead and get a more appropriate source than a sports writer.

:I actually agree with [[User:Bvjrm|Bvjrm]]'s action. Gmu1987 strikes me as a sock of 72.196.220.97, and the fact that Gmu1987 has only made edits to this article, as noted above, is a pretty obvious instance of sockpuppetry. I noticed that someone removed this content earlier today editing as 208.4.46.187, which appears to be located in Reston, VA. Given the nature of how this content came to be in the article in the first place, I would urge everyone to remain logged in with their real user names.

GMU's economics program is not well-known because it's particularly strong (Louisiana State or Alabama are equally "strong" in economics) but because of the department's ideological focus on the free market.

Interesting how users keep pretending that it's the alumni section they want to include, and yet they continue to revert all of my edits to this page. I also like how no one has made any effort to actually source the section. Other university articles have notable alumni sections because they ''actually have'' notable alumni. Mason doesnt. As for mentioning Mason-the-man in the history section, that content is already mentioned in the introduction... but no, keep re-adding the same sentence in the history section.

== Koch family influence ==

I am surprised that this article doesn't include any discussion of the GMU's relationship with the Koch brothers and the broader political, economic, and legal movements associated with them. I found many article that suggest that this is noteworthy topic: [https://apnews.com/613470e79eb64a5f9a4880996e0fd7c5 AP article], [https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/spreading-the-free-market-gospel/413239/ Atlantic Monthly article], [http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/students-take-gmu-to-court-over-koch-brothers-million-in/article_93778250-ba6f-11e7-9fcf-3b19f2a5cac0.html Fairfax Times article]. The AP article starts with "George Mason University, a public school outside the nation’s capital, has quietly become a conservative powerhouse in economics and law, a reputation built in part with tens of millions of dollars a year from billionaire Republican donor Charles Koch." The separate article on the [[Mercatus Center]] discusses the Koch brothers, but I couldn't find anything in the article that reflects this information, nor anything in the history or the talk page that suggests that it has been addressed at some point. Before I wade into a hornet's nest, I thought I would find out whether I'm missing something. [[User:Rks13|Rks13]] ([[User talk:Rks13|talk]]) 17:52, 20 March 2018 (UTC)
