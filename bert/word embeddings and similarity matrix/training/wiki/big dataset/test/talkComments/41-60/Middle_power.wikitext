==Advanced Power==
I think there should be a new category, one for those major middle powers that are obviously stronger than their counterparts but weaker then a great power which would be called an "Advanced Power" which is just in between the two. I think countries such as Brazil, Canada, Australia, India, Germany, Japan, and other major countries of that range should be included into this new category of "Advanced Power".--[[User:Collingwood26|Collingwood26]] ([[User talk:Collingwood26|talk]]) 10:07, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

I agree with you.Australia,Brazil,Canada,Germany,India,Italy,Japan and Spain are MAIN middle powers that can't be compared to the other ones.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.7.192|151.40.7.192]] ([[User talk:151.40.7.192|talk]]) 08:22, 21 September 2013 (UTC)

==Edit request, 10 October 2013==

In the articles "Middle power" there's a lot of confusion and even in "Great power " article too.Collingwood26 is right purposing that thing about "main,medium and small" middle powers.(even if it isn't sufficient).
They are low level articles considering how they set some countries like UK,France,Russia Japan,Germany,Italy and Canada.They are really dubious about criteria used.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.13.136|151.40.13.136]] ([[User talk:151.40.13.136|talk]]) 10:48, 10 October 2013 (UTC)

The list of middle power must be changed .First of all countries must be divided in main,medium and small middle powers.
Second in article people talk like if it were a middle power and it' is just in comics.
Third it's unclear the line that divides a great power like Japan or Germany from countries like Italy.Really  2 level low articles "Middle power" and " Great power".Italy and India should be 2 great powers.Anyway ignorance rules.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.0.150|151.40.0.150]] ([[User talk:151.40.0.150|talk]]) 11:54, 11 October 2013 (UTC)

The famous sources you cite in this article and "Great power" article are just bla bla bla of SOME academics and not the of the opinion of the main academics and of the common sense in the world.An italian like an indian  or somebody else reading this article laugh.India and Italy are copmpared to small countries.There's an abyss between them and the other as military and economy and demography.Watch [[Italy ]] and [[ India ]] articles,they are the best citations.Are they less than Japan or Germany or France or UK or Russia? Really difficult to realize watching data.Impossible to realize.Even [[ Brazil ]] or [[ Canada ]] can't be common middle powers. They are even compared to middle powers the are of another size.People are laughing (above all in India and Italy) of these articles.We discover that Norway or Thailand or Ukraine have the same importance of  states like India,Italy ,Brazil and Canada.))))))[[Special:Contributions/151.40.0.150|151.40.0.150]] ([[User talk:151.40.0.150|talk]]) 20:09, 11 October 2013 (UTC)

[[ India ]] has the 10th largest economy as nominal GDP , a large demography ,a large territory and a developed military system .India owns its own nuclear arsenal.It's member of the G20.[[ Italy ]] has the 9th world economy as GDP ,it has the 3rd largest golden reserve  in the world,it is part of nuclear sharing programs (and even developed its own centres like CAMEN to produce nuke in 1968),it has the 6th net national wealth (5th as developed country) in the world (much better than Russia that is really poor and better  UK and very very close to France and Germany ) and for this is member of the G7.It is member also of the G8 and G20 or whatelse.
Brazil has the 7th largest nominal GDP in the world and an importantant national net wealth.It's member of the G20.Canada has the 10th economy in the world as GDP and the 8th as national net wealth (7th as developed country).It is member of the G7.It is member of the G8 and G20 too.
How can article compare these states to the other ones (Norway,Thailand and so on....) ? It's really difficult to realize the difference with the states cited in "Great power" (so called).Try to better these 2 articles that make laugh millions people,it's normal in the common sense and in the people that studied at a very good level.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.0.150|151.40.0.150]] ([[User talk:151.40.0.150|talk]]) 08:30, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

:@151.40.... we are not here to document our own value judgements about various countries. Nobody cares which countries you or I or any other Wikipedia editor thinks greater or lesser powers than any other, whatever reasons you put forward. It is a question of what the sources say. Identify some good sources, and we can reflect them. Fail to identify good sources, and we aren't going to reflect your views just because you tell us to. Simple as that. --[[User:Stfg|Stfg]] ([[User talk:Stfg|talk]]) 09:58, 12 October 2013 (UTC)


Simpler is using Wikipedia articles  like [[ India ]], [[ Brazil ]] , [[ Italy ]] and [[ Canada ]].Citations in these articles are already set (and many times a simple citation hides a lie) and are more than sufficient to declare that these states can't be "normal" middle powers (they can't be compared to Norway or Ukraine or so on).This article that is linked to " Great power " concept isn't at all clear like the same " Great power ".They are dubious articles .The articles referred to the single states are more certain citations.If people deny articles on these states it's like if people deny Wikipedia articles.So people don't need citations,but just taking descriptions from the articles of these states.
There are huge contrasts between these states descriptions and their rankings in Wikipedia articles  "Great power " and "Middle power". (luckily in the reality they are really great powers).And people last to laugh.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.64.80|151.40.64.80]] ([[User talk:151.40.64.80|talk]]) 11:49, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

::OK, now I see what's happening. First, let's look at those sources. They are talking about Italy's greatness, first in a general sense (the first reference) and also in a specifically economic sense (the second and third references).
:::<small>(By the way, the second and third aren't very confident -- the second one ironically says "''Saremo una grande potenza, ma possibile che non si riesca a organizzare uno straccio di difesa del territorio?''" (We may be a great power, but is it possible we cannot muster a shred of defence of the territory?) and "''Siamo una grande potenza economica, ma dov’è lo Stato?''" (We are a great economic power, but where is the sate?) The third one says "''CAOS POLITICO - L’Italia è ancora una grande potenza economica, a livello mondiale, visto che si colloca all’ottavo posto per produzione di merci e servizi. Da anni però il nostro paese soffre gravi difficoltà, acuite dal risultato elettorale di settimana scorsa.''" (POLITICAL CHAOS - Italy is still a great, world-class economic power, seeing that it ranks 8th in the production of goods and services. But for years our country has suffered grave difficulties, aggravated by the result of last week's elections.")</small>

::But look, we can easily agree that Italy is a great country in this general sense (and not only economically; also culturally). But that is not what this article is about. The articles [[Superpower]], [[Great power]] and this one, [[Middle power]], are describing terms that are used in some kinds of discussion by academics and perhaps some politicians. To be honest, I think it's a rather silly division, but since people do write in those terms, we have these articles to explain them, and we cite the writings. So, the "Middle powers" listed in this article are those that have been so called by various writers, nothing more.

::That is also why India and Brazil are listed here. It doesn't mean they are unimportant; it means that they were written about in cited sources. In fact, both those countries are also listed in [[Superpower#Potential superpowers]], as you may have noticed.

::Now for your edit request. What you said there was: "''The list of middle power must be changed .First of all countries must be divided in main,medium and small middle powers.''" But you offered no text, no sources, and no identification of which countries should be in each of the three subdivisions. Your three sources listed above say nothing about this main/medium/small subdivision. There is nothing actionable in the edit request, so it wasn't done. It couldn't be.

::If you want to pursue this I suggest that the best way to do so would be to open a new edit request, to be very precise as that exactly what should be changed/deleted/added in the article, and give links to justify each claim. Don't just make generalized rants, and don't say things like "ignorance rules" and "Try to better these 2 articles that make laugh millions people". That's just rude, and won't get you any cooperation from anyone. --[[User:Stfg|Stfg]] ([[User talk:Stfg|talk]]) 20:33, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

I know italian better than you and above all the 1st article supports Italy as great power.It's one of the main newspapers in Italy."Middle power" and "Great power" articles still make laugh  a lot of millions people.You didn't translate,but you made a partial traslation and interpretation of articles.In the italian sense they ALREADY consider Italy a great power naturally with all its limits.Italy as military it's stronger than Germany and even than some others.It has nuclear sharing and it owns its nuclear arsenal since 1968 (i can post citation).It's totally different from what you translated.About India and Brazil there are many articles too that support them as great powers.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.64.80|151.40.64.80]] ([[User talk:151.40.64.80|talk]]) 20:53, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

Here is the citation where the Minister of the Defence of Italy Luigi Gui in Parliament  knows that the CAMEN centre close Pisa was building nukes by Deputy Mr Niccolai.Deputy Mr Niccolai was in Parliament since 1968 and since 1970 in the Commission of the Italian Parliament for military affairs. Deputy Mr Niccolai in a clear way says that CAMEN (close Pisa and Camp Darby) is producing nukes.Many articles should be changed .These words are taken from official Italian Parliament talking.Now i wonder how Italy can't be considered a great power.One thing is reality one thing is the theoretical world of bla bla bla people.Italy even developed in 1973-76 an IRBM (1600km) and later other rockets able to be used like ICBM.IRBM Alfa rocket could  carry 1 Mt warhead and could be launched from frigates or destroyers.My father like all good officials of the Italian Air Force ,Army and  Navy know about it even there were secrets of state.It's supposed (the place not the existance) that italian nukes  are stored in La Spezia arsenal. And Japan and Germany have these things?But they are great powers)))).In the last Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report October 2013 we just discovered that the national global net wealth of Italy is larger than the british one and very very close to the french and to the german one.So Italy is member of the G7 (the economical-political summit with the 7 developed countries with the largest net national wealth-5th as national net wealth in developed countries list and 6th in the global list that considers China that is undeveloped),the G8 (the political summit,in fact russian financial weight is mostly 0.Italy weights about 12 times more than Russia) the G20 and whatelse and isn't a great power?There's something wrong in these 2 articles articles.I'd have shame to hold in this way these  2 articles.It's a matter of intellectual honesty and good feith as Wikipedia rightly asks.And the laugh can last.And now???)))))<ref>http://www.google.it/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&ved=0CD4QFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsulatestagiannilannes.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F08%2Fnucleare-militare-un-segreto-italiano.html&ei=2r9ZUpazGoTNtQaF_IDIBQ&usg=AFQjCNHaoI-HYSH6Dc4vBEytQhAqRSBQXw</ref>  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/151.40.64.80|151.40.64.80]] ([[User talk:151.40.64.80|talk]]) 21:39, 12 October 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Here is the citation about net wealth in the world.In the Databook of Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report October 2013 you can find much more detailed data.Let's go to check if there's something to change in this 2 articles.We find that UK and Russia (that is really 0 as financial weight.It's in the G8 just for political reasons) couldn't be great powers if Italy weren't.We discover that on the military level Germany and Japan couldn't be great powers if Italy weren't.India and Brazil should be included in the great powers with Italy too.India has net wealth and demography larger than Russia.Brazil has net wealth and nominal GDP larger than Russia.Do not changing leaves just the appearing (aka propaganda) in Wikipedia and not the truth.These are facts not opinions added by newspapers citations.There are 2 serious options: 1) Writing that great powers are the 5 main winners of the WWII with a permanent seat and veto power in the UN in the "Great power" article even if it is a dated concept.Today the weight of UN (see wars and other situations) is mostly 0.Wealth and weapons have a much more weight.In the "Middle power" article it's better to set back Germany and Japan and make distinctions between main and secondary middle powers.2)Adding to "Great power" article Italy,India and Brazil.In "Middle power" article it's always important to make distinctions between secondary and main powers.Impressive the silence that is following.But i cited what many didn't know (or knew  and didn't say for interest).Few italians hands write about Italy (like for its past,see Roman period) and many other countries hands wants to tell about it.Same for other states.We saw that here is moving for propaganda CIA,FSB and many others.Their activity is higher in economy,military, history and policy articles.They move with fantasy names as normal.The italian Homeland Security has been already informally informed.[[Special:Contributions/151.40.64.80|151.40.64.80]] ([[User talk:151.40.64.80|talk]]) 23:07, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

== Sudan as a Middle Power? ==

Sudan has no place within this document. I'm afraid to say it has very few characteristics that are associated with a Middle Power. Sudan is riddled with internal issues and rarely expresses any influence outside of its boarders. The country recently split in half due to instability causing the breakup of the nation. It has no economic clout, with its GDP per capita less then that of Palestine (a largely unrecognized state). It is located next to Egypt, a far more dominant country on every scale. Its military is respectable by African standards, but relies on outdated Soviet machinery. There is no supporting citations listed on the page. The simple question is this; If Sudan is a Middle Power, who is listening to it? --[[Special:Contributions/31.205.7.72|31.205.7.72]] ([[User talk:31.205.7.72|talk]]) 02:42, 8 November 2013 (UTC)

==Italy and Canada: Edits by Yogurto==
Broad consensus among academics is that neither are great powers and none of the sources you provide specifically state that they are. For example, the G7 may well be a forum of discussion for great powers, but that is not the same as saying Italy and Canada are great powers - because the G7 may well include both great and middle powers while still qualifying as a forum for great powers (because at-least some great powers are present). Instead of edit-warring poorly sourced material, which currently constitutes [[WP:OR]], I suggest you talk it out here first. [[User:Antiochus the Great|Antiochus the Great]] ([[User talk:Antiochus the Great|talk]]) 15:20, 6 January 2015 (UTC)

I dont speak english well but now I try to explain my edits.
I agree that there is not broad consensus (BTW, same for India or even Germany and Japan). In fact i did not make this edit in the page known as [[Great Powers]], but in the section "Overlaps between Great powers and middle powers" which I thought it was the correct space for my edits. Sorry but I didnt think it was necessary to find a consensus over sourced material and still i find hard to believe that. Please do not say that i started the edit war because i did not. I did not mean to offend you and [[User:Tide rolls|'''<span style="color:White;background:darkRed">Tide</span>''']][[User talk:Tide rolls|'''<span style="color:darkRed">rolls'''</span>]]. Sorry if you feel or have felt offended by my edits or by my reverts.

So, Yesterday I made the following edits:

I wrote that Italy and Canada are sometimes/rarely listed among Great Powers.

1)I quote  Professor Kirton  "Finally, the status hierarchy of the international system at the time (Gotlieb 1978) supported the claim that Canada and Italy deserved the status of great powers and hence inclusion (in contrast to other "upper middle powers" such as India and Brazil)"
(here is the source: http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/scholar/kirton198901/kcon1.htm). That is what i mean with "overlaps between great powers and middle powers".

2)Sources supporting the same view of Kirton: the G7/G8 as an informal meeting of great powers. 
https://books.google.it/books?id=EK9bv2QlRuoC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=Great+power+summit+G8&source=bl&ots=ulS118sQNN&sig=fvfHCuZCKbkjY1RqEeIPYW_SCjU&hl=it&sa=X&ei=_jmoVLftJsnfavnagYAF&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBQ

https://books.google.it/books?id=3t2vhlvF0l8C&pg=PA1988&lpg=PA1988&dq=Great+power+summit+G8&source=bl&ots=MojVfoIV8V&sig=p-1Y_X2CIUMb3gJWN6TjvNy-mwk&hl=it&sa=X&ei=hjuoVJewFsLaas-zgfgB&ved=0CDAQ6AEwBzgK

https://books.google.it/books?id=swfHBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT243&lpg=PT243&dq=G7+great+power&source=bl&ots=-6iFuxjFXL&sig=p842upho6w73jiZg8mj1A-0QSj4&hl=it&sa=X&ei=vz2oVOeaHsnlaMqggvAD&ved=0CDQQ6AEwCA

The sources do NOT say that all of the G8 members are great powers except Italy and Canada. Those sources simply say that the G7/G8 is an informal summit of great powers. That means that its members are great powers according to those analysts. This is what i mean with "There are also some sources listing Italy and Canada among great powers". Have you ever find an analyst saying that The UN assembly or the G20 are meetings of great powers? no, because not all of its members are great powers. 
This way to think is contained also in the old source (Again: http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/scholar/kirton198901/kcon1.htm) which basically say that in a forum of great powers there are only great powers.

3)And finally there are sources of The telegraph, The guardian etc.. describing the G7/G8 members as "the eigth great powers, the seven world powers etc..."

Is the onus on me? You reverted my edits first.

But It is very important and interesting that the title says that the G8 members and China are Great powers.

As i said I dont want to list Italy and Canada as Great Powers 100%, because there are more sources not considering them great powers. The section "Overlaps between great powers and middle powers"  in this page (Middle power) is the one correct for them, because quoting again Prof Kirton "Finally, the status hierarchy of the international system at the time (Gotlieb 1978) supported the claim that Canada and Italy deserved the status of great powers and hence inclusion (in the G7)." And the G7/G8 is still considered an informal meeting of great powers by a lot of media and some academics who list Canada and Italy among great powers without making clear distinction of status with the countries most referred as great powers like UK or France.

Are there any oppositions? Tell me what you think. Sorry for my english.

:Thanks for taking the matter to the talk page Yogurto, and no apologies necessary for your English. I understand what your saying very well! You make some compelling arguments, especially that the section is called "Overlaps between great powers and middle powers" and as such, it ''is'' possible that we could include Italy and Canada there. However, I still think we should wait perhaps a day or two more to allow other editors time to come here and express their opinions. For now, I will continue to study the sources you have provided.

Okay, Thank you!

:I agree with [[User:Yogurto|Yogurto]]. We have a reasonable number of sources to include Italy, Canada and maybe Brazil in that section.

*http://cartographie.sciences-po.fr/sites/default/files/17_2_g8etchine_droite.jpg  (Yogurto/Italy and Canada listed among Great powers)

*http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/catalogue/3303331600596/index.shtml (Yogurto/Italy as a great power)

*http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/scholar/kirton198901/kcon1.htm) (Yogurto/Italy and Canada seen as countries having Great power status)

And i have a new source.

*http://www.hcss.nl/reports/why-are-pivot-states-so-pivotal-the-role-of-pivot-states-in-regional-and-global-security/150/ (Italy and Canada listed among Great powers. It talks also about Brazil)
It makes sense to distinguish G7 nations and BRIC states from the other middle powers.

Nations such as [[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] are generally considered to be [[great powers]] due to their economic, military and strategic importance, their status as [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|recognised]] [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|nuclear powers]] and their permanent seats on the [[UN Security Council]].

== Why I deleted Azerbaijan ==

Azerbaijan has no place within this document. I'm afraid to say it has very few characteristics that are associated with a Middle Power. While it's the richest country in the Caucasus, the only countries it has influenced are Georgia and Armenia, the latter of which is in war with Azerbaijan. It has no economic clout, with its GDP (nominal, 2015) being less then that of Ethiopia (a very poor state). It borders with Russia and Iran, and both are far more dominant countries on every scale. The simple question is this: If Azerbaijan is a Middle Power, who is listening to it? --[[User:Funny Gardaland|Funny Gardaland]] ([[User talk:Funny Gardaland|talk]]) 14:49, 3 June 2016 (UTC)
:In fact, Azerbaijan '''ONLY''' considers itself to be an important player. It's not in reality. --[[User:Funny Gardaland|Funny Gardaland]] ([[User talk:Funny Gardaland|talk]]) 04:30, 6 June 2016 (UTC)

== Ireland ==

Ireland produces many products, most notably beer. It's 43th in the 2015 GDP count. Diplomacy and relationships are an integral part of power. Ireland's close alliance with the UK makes it more important. Independent of this relationship, Ireland is still a far greater power than, say, Hungary in every discernible way. Ireland arguably is a middle power, relative to its ranking compared to other countries. --[[User:Funny Gardaland|Funny Gardaland]] ([[User talk:Funny Gardaland|talk]]) 11:07, 4 June 2016 (UTC)
:{{ping|Funny Gardaland}} You keep apologising for not finding sources but keep adding contentious countries, even admitting in edit summaries "I can't find sources". That is not acceptable. I dispute the inclusion of several unsourced countries you have added, such as Ireland and Kuwait. Please find sources or they will be removed.

==Origin of the term==
I'm pretty sure the term "middle" power was invented (or at least popularised) by Canadian PM [[Louis St. Laurent]] and I have it down in print, but I can't find an internet source on this. Anyone else know anything about the origin of the term. [[User:Kevlar67|Kevlar67]] 14:47, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

: Thinking that you have the term's source, and having a mostly-referenced article are two very different things.  Beyond the source of the term, there is not definition or criteria of the term, and no explanation as to why certain countries are part of the this article as opposed to others.  Until there are references for those things, the template ought to remain.  As I said before, this article is basically Original Research at this point. &mdash;[[User:Thames|thames]] 20:49, 26 April 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding comment signed as by [[User:Thames|Thames]] ([[User talk:Thames|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thames|contribs]]) was actually added by [[User:Perceval|Perceval]] ([[User talk:Perceval|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Perceval|contribs]]) - </small>

== Limiting List ==
The easiest way to prevent the list of middle powers from growing too big is to only include those we have references for.  I found a reference for Canada in [[the Canadian Encyclopedia]], which is [http://www.tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0005274 here online].  Please only add nations to the list that you have sources for.  [[User:Kevlar67|Kevlar67]] 07:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

: The problem with that is there is no defintion for middle power so to include references would be pointless. In addition while Canada is universally regarded as a middle power it not so just because the "Canadian Encyclopedia" says so. Do you realise that source is worthless becuase of it's bias. [[User:Ronan.evans|Ronan.evans]] 03:53, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:: If there is no definition then we shouldn't have this article.  But more to the point, Canada was the original country to be called a middle power, which is why I found the reference so easily.  If other countries are frequently termed "middle powers" then there will be plenty of references.   Furthermore the Canadian Encyclopedia is no more biased than Britannica or Compton's or World Book.  [[User:Kevlar67|Kevlar67]] 08:51, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

Here are some more references:

* [http://www.ubcpress.ubc.ca/search/title_book.asp?BookID=4535 University of British Columbia]

Oh and here's an interesting academic paper about whether or not South Africa is really a middle power or not, and just generally about the definition of "Middle Power".  I think there is much in this paper that our article should adress. See: [http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No13/Solomon.html South African Foreign Policy and Middle Power Leadership].  Now that wasn't so hard.  Why can everyone do that?  [[User:Kevlar67|Kevlar67]] 09:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

: Ok, thanks for the info. I can see where you are coming from and now that you have explained it it makes sense- but still I think you have to apply some common sense here. The list will never grow otherwise. [[User:58.178.23.143|58.178.23.143]] 10:52, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

: I quote the article, "Middle power is a term used in the field of international relations to describe states that are not superpowers or great powers, but still have some influence internationally." One could put up a fairly convincing argument that Australia has just as much- if not more- influence on the world stage as Canada. Certainly in the present political climate Australia is percieved as a closer ally to the U.S. than Canada thus having a greater influence. Also Australia's influence come's through it's location. It is certainly the most important western democracy in the whole of South East Asia which makes it a very important voice in this stategicly important region. Also where does Japan fit into the whole Super Power/ Middle Power arrangment? [[User:Ronan.evans|Ronan.evans]] 10:59, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

::I think your right in suggesting that Australia has a greater presence/visibility on the international stage. Canada certainly is able to be more visible but its geographic position with the US tends to promote a 'taken-for-grantedness' as its a pretty stable and benign position. - [[User:Htra0497|Htra0497]] 28th August 2006 06:10 (AET)  <small>[20:10, 27 August 2006 (UTC)]</small>

== Dig More Digging ==
I think I can now say why Canada ''thought of herself'' as a middle power, whether or not the title was appropriate.  But I can also say with certainty that many recent writers are very critical of the term. See
* [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=55238227] *[http://www.mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=930] *[http://www.canada25.com/downloadreport.html] *[http://www.irpp.org/miscpubs/archive/030626e.pdf] *[http://www.cda-cdai.ca/presentations/middlepowergoestomarginsjun05.htm] *[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-3398722_ITM]

* I totally agree<p>
And Poland and Ukraine Middle Powers? Since when,they are totally dominated by foreign Nations and foreign capital. They have capabilities to be Middle Powers like Turkey is,but they don't have such independence from other powers like Turkey and less they have influence in others, only in very small nations near, like Lithuania.<p>
And if they are Middle Powers so is Sweden, Portugal, Egypt and many others. Sweden is almost a Regional Power for Scandinavia and northern Europe, Egypt the same for Arab World and northern Africa and Portugal for it's old colonies and because of all Lusophone World. Portugal has the CPLP, the equivalent to British Commonwealth.<p>
As for Italy and Brazil, if they are included in this list, they are also Regional Powers and in the case of Italy Global/Great Power. In what we stand: Middle, Regional, Global?
Of course Brazil is a Regional Power in Latin/South America but it's also a Middle Power in world stage.<br>
As for Italy it is a Regional Power in southern Europe, the Mediterranean and even Europe as a whole or in EU and it's also a Global/Great Power in World stage. Middle Power it isn't or at least in the way it once was - an ally of USA, NATO and EEC(EU) that agreed always with the others. Now Italy has gained respect and power in the World and takes care of it's interests with agreement with others but in it self-interest first and showing signs of power inthe missions it's involved.

== We need a definition ==
We need a definition for which countries ought to be included in the middle powers list. Someone added Poland. Since there is no definition, I cannot object to anyone adding any country which is obviously not unimportant to the list. I added Greece, with the rationale that it is in the UN Security Council, NATO, EU, has great influence (economic and diplomatic) in the Balkans, participated in both World Wars, and had some successes in World War II, and Athens presents some evidence of a global city under formation. [[User:NerdyNSK|NerdyNSK]] 17:19, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

: Unfortunately both the friend of Poland and yourself are doing what's called ‘’original research’’.  That is, you are drawing your own conclusions based on what you know.  In any other medium that would be commendable.  But not in Wikipedia.  Really the list should only consist of countries called middle powers ''in published literature''.  I've tried to enforce that rule, but people keep adding more countries faster than I can take them off.  If I don't have support from other editors to help me keep the list down, then it's hopeless.  In fact last time I tried to keep the list down, I was accused of "preventing others from editing".  (see above).  Perhaps I'll try again.  Anyway it's not up to us to create a definition of Middle Power-hood.  It's our job to find out what published sources say about it, and act on that.  [[User:Kevlar67|Kevlar67]] 18:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

:: You are right that we were engaging in some sort of ''original research''. The list looks like it is based on gut feeling rather than a definition or reference, so I removed it. I added a new list based on a reference (Wood). We can add more, but we should take care not to confuse middle powers with [[regional power]]s. Better to have multiple lists like "researcher A published this list, while researcher B that list" rather than a general list. Then, with lists based on explicit references, we can resist "gut feeling original research" additions. Some open tasks for anyone who has time to improve the article: 1) add wikilinks to the new list, 2) change my Wood reference to Wikipedia's standard format for references, 3) I have no time to update my map right now, so you may like to help with it, too (perhaps multiple maps per references list, for now let's make it a map based on what Mr Wood says).

Both Germany and Italy are well-placed in this list. There are sources that describe both countries as middle powers and it's also common sense that Italy and Germany do neither have the military capabilities of France or Britain nor the diplomatic skills and contacts that France and Britain could keep alive after the downfall of their empires. As a compromise, Italy and Germany could maybe be described as 'advanced middle powers'. This would be an appropriate way to distinguish them from other middle powers such as Finland, I suppose.

This country has shown great diplomatic skills in the past.)  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.212.53.132|82.212.53.132]] ([[User talk:82.212.53.132|talk]]) 09:26, 1 October 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Wood’s work: insufficient and irrelevant ==
<u>First of all, thank you Kevin for your work, anyway, let me explain my doubts.</u>

The article "Middle powers in 2005" is a wrong view since finds its bases on an incomplete work, since the matter it holds must be explain, or interpreted, through many parameters and not the merely one here used: I mean GNP term.
Further the term “Middle Powers” isn’t a relevant matter to have a lemma: it is single opinion, unilaterally based. To achieve its own value it needs a major support.
Honestly speaking the list (once attached as a classification, as well as the one present now) and the map attached – furthermore India, China, Italy are considered major powers from the most, even they present many more lacks, put in debates, than other, as they are almost always among the first ten positions in lists per parameter, not only economical, as a matter of study with outstanding source such as the IMF and the different organizations of the UN, far to academic studies; furthermore, note that Italy is clearly in debate per Military terms but the same debate originates disputes since internationally, per presence and diplomacy ability, she’s ranked 3rd) – surely come from the work of B. Wood, so they have a some kind of support, but, the question is: may GNP itself allow a so kind of work to be made?
First of all it’s difficult draw a so large pictured “hit-parade” of Nations if we think to cultural differences, political meaning even in international matters, history, population, territorial specifics such as morphology or weather, raw materials and energy availability and so on (examples from things which are the so-called "economical substratum"), anyway economists try to explain a so-called status of a Nation looking at many terms, making it easy (usually for "non-scholars") the same terms can be easily put into four general terms each of them includes a large bouquet of ways of measurement. Only one among these four general terms asks for Economy Status (or Power): and this is something giant to measure! 

The GNP term quantifies the movements of budget well recognizable in the same movements explained through GNI term (someone considers GNP long to be the same as GNI or, at least, its younger brother). Surely, GNP often finds correspondences in a given Nation's status (note: in its Economy), but it's not enough: neither in case we are trying to have a "hit" or a "status picture" nor when even only a single of the a.m. four terms is needed, this means GNP is able to explain only a tone of a whole.
In case of Welfare, and also Wikipedia simply explains in the page about GNP, as many other measure terms, the GNP suffers while trying to measure "life", hence, explain "indirect unpaid activities" (not paid actions which don't create short-term economical and not directly measurable changes) as well as "indirect paid activities" (paid actions whose effects are not directly/immediately measurable in economical terms). Furthermore GNP isn't able to explain what I quoted above as "economical substratum": things with a very high meaning nobody must forget in the case of work upon these sensible things. 
And again GNP is responsive to the exchange movements of currencies, it hasn't a large reference period while other terms has, so scholars prefer to avoid a wide use of GNP term, replacing it with ampler (such as GDP, and the related PPP, and, for Welfare, the more precise and suitable HDI term).
Even, GNP is less malleable than other terms (where, for example, nominal ratios and real ratios are present, allowing better and more detailed economic measurements), and it does not explain political choices, military presence anywhere, freedom of a Nation as well as its ability in diplomacy competition (wrong, right: don't care) and so on.
Wood has tried to explain through GNP terms (merely insufficient) far to the Welfare. This means Germany, despite of all, should have a lower place than UK and Italy, at the same level, or even lower if compared to a little higher France, consequently this does not match with dedicate term of Welfare’s measure like the HDI or similar.
This is a further confirmation that GNP might not be considered suitable to explain all the sides of Economy, let us imagine for all the sides of a Nation.

Works, such as the one used as the base to this article (and the lemma), are supposed to be able to list nothing more than the term they obtain bases from (in this case GNP).

Recording does not allow anything out of the objectivity of a record: this means a single opinion (or work) will be never enough especially in those cases (as in the present lemma / article) in which the same opinion (or work) is not worth itself as a way to explain a whole: then it might be misinterpreted for arrogance (or so it seems).
Encyclopaedia’s modern idea bore in XVIII century with the solo purpose to record well-recognized universal matters and experiences of knowledge.
So this should also be the column to support Wikipedia as an encyclopaedia. A matter becomes universal when the most part (or almost the most) agrees with a unique "truth" (please, allow me using this term). Even, “universal” does not mean "you must accept" any case.
Sure: studies are welcome since they allow a matter to become universal but they do not become universal when many other studies disagree with the same strength. It's a opinion: we're free to accept or not, awaiting it is universally consolidated (and differently from this case, strong enough to explain a whole) so use it as a term of comparison.
I can spend my time to find the Napoleon's white horse was, instead, black. I can get an evidence of that. But I cannot issue my work, spread it as universal, and the work used to draw an entire lemma of encyclopaedia, or take it to an evening news. Only if many other opinions will agree the horse will change colour.

The article surely may be cited somewhere here in Wikipedia, first making the title different and not "Middle powers in 2005": it is illusive. But why? Did Wood and his incomplete work decide? Anyway still no sense. Who does the idea belong to? Is the Wood's work worth enough in this case? Is the Wood's strong enough (and with good foundations) to draw a list of Nations?

<b>Request</b>

I think the work to be ok, but merely incomplete: good as a work on GNP power, with serious lacks when we're trying to compare the Nations (thing slightly more difficult...).
The work might be cited in the GNP page (and not here) as a comparison of Nation's GNP: the same, Wikipedians are doing in many other cases (..GDP, PPP, HDI and so on pages). 
This article in this lemma is only a spot: I claim for this matter to be verified. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Lysmark|Lysmark]] ([[User talk:Lysmark|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lysmark|contribs]]) 12:55, 8 April 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->

==Australia a middle power==
Shouldnt there be a article for Australia? I just recently looked at the history and found it deleted.Australia is a middle power aswell as a regional power since it has influence over the Pacific nations, New Zealand and quite of Southeast asia.It has the 5th strongest economy, biggest military force in Oceania and a stable democratic government. It has served about 6 to 8 times in the UN security council and plays a huge role in peacekeeping missions.Therefore,i think it should be added. [[User:Terrya|Terrya]] 12:40, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

If you really don't know why they're seriously nowhere near being in the same power league as each other then you obviously don't have sufficient knowledge about world economics, world militaries, and international politics to be writing an article on this subject.

== Great Powers and Middle Powers ==
There is a discrepancy when it comes to the term Great and Middle Powers in academia. Some people believe that there are several Great powers out there while others believe that there are no great powers and only one super power. This article lists countries and is someplace in the middle, it lists commonly associated modern day Great powers like France and the UK but leaves out China and Russia.

:According to Encarta : "''Today’s great powers—the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China—all have large military forces and substantial nuclear weapons capabilities. Japan and Germany—with huge economies and relatively large military forces but no nuclear weapons—also qualify as great powers. These seven states control over half of the world’s economy, 68 percent of world military spending, 27 percent of its soldiers, 95 percent of arms exports, and 99 percent of nuclear weapons. The only other states of comparable economic size are Italy and perhaps India, neither of which has the global outlook or military strength to qualify as a great power. India, which now has nuclear weapons capability, and Brazil are regional giants that have the potential to become great powers in the 21st century.''"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761590309/Great_Powers.html]

Most common day knowledge would say that there are at least 5 Great Powers, United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China with the US being the only Super power. They all have Nuclear weapons, Hold permanent seats on the UN security counsel, are major players in world affairs & hold most of the worlds wealth. I think that we can find references for both Great and middle powers for all but the United states. So either the list should be updated to include the 2 missing great powers with a note stating that all 4 are also considered great powers or the 2 great powers listed should be removed. -- [[User:UKPhoenix79|UKPhoenix79]] ([[User talk:UKPhoenix79|talk]]) 22:22, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

==Russia a middle power?==
I don't think Russia should be listed as a middle power. First of all, the only source used is from the mid to late 90s. For anyone who's unaware, Russia was at a low point during that period, and have rebounded quite a bit. They're currently the worlds largest [[energy superpower]], [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|largest nuclear power]], and is the worlds second strongest military power according to US intelligence[http://abcnews.go.com/WN/story?id=3728855]. But if all that isn't enough, even the content in the article itself barely considers Russia a "middle power". Here's what it says:

*''"In the 1990's, with the collapse of Soveit Russia, one might suggest that a fourth middle power has emerged....""

*"''Having established the United Nations Security Council veto as an objective criterion to differentiate between states, and regognize that veto status has remained unchanged, '''one must conclude that, for organizational purposes, the end of the Cold War has had little impact on power status.'''''"

So even the article contradicts the idea of Russia being a middle power, only suggesting that "some might suggest" the possibility, but then goes on to "conclude" that power status hasn't changed. I personally think the age of the article itself warrants the deletion of Russia from the list, but even the source itself doesn't call Russia a middle power. What does everyone else think?[[Special:Contributions/99.240.27.210|99.240.27.210]] ([[User talk:99.240.27.210|talk]]) 06:46, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:As for your POV that this reference is old, I would disagree with you as power structures change slowly. I find your review of the reference intresting though. I would suggest you adding your view with references calling Russia a Great Power in the article as there exists for other countries like UK. [[User:Farmanesh|Farmanesh]] ([[User talk:Farmanesh|talk]]) 15:11, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

::Why would you argue to keep Russia on the list though? It's not supported by this article or any other that I could find. Whoever added it in the first place was mistaken to do so, therefor keeping Russia listed isn't justified without a relevant source. 

::I'm going to remove Russia from the list until someone can provide a reliable, accurate source stating that Russia is a middle power, citing [[Wikipedia:No original research]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]].

::* "''Wikipedia does not publish original research (OR) or original thought. This includes unpublished facts, arguments, speculation, and ideas; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position.''

::* "''The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that readers should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.''"

::*''"The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. '''All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation.[1] The source must be cited clearly and precisely to enable readers to find the text that supports the article content in question.'''"''

::Also, although this is irrelevant, for arguments sake I disagree about power structures changing slowly. 20th century history gives many examples of power structure changing rapidly. Germany went from a broken shell of a country in 1918 to a economic and technologic powerhouse in the 30s. The Ottoman empire lost its role on the world stage in the snap of a finger after WWI, as did Austria-Hungary. The Soviet Union before and after WWII, as another example, went from a famine stricken third would country to one of the two leading superpowers in the span of 10-15 years. Then of course when it collapsed, it only took a year or two for them to lose superpower status, going from challenging America militarily, to being even barely able to win parts of their own country back militarily (Chechnya).

== Delete self created list ==
I think we should delete thist list, and post lists that are created by reputable experts only.

For example the [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0005274 Canadian Encyclopedia] is used for France and the United Kingdom being "''Current Middle powers''", while the article itself clearly states it is about the early postwar years after WWII. Even though I haven't checked all the other references, I'm expecting similar issues, and hope others follow this line of thought. But if not we should at least work on putting years of publication for the sources at the references section. Though my proposal remains to use lists such as [http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No13/Solomon.html this one], and with it clearly state who created it, what criteria were used, and during what year it was published. <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 09:12, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

Even though I think the list is valuable, we must clearly state it is from that year - instead of blending it all together as "''Current Middle Powers''". And the latter remains my main issue here. No matter how academic and scientific all used sources are, if they are being used mindlessly, it will no longer be reliable material that is being provided. But original research instead.

And that's a bit old for "''current middle powers''" in such a fast evolving world. I belief China can not be accurately covered with just a list item, it's somewhere in the between going from middle power / low income country to global power or possibly superpower. China is listed as middle power by Bernard Wood in his 1988 publication, but Hussein Solomon who uses that list in his 1997 article comments on it: "''A second area of contention is: which China is Wood referring to? If the reference is to the People's Republic of China, then it could convincingly be argued that it is more a great power and a nascent superpower than a middle power. If Wood is referring to Taiwan, his classification is similarly problematic, as Taiwan is not recognised as an independent sovereign state by international law.''".

Maybe we should just remove China, UK and France and leave the remaining countries in this category.

I have retracted the last statement I made. I am going to let Everyroad make his own judgement, but my decision to keep Russia in the list was actually because the UK, France and China were also included. As Russia, UK, France and China are of approximately equivalent status in the world it seems unreasonable that one should be there and not the others.

== Proposal Current Middle Powers ==
I have done some work on creating a proposed new "''current middle powers''" section. It can be viewed here: [[User:Species8473/Middle]]. I have put more focus on the 1988 list, because it is the only good and more or less complete list we have. And so it can be made clear on what criteria it is based, and it allows the notes from Solomon to be included. I have also put more focus on describing why countries are considered middle powers - unfinished but it should give the idea. The map I made a bit bigger (it fits on 1024x768 or higher with the table), and it has different colors for the 1988 list and "''other countries''" with an extra legend option for "''great power''" China. I have thought about making Germany and Japan yellow too, with the note of them being economic great powers - but haven't decided on it yet. I did forget to color Spain but that will happen in a next update. <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 17:48, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

I have a few issues with your proposal. Firstly, I don't think we should give particular emphasis to Wood and Solomon's POV over other sources' especially considering their list is at least 20 years old and the commentary 11 years old. Therefore, I feel by distingusing sources on the map by grouping countries by colour based on Wood's list or on other criteria is not really appropriate. The fact that China is listed also raises a few eyebrows given its prominence in the world stage today and the aforementioned antiquated perspective. It is perhaps worth noting that Wood's pool of middle powers is explained based on the follow criteria: "Some proponents of middle power leadership use Gross National Product (GNP) as the best general indicator of national power. Thus, Wood15 argues, "GNP automatically captures aggregate economic power, wealth and/or population size, and to a substantial extent, military potential ..." On the basis of using GNP [prior to 1988] as a criterion for identifying middle powers, Wood arrives at a list of states which includes:" Given China's surge in GNP (now above all other great powers except for the US) in past years, it looks increasing clear that it does not belong on that list. 
Also, I don't really agree with presenting a list ranking middle powers based on GNP as it is only one method. Therefore, I think the current list of middle powers we have + other middles powers backed up by sources will work best provided that we vet all the sources (which it appears you've done).

:The issues you name all exist in the current article, where they are ignored - making them even bigger. In my version they are addressed. By clearly stating the year of publication, and citing Hussein Solomon on his (critical) comments. Some particular emphasis to the list I belief is justified, as it is the only seemingly complete list we have. I agree that alphabetical order may be better, in favor of GNP ranking, even though it was simply copied from the source like that. <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 21:12, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

:I think we all agree that the Bernard Wood list is a bit "''antiquated''". China back then was a middle power, today it is a great power. A simple look at the old World bank GDP statistics is enough. During the 1985-1998 period, when Bernard Wood did his study, it was just in between the middle powers Canada and Brazil. Since then it has grown with a factor 10, and today it ranks at place four among the other great powers.

:I agree with Colliver. The list of "Current Middle Powers" is supposed to reflect reality as close as possible to recently. I'm sure we all agree that a case of middle power status may have been possible to make for China 20 or 30 years ago but is no longer apt. I agree that by adding commentary perhaps in a footnote stating China may have been considered in the past as a middle power may work. Otherwise, the inclusion of China makes the list obsolete for the label "Current Middle Powers". It seems upon surface observation that China is the only significant abberation from the list. By the same token, going by nominal GDP, one would observe Russia (a purported great power) ranks #11 in 2007 with $1,291,011 million. Under the criteria of nominal GDP, it would categorically classify as a middle power. This is probably obvious given the fact the list of compiled during the Cold War and hardly relevant currently.

::One interesting thing I found out is that a year ago the Bernard Wood list was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middle_power&oldid=99324390 published in the article], without any other listed countries. Since then editors have damaged the article by adding any webpage as reference, as long as it had a match on middle power and the country name. That now mostly is fixed, but I still think the approach of that version is much better. Besides China, lets have a look at Algeria. During 1985 it ranked #29 on the World Bank GDP list, today it has dropped to place #48. In our list it does have two other sources[http://www.disarm.emb-japan.go.jp/statements/Statement/kyoto020807.htm 1][http://books.google.com/books?id=kZlDRD2vL6IC 2]. The first doesn't say Algeria is a middle power, and the second says Algeria may be a middle power. Between 1991 and 2002 there was a major civil war in Algeria (see [[Algerian Civil War]]), with a death count of 150,000 to 200,000. Even though the list may be mostly correct for current middle powers, the used method is flawed, and prone to error. While this can be easily avoided by presenting the Bernard Wood list as 1988 list, instead of using it as reference for todays middle powers. Another good change I think would be using the title "''Middle Power Status''" instead of "''Current Middle Powers''". <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 14:53, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

My personal opinion on this: Singapore, Chile and Czech are ranking a lot better, but we know they are not among the great powers - so judging from this list they simply are middle powers with a growing economy. Argentina has dropped, but still ranks well compared with other middle powers. For Algeria, Egypt and Iran I would say it's possible they no longer are among the middle powers - so we need to check what experts say about them. <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 21:15, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

:Besides the Wood list there are two other sources for Iran in the article [http://web.mit.edu/ISG/iaqfall04ahouie.htm 1][http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmfaff/363/36310.htm 2]. One identifies Iran as a "''regional middle power''", with in the footnotes "''by regional middle power I mean a state which may rank as no more than a middle power in the global system but which is a key actor in its regional system''". It doesn't say Iran is a middle power. The other article is down - even though I believe it worked a few days ago (I don't appear to have broken it with my changes, and may simply have looked over it). Iran today may not be a middle power, and if it is we need a recent reliable source. The same goes for Algeria. Quoting myself: "''During 1985 it ranked #29 on the World Bank GDP list, today it has dropped to place #48. In our list it does have two other sources[http://www.disarm.emb-japan.go.jp/statements/Statement/kyoto020807.htm 1][http://books.google.com/books?id=kZlDRD2vL6IC 2]. The first doesn't say Algeria is a middle power, and the second says Algeria may be a middle power. Between 1991 and 2002 there was a major civil war in Algeria (see [[Algerian Civil War]]), with a death count of 150,000 to 200,000.''". Egypt is not mentioned in Woods list of middle powers, and is cited from two sources [http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/mons97a.html 1][http://www.gsinstitute.org/mpi/pubs/buildingbridges_0404.pdf 2]. The first one doesn't seem to say Egypt is a middle power, the second does but is what I see as poor source and only lists it in the footnotes. <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 21:35, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

: Interesting chart. I'm curious where you accessed the World Bank GDP statistics for previous years - I have a feeling that older data may be a bit unreliable. A few things to keep in mind: it is much easier for rank to jump and fall for smaller (lower ranked) economies which is why you don't see much movement in the larger economies. Also, like we've said before GDP is not the only measure of middle power status. Geopolitics, diplomatic styles, power in international organizations (UN Security Council) all play a role.

:: The GDP statistics are from the World Bank, I did note that to the top of the table, but here are two links with the actual numbers [http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp-economy-gdp&date=1985 1][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) 2]. I don't entirely share your feeling that older data may be unreliable, the oldest list available on that website is from 1960 - so by 1985 the World Bank already had at least 25 years of experience with creating them. I do agree that using only GDP for defining middle powers isn't perfect - but the only seemingly complete list we have uses that as criteria. And if we would put it seperate from other sources, we could actually make note of such issues as they have been commented on by other academics. I will request a [[WP:3O|third opinion]] on that - for some fresh thought. I do think this table shows that the position of quite a number of countries has changed a lot. <font color="#365a92">[[User:Species8473|=Species8473=]]</font> <sup>[[User talk:Species8473|(talk)]]</sup> 00:58, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

::::Aircraft Carriers do not define Great Powers, nor do they define Middle Powers. A Great Power is often translated as "World Power", which is generally accepted to apply to nations with leading economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence around the globe. The UK is still by far among the top tier of Great Powers and out performs most of the current great powers economically, culturally, militarily, scientifically and politically. The UKs status as a recognized Nuclear power and member of the United Nations Security Council are major indications of its Great Power status and global importance. The fact that the UK is both relevant and present when it comes to international discussions regarding N Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria etc isn't a token of good will or down to pure chance, but because the UKs global interests, voice and opinions are as relevant and as respected as ever. The point im trying to get at is - the UK exercises all the characteristics of a Great Power and is seen by her Government and most of the world as one too. India on the other hand is largely unimportant and unable to act as a global player. Canada and Australia are consulted with more in international discussions than India. Good luck in the Olympics!

:::Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Italy, Mexico, South Korea and Spain are major middle powers as they all have significant GDPs and military budgets. Although significant GDPs and military budgets make these countries more powerful than ordinary middle powers they are weaker than great powers, notably due to a lack of a nuclear capability which could wreak destruction across the globe and lack of a permanent UN Security Council seat and great power veto which grants enormous diplomatic power, in addition to possessing smaller GDPs and military budgets than great powers. Japan and Germany are often cited as great powers despite their lack of nuclear capability and permanent UN Security Council seats because both countries have immense economic power as a result of their huge GDPs and massive share of global trade, and considerable military power as a result of near great power levels of military expenditure.

India most certainly belongs in the list of middle powers; India is still a backward developing nation whose HUGE uneducated population still believe in witches, hence the many rapes and killings of girls and women accused of being witches. Some as young as 4 years old! Then the fact that India is home to approx 1/3rd of the worlds poor and its GDP per-capita is one of the lowest in the world. Economically India offers nothing to the world except a growing consumer market where nations like Britain have a trade surplus selling goods and services to India's growing but still very small middle class. India's IT sector which Indians often boast about is one of the finest in Asia, but in comparison to their European, N American and even S American counterparts performs very poorly as expected. The lack of infrastructure in India is appalling and is below that of most  developing African nations. 

India is in receipt of $Billions of foreign aid from Europe and North America. India's GDP of 1.5 trillion is very average for middle power status, but combine that figure with India's massive population and that 1.5 trillion economy counts for nothing - India's taxable value per capita is one of the lowest in the world on par with 3rd world countries. The quality of life in India and life expectancy speaks for its self.

As for India's military it is too small to meet regional demands, with India's armed forces split between its eastern and western borders Pakistan and China would make short work of India. India's armed forces are reliant on manpower recruited from India's peasant classes who are poorly trained and equipped in comparison to other middle powers. India's armed forces are large but not powerful and woefully ineffective lacking beyond regional power and influence. Technologically India is 20 years behind and relies on Israel, France, Russia and Britain to supply weapons technology.

Culturally India is a nobody on the world stage

I think you misread my words. India is not yet even a middle power. India's GDP of 1.7 trillion (please correct your
figures) is so small it is irrelevant to the world economy. That is why India should be deleted from the list of middle
powers. Even the Indian moon probe is 60 years behind technologically advanced superpowers like UK. At best, India
could be included in the list of sub-minor powers, if there is one. There have been some typos in the Queen's speech
to English Parliament because of which she read out that she wants a special relationship with India. [[User:Aban1313|Aban1313]] ([[User talk:Aban1313|talk]]) 13:33, 21 October 2011 (UTC)Aban1313

:India is an emerging market and there are historic ties and a large Indian migrant community in Britain. George Osborne also said Britain has a special relationship with Ireland, for similar reasons. India is conventionally classified among the middle powers, as the sources show. Moon probes and special relationships for trade or sentiment have nothing to do with it.

::: There is only one old reference that calls India a middle power. India is more like a minor/sub-minor/microscopic power. It is unthinkable that India is as powerful as a major middle power like Denmark! Btw, Britain doesn't HAVE a special relationship with India, in the words of Cameron, it is soliciting one "in a spirit of humility"; there is a BIG difference.

::::It's called diplomacy, acknowledging post-colonial sensitivities in India and using flattery to get around New Delhi's emotional insecurity. If that's your evidence, you have no basis for your case, and more sources have already been added which confirm it. The security reality means that Pakistan is more important to Britain than India.

::::: Funny how Britain didnt need to flatter India in last 60 years. Suddenly, why? Britain has always thrown its lot with Pakistan, based on an  idea of martial races that appealed to the racist core of the UK. Bombed spectacularly for you, didnt it? Now, lick Indian boots and make up for that. Economics rules, and it makes sense to be nice and polite to India, doesnt it? And who told you Britain has an independent stake in the security situation? America makes all those decisions for you... lol at you poodles and your illusions.

:::::: Compliments are part of diplomacy: Churchill also flattered Nehru when he called him 'the light of the east'. That's why platitudinous press releases don't make very useful references. You're also confusing diplomacy with trade, which involves the exchange of goods and services, not compliments, which are largely immaterial to economic-decision making, except perhaps in underdeveloped countries like India where corruption is endemic, e.g. the IPL scam and Commonwealth Games fiasco. Pakistan is more important to Britain because of the size of its Pakistani community and its terrorism links. 

:::::: It appears that you have no understanding of international relations, and no constructive contributions to make, and that you're only here to distract editors by posting silly inflammatory comments. You've been causing a major distraction, and if you keep drawing attention to yourself like this, you'll inevitably get yourself blocked again, just like you did with your last suspected sock puppet.

::::: Ya ya...go with Pakistan, who is stopping you... oh it could be that TATA is now Britain's top industrial employer? Btw, I hope you remember how Obama threw the bust of Churchill out of the Oval Office. Wonder why he didn't use flattery in diplomacy...lol! Now go line up outside the new Tata factory in Wolverhampton for a job. Compliments and best wishes from an underdeveloped country that doesn't matter to the world economy. Oh...and enjoy our $10 billion donation to the IMF to save your EU. And send our compliments to your masters in the US.

:Technically India has some of the trappings of a great nation - it's a member of the BRICS and BASIC, the G-20 (alongside other emerging economies like Brazil) and the G8+5 whilst also languishing in poverty. I think that's why it's considered a middle power in some literature and an emerging great power in others - it's got some influence on the world stage, but not the right ability to project that influence if it needs to. Like Australia - big economy (comparatively) and a level of influence globally (less than India's, perhaps), teeny-tiny population which can't really project influence around the world. Technically there are small powers, but those are countries that have a severely limited role in global affairs (like New Zealand - tiny population, small-ish economy - probably how the like it too (: ) [[User:Comic master|Comics]] ([[User talk:Comic master|talk]]) 05:20, 22 October 2011 (UTC)

::The idea of India as a middle power is well attested in the literature. It's even part of the Nehruvian philosophical tradition. India has been talked up vaguely in some quarters as an "emerging" power since the seventies. As the saying goes, "India is always emerging, but never arrives". Makeshift claims based on membership of economic organisations or the mere size of domestic product aren't traditional or sufficient criteria; rather, they're expedient improvisations, a form of political rhetoric. Redefining a term to support an argument is a fallacy of equivocation. Every nation has aspirations, and we can always indulge in frivolous speculation, though, as you know, an encyclopaedia isn't really the place for personal POV-pushing.

::: Show me one reference in last 5 years that says Indian power is comparable to Denmark or Norway or Chile or Finland or Malaysia or Poland or Switzerland or Morocco or Romania or Sweden or Venezuela or Austria. I dont know how anyone can seriously believe that India is part of this club. Show me one academic reference that says Indian economy or military is in any sense in the same club as Finland.  As a special aside for you Lachrie, I must say British aspirations now by far outstrip its capabilities. You will need a lot more than your current 47 Typhoons to match those aspirations.

:::I know, but they were only makeshift claims. I wasn't suggesting we change the article to suggest a middle power had to have representation in x number of economic forums haha, I was just using them as examples of how India isn't considered a minor power.

::::"India's GDP of 1.7 trillion (please correct your figures)"  well;
*IMF est. India $1.6 trillion
*World Bank est. India $1.7 trillion
*CIA est. India $1.5 trillion

Take your pick, IMF is more reliable tho![[User:Lawardsday|Lawardsday]] ([[User talk:Lawardsday|talk]]) 16:02, 23 October 2011 (UTC)

== Add Colombia to the list ==

Colombia is considered a middle power and is seen as such by all spanish speaking countries, it has carried military operations in several countries, it has military units deployed in several parts of the world in peace keeping missions and have been in several international wars including the Korean war, the War in Afganistan and a war against Peru. Its part of the UN security council also.

Economically it plays a important role in south american economy.

It has one of the highest economies in the region.
