== Confusing example ==
Where you say, using the example of "all ravens are black birds", I think that this is a little confusing, if you think about it--which I'm sure you're hoping your readers will--for what is the point of writing something that nobody thinks about)because surely the nominal part of the sentence black birds in the semantic interpreation that the author is trying to get across is that the color is important, that is the focus, is it not? The blackness of the bird, is it not? '''This is not correct please see logic page for better definition''' The thing that is confusing is that there is a category of bird that is called a black bird not talking about the color but focusing on a category or taxinomy of a particular bird which obviously was named such because it is black but that is not the point. You wouldn't say all ravens are red hens or even chickens because in fact hen is only the female variety but I hope you get what I mean. It is in fact, is it not?, redundant (redundant language use) to say bird at the end because surely all people know that a raven is a type/category/taxonomy of bird so I think that the examlple here should go all "ravens are black". I think this is more acurate and will prevent possible misunderstanding which we don't want surely. I hope you don't think I'm just being hopelessly pedantic but accuracy is, is it not by connotation pedantic?

It's only just occurred to me that perhaps the use of raven and blackbird is actually quite semantically similar is it not? That would or possibly could make the argument tautological, could it not?

Therefore the picture is above the floor. 

Actually, this example is deductively invalid. An analogous argument is: Bert is Alf's father, Alf is my father, therefore Bert is my father. But (as you may have figured out already) Bert is ''not'' my father, but my grandfather. The author of this example probably had an implicit premiss in mind, namely, 'that the relation 'A is above B' is a [[transitive relation]]'. The addition of this premiss would make the argument deductively valid.

[[User:Oranfry|Oranfry]] 23:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
I don't think that your analogy is a good one and fail to see that it proves your claim that the picture is above the floor example above is invalid.   The conclusion of your example would correctly be  Bert is my father's father.  And the earlier example would be  The picture is above the dest that is above the floor, which, since it is governed by physical laws, translates into The picture is above the floor.

:Indeed the problem is, there is an implicit argument, namely: that the physical laws hold - or more precisely: that the relation 'is above' is the 'has a greater z-coordinate in a specific system governed by physical laws', which premiss is not explicitly stated.

== Out of the blue ==

The section "Example" suddenly, without any warning, transition or anything, erupts into a table headed "Basic argument forms of the calculus". There has been no previous mention of any notion of calculus. In the table we find strange unexplained symbols, like → ∧ ⊢ ¬ ∨ ↔ . This is totally incomprehensible, except for people who don't need to read this article because they know this stuff already. From the point of view of logic, it is not clear why this formalization is given in preference over others. --[[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]][[User talk:Lambiam|<small><sup>Talk</sup></small>]] 20:26, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

I agree that this article is poor relative to the one on inductive reasoning.  I think the problem lies in the tautology of the very first sentence of the article, whereby the concept of deduction is employed to define the concept of deduction.  We need to step back somehow and start over with a new opening sentence.  One that doesn't verge on circularity.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/67.193.206.183|67.193.206.183]] ([[User talk:67.193.206.183|talk]]) 02:55, 10 October 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Invalid Example? ==

In the section entitled "Popular misuses of the term" it says:

"There are deductively valid arguments that proceed from the particular to the general (Oscar is grouchy, therefore something is grouchy) and inductive arguments that proceed from the general to the particular (all Rice University students are smart, therefore this particular Rice University student is smart)."

Wouldn't that second example be correct?
ALL students are smart. Therefore ONE student (who is included in the previous ALL) is smart. I don't understand how you can disprove the conclusion without firstly disproving the hypothesis?

== Gravitation to illustrate induction and deduction ==

Beyond the factual question of who discovered Neptune (see [[Neptune#Discovery]]), I have a concern about using gravitation as an example.  On the one hand, the discovery of Neptune is one of the greatest historical instances of deductive reasoning.  On the other hand, I believe Newton described his own discovery of the universal law of gravitation as a deduction.  There is a famous geometrical diagram, made by Newton, to show how he deduced his law of gravitation from [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].  Kepler's laws would be a genuine induction.  Of course, many people hold up Newton's law of gravitation as an induction.  I think there is simply a lot of confusion on the matter--both semantic confusion about the terminology (people using multiple, conflicting terminologies) and substantive confusion about the historical facts.

Maybe the solution is simply to omit discussion of inductive reasoning here, since that's the only part that's questionable, and anyway, this article is about deductive reasoning, not inductive.  I ''would'' like to see a great, non-controversial example of a deduction that "cashes in" on an induction, though.

[[User:BenKovitz|Ben Kovitz]] 23:22, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

:Newton wasn't using a modern dictionary. Definitions change. Anyway, I see your point about leaving inductive reasoning out, but every book I have which discusses one contrasts it to the other. If we don't go ahead and find a way to compare them clearly and logically, somebody else will come along later and insert a poor comparison. I think it's better to keep working on it to get it right now. [[User:Wryspy|Wryspy]] 17:54, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

:: I agree.  I'll go through my traditional logic books, percolate on a way to illustrate the concepts, and post another attempt, and then see what you and others think. Regarding Newton, I believe he actually ''did'' deduce his law of gravitation from Kepler's laws, by the ordinary meaning of "deduce". The facts of this case are not what people expect, I think. Perhaps Kepler's induction and Newton's deduction are the wonderful illustration we're looking for (though a bit esoteric and possibly [[WP:OR]]). --[[User:BenKovitz|Ben Kovitz]] 19:04, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

== "Inductive Reasoning Example of Apples and the Theory of Gravity" ==
* An example of deduction given in the article:
: "By thinking about phenomena such as how apples fall and how the planets move, Isaac Newton deduced his theory of gravity."
But this appears to be induction according to the definition given earlier in the article:
: "Inductive reasoning starts with a particular observation that is believed to be a demonstrative model for a truth or principal that is assumed to apply generally"
That is Newton used the specific example of the falling apple to induce the theory of gravity.

I agree.  In ''By thinking about phenomena such as how apples fall and how the planets move, Isaac Newton '''deduced''' his theory of gravity. In the 19th century, Adams and LeVerrier applied Newton's theory (general principle) to '''induce''' the existence, mass, position, and orbit of Neptune (specific conclusions) from perturbations in the observed orbit of Uranus (specific data).'' it would appear that the words boldened have been inerchanged, perhaps as a joke.

== Grammar ==

:''Alternative to deductive reasoning is inductive reasoning. The basic difference between the two can be summarized in the deductive dynamic of logically progressing from general evidence to a particular truth or conclusion; whereas with induction the logical dynamic is precisely the reverse.''

The aforementioned statements include a clause masquerading as a sentence: "basic difference between the two can be summarized in the deductive dynamic of logically progressing from general evidence to a particular truth or conclusion."  Secondly, a semicolon is supposed to be used to attach two strings of words that are related but could independantly exist as sentences in their own right.  The string of words appearing after the semicolon: "whereas with induction the logical dynamic is precisely the reverse," could not be a sentence.

Next, with those laws, one can make predictions about what will happen in other specific instances.

== A few notes. ==

Greetings,

I have rewritten the sentences in the opening paragraph. The opening sentences are much more lean and easy to follow.

A few comments:

1. I believe the phrase 'the truth of the conclusion' and 'the truth of the premises' is unnecessary clutter. Either something is true or not. Saying 'the truth of the conclusion' makes little sense. Instead, just say 'conclusion' or 'premise'.

2. Saying that 'an argument is said to be deductive' is also clutter. 'An argument is deductive' conveys the same message. Said to be by whom, anyway?

3. "Note, for example, that the conclusion of the following argument would have to be true if the premises were true, (even though they are, in fact, false)" This sentence is unabashedly horrible. It appears to make sense at first glance, until you read it again. I replaced it with, 'This is an example of a valid argument. The first    premise is impossible, yet the conclusion is still true.' I think that's what the original author meant, but if not please fix it.

4. "In logic, an argument is said to be deductive when the truth of the conclusion is purported to necessarily follow from or be a logical consequence of the truth of the premises and (consequently) its corresponding conditional is a necessary truth". 

Compare this with 

"In logic, an argument is deductive when its conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises."

A better Logician than I can see if any value has been lost in that sentence. I couldn't.

The rest of my changes are minor, mostly made to improve the flow and rhythm of the words.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/118.210.6.70|118.210.6.70]] ([[User talk:118.210.6.70|talk]]) 08:49, 10 March 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Induction as "bottom-up logic" ==

Would it be possible to change the text "(bottom-up logic)" on the deductive reasoning page to the more accurate "(bottom-up logic, although this is an old-timey term which may confuse you endlessly as there is no consensus regarding whether or not this is an appropriate view--good luck)"?

== I've found a mistake in the article, but I don't yet have the knowledge needed to fix it ==

I'm teaching myself mathematics and logic these days, and when reading the article, I saw the following erroneous sentence in the article's intro:

"In inductive reasoning, the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from, i.e., there is epistemic uncertainty."

Extrapolating from what? I would like to take a crack at fixing this error, but seeing as I am a beginner in the field, I thought I would notify someone with experience rather than just taking a guess and risk using the wrong phrasing or whatever.

== Status of proof by exhaustion ==

What status has the [[proof by exhaustion]] in regards with deductive reasoning? Can it be included to deductive reasoning like [[mathematical induction]]?--[[Special:Contributions/5.2.200.163|5.2.200.163]] ([[User talk:5.2.200.163|talk]]) 16:31, 23 January 2018 (UTC)
