== Age of the US Constitution ==

The age of the Constitution has not been changed in two years.  Currently the article says that it is 229 years old but as of September 2018 it will be 231.  Could this be edited please?  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/12.38.31.244|12.38.31.244]] ([[User talk:12.38.31.244#top|talk]]) 14:01, 4 April 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:You're thinking that the "age" of the constitution should be from the time the document was signed, but the article considers its age from when it came into effect. The template used for the <code>date_effective</code> infobox parameter reads <code><nowiki>{{Age|1789|03|04}}</nowiki></code>. The article consistently says the constitution "came into force in 1789". [[User:Dhtwiki|Dhtwiki]] ([[User talk:Dhtwiki|talk]]) 21:55, 4 April 2018 (UTC)

=="The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States"==
If you would take a look at [[Balzac v. Porto Rico]] you would see that the full United States Constitution is only applicable to the portions of the United States that have been [[Incorporation|incorporated]] into the Union and not the Nation as whole. Should the wording of this article be modified to reflect that? My suggestion would be to change it to the "supreme law of the incorporated United States". But, of course I'm sure others have better ideas. -- [[User:Endercase|Endercase]] ([[User talk:Endercase|talk]]) 16:28, 7 May 2018 (UTC)
Does no one else have any thoughts on this? [[User:Endercase|Endercase]] ([[User talk:Endercase|talk]]) 19:47, 8 September 2018 (UTC)

:We have a constitutional scholar for the reference “The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.”  To change that, you would want to find another scholar who says “…the supreme law of the incorporated United States”, rather than asserting your own personal interpretive authority as a point of view (WP:POV) for applying the Balzac case to the states and territories, incorporated and unincorporated. Then we might have a further discussion as to which author represents the preponderance of scholarship on the matter. 

:We live in a federal system, which the Supreme Court has held, does allow incorporated and unincorporated territories within the United States under the Constitution, requiring the implementation of the Constitution's "fundamental rights" everywhere. In an op-ed in the Washington Post by [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/08/12/does-the-seventh-amendment-civil-jury-trial-right-apply-to-the-states-and-to-puerto-rico/?utm_term=.54e3c514d917| Eugene Volokh, August 12, 2014], the author cited a professor Suja Thomas at the University of Illinois College of Law saying a federal judge had ruled that the Seventh Amendment civil jury right is a "fundamental right" and it applies to Puerto Rico, whether as an incorporated or unincorporated territory. 

:Relative to jury trial, which was the subject of Balzac v. Porto Rico, federal courts for unincorporated territories require juries, and Puerto Rico requires juries for criminal trials. Puerto Rico does not necessarily require juries for civil cases. For small claims cases, neither states nor territories usually require juries. So, the short answer seems to be, the U.S. article introduction should not change its first sentence, unless you find a compelling array of scholarship to the contrary.

"When did the Constitution go into effect?

The Constitution did not go into effect the moment it was signed by the delegates. It needed to be approved by the people through the ratification process. Article VII of the Constitution established the process for ratification, by simply stating that. “The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.” On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify;  and the Confederation Congress established March 4, 1789, as the date to begin operating a new government under the Constitution."

== Articles on individual amendments ==
=== Naming ===
Some of the current amendment articles are now actually quite good, such as[[United States Constitution/Amendment Twelve]]. However, I think we should get rid of the subpages. However, there are some options for the new name, and I don't know which one is the best:
# [[Amendment Twelve of the United States Constitution]]
# [[Amendment 12 of the United States Constitution]]
# [[Twelfth Amendment of the United States Constitution]]
# [[12th Amendment of the United States Constitution]]

Any suggestions? [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]]
:The more famous ammendments should simply be at [[First Amendment]], [[Twelfth Amendment]] and the like, unless there is ''any'' need to disambiguate, in which case I'd go with the third format above: [[Twelfth Amendment of the United States Constitution]]. (I came here just to say that the subpages should be renamed, so I'm glad someone's already raised it :) -- [[User:Sam Francis|Sam]]
::''Of'' doesn't sound right to me.  I vote for [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[User:Tokerboy|Tokerboy]]

IMO option 3 is best for all. "[[First Amendment]]" and other famous ones, could redirect to the longer titles. But each one should be named using the same convention in order to reduce confusion lest somebody erroneously links to a not-so-famous Amendment via the shortened syntax. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:I agree "to" is even better. --mav

== Problem with editing 12th Amend. &sect; ==
In the process of making this (IMHO, ill-advised) change, some original explanatory text from the 12th amendement article was removed.  Additionally, links are being redirected to this general, and less useful page.  For example, if someone is specifically interested in the 12th amendment, they are now redirected to the U.S. Constitution page, whereas before, they actually got the 12th amendment and historical context.  sigh.

Here's the text, in hopes that someone figures out how to integrate it.

:This amendment was motivated by the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|Presidential election of 1800]].  Prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, votes for President and Vice President were not listed on separate ballots.  [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his running mate [[Aaron Burr]] tied in the number of electoral votes received, neither receiving a majority of votes.  The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted over thirty times to a tie vote before a deal was struck and Jefferson was elected.

:The amendment itself was a subject of a constitutional dilemma.  On [[June 15]], [[1804]], the amendment received the constitutionally-required ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures when [[New Hampshire]] ratified the amendment.  However, on [[June 20]], the Governor of the state vetoed the amendment.  Since the Constitution doesn't mention anything about governors, it's questionable whether their veto matters.  The issues was resolved when [[Tennessee]] ratified the amendment on [[July 27]], [[1804]].

== Original texts on Wikipedia ==
I note that [[Constitution of Canada]] has gone on the chopping block due to it being just a source text ported over to Wikipedia. I agree with this verdict, I've campaigned vociferously against source texts myself in other places. However, as a good red-blooded Canadian, I feel it is my duty to put [[United States Constitution]] up for the same treatment. Fair's fair, after all. :) Since this page gets linked to more frequently, though, I don't want to just go in and clear out great swaths without warning or consultation. Anyone have any comments or suggestions before I convert the US constitution to external links? [[user:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen]], Friday, June 14, 2002
:Go for it. [[user:Vicki Rosenzweig|Vicki Rosenzweig]], Saturday, June 22, 2002

:I strongly disagree.  If it's put into the Wiki in such a way that context can be added, then it's a good thing to have the source text as well (note, for example, the [[United States Constitution/Amendment Twelve|Twelfth Amendment]] article).  I also think the Canadian Constitution should be in Wikipedia as well.  Any decent encyclopedia includes the full text of at least the U.S Constitution.  [[user:RobLa|RobLa]], Saturday, June 22, 2002
:: The problem--other than the imbalance of chopping the Canadian constitution but keeping the US--is that *everything* here can be edited. That makes the Wikipedia a poor location for any source text--someone looking up the text of the US constitution needs to know that they're going to see the precise document, not something someone fiddled with because the commas in the Second Amendment don't work by 21st century standards, or something with a line missing because someone got careless. Or, worse, someone decided they disagreed with the people who wrote the thing, and took it on themselves to leave here what they think our constitution should be. [[user:Vicki Rosenzweig|Vicki Rosenzweig]], Saturday, June 22, 2002
:::I also concur -- source texts like these are useless unless the reader can be reasonably sure that what is on the screen is actually what the original authors wrote. Small selections that are commented on are fine entire documents are most certainly not appropriate -- this is ''especially'' important with legal documents. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that tollerates some almanac-type list information, it is ''not'' a library. Rob, please see [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] number 12 and also some comments at [[talk:Macbeth]]. --[[user:maveric149|maveric149]]

Cunctator has developed some ideas on separate project to handle the wikification of source texts, and I added a few thoughts. If anyone's interested, check out [[m:Project Sourceberg]] (his name, not mine ;-) over at the meta. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]
:No need for to go through the trouble of having a separate project. What is needed is separate namespace that has special default properties -- such as only being able to be edited by "trusted hand" or greater users and be able to be called upon by other articles with the following or similar syntax:  <nowiki>[[source:Origin of Species/Chapter 1{1-15}]</nowiki> (where "1-15" are line numbers) and also serve as stand-alone wikified texts. Of course, there would have to be strongly enforced policies to only correct OCR errors and to wikify the text. See my idea at [[wikipedia:feature requests]]. --[[user:maveric149|maveric149]]

Personaly, I (and others, based on comments on the Sourceberg page) don't think that primary sources are well suited for permanent wiki life. Once they are corrected and linked to articles, there's not need to keep them in an editable state. Also, I think it's important to for the Wikipedia project to remain focused on producing encyclopedia articles. Inputing, correcting, and linking source texts, while very interesting and useful, doesn't fall under that mandate. I think, if enough people are interested, that the wikification of sources is best left to a closely related but separate sister project. --[[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]]

:jheijmans, the amendments are of enough historical signicance to have their own pages.  Whether or not the source text is quoted on them is less of a concern (they are short enough that it doesn't do harm), but they all have histories associated with them.  As you can see from this long talk thread, I was pretty upset to see the amendments get redirected, and was quite relieved to see Cunctator's action. -- [[user:RobLa|RobLa]]

:: Maybe the US constitution is interesting enough for an encyclopedia article, but who guarantees the page is not edited here at Wikipedia? Just because the constitution is not copyrighted, there's no need to paste it in.

I will restore the redirect version when I have the time for it. [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]] 11:19 Aug 10, 2002 (PDT)

:You aren't getting it, are you?  There is ''no'' justification for having an article about the 12th amendment redirect back to a general page about the constitution.  None.

::How about if I remove the text from each amendment page, leaving a link to http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/constitution/constitution_transcription.html and a stub describing the basic gist of the amendment's content?

[[User:Bryan Derksen|Bryan Derksen]] 16:36 Aug 10, 2002 (PDT)

:::That's better.  As I said before, my biggest beef was with nuking the separate articles.  That said, I think it's humorous that people think hyperlinks to external sites are more reliable than source text.  Other websites change their URL structure <i>all of the time</i>.  Heck, the recent change from nara.gov to archives.gov broke all of the constitution links. I think it's blind orthodoxy to have a black and white policy prohibiting source text.  -- [[user:RobLa|RobLa]]

:Hey, I want the text there. It's not like it's a burden, and it's very useful. And I dare you to find a paper encyclopedia that doesn't include any excerpts from major documents. --[[User:The Cunctator|The Cunctator]]

I also thing there should be a dictionary section. Maybe links like this for defenitions: [[WikiDictionary\abnormal]].

But no one ever likes my opinons or idea so its prob a wate of my time wrting this . - fonzy.

Cunctator and RobLa: an encyclopedia is to look up information ABOUT various subjects. If I look up the [[Bible]], I don't expect to find a verbatim copy of the text there. I want to know what signficance the book has, who wrote it, why it is so important. Such a discussion may use some quotes from the book itself, though they would need to be explained. If I would simply get the full text instead, I'd probably go away to some other encyclopedia instead. The same for the (US) constitution. If I wanted to read the full text, I'd probably search for it specifically and not bother to look it up in an encyclopedia anyway. In stead, I expect to find something about the history, the significance etc. of the US constitution. And yes, even the individual articles or amendments may be of interest (f.e. the gun-bearing amendment). And in some cases, if the text is short, that could even include a full copy of the text while remaining interesting, such as the [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan]] article. So, if you have something to write about the constitution, please do, but do a little more than just the plain text. [[User:Jheijmans|Jeronimo]] 12:29 Aug 11, 2002 (PDT)

== Section on impeachment ==

Re: RickK
According to Article 1, Section 5, it requires a two-thirds vote to "expel" a member of either house of Congress. That vote is taken within that house. Since expulsion and impeachment are two different things, I removed the reference to the impeachment of a senator. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=United_States_Constitution&diff=0&oldid=2922660]. The number of impeached officials as shown in the edited paragraph is what is disputed.

== Bill of Rights Joke? ==
Someone placed this in the section about the bill of rights.  I italicized the text in question.  I won't delete it, though.  Someone should notice this.  If not, then it proves that theory about the quantity over quality arguement against Wikipedia.  I hope someone removes it.

Originally, the Bill of Rights was not intended to apply to the states; for instance, some states in the early years of the nation officially established a religion. This interpretation of these Amendments remained until 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, which stated, in part, that:

''I'm so caught up got me feelin it caught i dont know what it is, but this girl she got me twisted im so caught up got me feelin it caught up im losin control this girls got a hold on me''

EDIT: This must have been a problem with my browser.  Why did I see this.  Then, after viewing the page again, it was replaced with:

''No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.''

== Hemp ==
Isn't the physical document a piece of hemp paper? If this is in fact true then I would like to see it mentioned in the article here.

:No, it isn't.  The Constitution is written on parchment.  This is treated animal skin, typically sheepskin. [[User:Steve802|Steve802]]

Actually the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, let alone a lot of clothing and paper from earlier generations prior to the 1930's was made of Hemp.  Hemp (English word) was a major product of the colonies in fact, whereas it was illegal not to grow it at one time.  During the 1930's a campaign was conducted by the Hearst Corporation to label Hemp as the 'devil weed' and they picked the Spanish word Marijuana(sic) to demonize this hearty and very versitle plant.

== On the description of the 13th amendment ==
On the description of the 13th amendment:

It appears to me that the text "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted" can equally well be taken to refer to "slavery and involuntary servitude" '''and''' to "involuntary servitude" alone. Historically this exception appears to have been used in order to allow prison work, which surely falls under the rubric of "involuntary servitude" rather than slavery. Moreover, the Supreme Court has established many times that the amendment "abolishes slavery" in no uncertain terms. Some of the quotes are here: http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/constitution/amdt13.html
Therefore, I think it justified to simply say that the amendment abolishes slavery.

I don't understand exactly what alternative is being referred to in article 5 in the following text from the top of the section on Unratified Amendments:
"Backers of some amendments have attempted the alternative, and thus far never-utilized, method mentioned in Article Five. In two instances—reapportionment in the 1960s and a balanced federal budget during the 1970s and 1980s—these attempts have come within just two state legislative "applications" of triggering that alternative method."[[User:Johnor|Johnor]] 10:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:I think it is referring to the process of constitutional amendment through [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].

*the second amendment is in fact interpreted as being an individual right by the SCOTUS and the meaning of ''militia'' and ''the people'' are no longer an issue (I know, the sentence in the current article is about the controversy, whether those gnashing their ignorance about it understand current case-law or not); and maybe I can slide in the famous phrase "an individual right but not an absolute one" as regards the determination of who may be excluded and what weapons are protected...I don't want to repeat everything at the Gun Politics article (hell, I don't even want to '''look''' at the Gun Politics article because I know I'm going to be disgusted at both sides' ignorance of the SC's rulings...), I just think these things are at least as important to mention as the asides already included in the article.

:::universal suffrage is more a modification of part of the framework of the republic, but you're correct in aim (more below). and yes, it's a fact that the founders did generally reject democracy (using precision in language there). i do not agree with your claim that the constitution "provided" (past tense) a way for the people to change government regularly (again using precision). however, your point of direct election of senators is valid; it did take the US toward democracy, as did the 16th amendment. if you would add that to the article with care (not ascribing democratic intent to the prior constitution), i support the mod. to answer your question, which i guess was perhaps a joke: yes, i believe GW Bush is a liar and a tyrant when he presumes for the sake of popularity with the ignorant that democracy is good, but i don't see that it matters much to an article about the constitution (other than a new section about its general ineffectiveness in preventing tyranny). on the subject at hand, i would welcome a tight reference in the article to democracy, but not one that attempts to roll previous republican aspects into what we have now. please keep it in historical context and objective, and i'm cool, as i hope most people would be. you're of course right that we do have a democracy now, but mostly because of the failure of the earlier version of the constitution, not its originally stated or historical intent.

:::::I agree with past comments, the constitution was not meant to set up a democracy. They purposely put the senate in and had senators elected by the state legislature to insulate the government from democracy and keep it elitist. Only a few of the "founding fathers" as they are called believed in democracy, most were at least partially opposed to it (if not completely opposed). While the constitution has become slightly more democratic, I think it is absurd to say the US was or is a democracy--republic maybe, but democracy, no.

===History===
''This government lacked, for example, any power to impose taxes as it had no method of enforcing payment. It could not even control commerce between the states, leading to a series of conflicting tax laws and tariffs between states.'' the word "even" indicates bias, implying certain minimum federal control of commerce on which all agree. the phrase "leading to" is not factual, and also shows bias. it could be changed to "allowing", but the entire sentence should be rewritten.

''Not only this, but the Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before any changes could take effect.'' "Not only this" is the language of somebody with an agenda -- argumentative. it has no place here.

''All this was criticized as far exceeding the convention's mandate, and being extralegal besides, but the paralysis of the Articles of Confederation government was evident and the Congress agreed to submit the proposal to the states despite the exceeded terms of reference.'' "but the paralysis of the Articles of Confederation government was evident"? to many it was not. the statement is biased, and simply a rewrite of history based on which side won (federalists). this and the statements mentioned above presume the correctness of the action that was taken. not objective, and not NPOV. far from offsetting, the following "after fierce fights over ratification in many of the states" is contradictory.

===Principles of government===
if the word "rights" is to refer both to natural rights and to allowances under the constitution, delineation would be helpful and accurate. i am including this as an NPOV dispute because there are many who explicitly presume that the constitution grants rights to the people when it does not. it's POV. the assertion that ''State actors acting in the name of the people have the right to change their form of national government by means defined in the Fifth Article of the Constitution itself'' implies that rights (not allowances) flow from the constitution. that is contradicted by the constitution (e.g., amendments 1, 2, 4, 9). a seemingly minor point to some, but it wasn't minor to the framers. their language tended toward precision on the matter.

Moreover, any two thirds of the states may themselves initiate a convention for proposing amendments. When ratified as specified, all amendments are considered part of the Constitution.

''This relatively small number is usually attributed to the simplicity and flexibility of the document: it is written in broad terms that are continually reinterpreted by the courts.'' should be modified so that it doesn't imply that all reinterpretation by the courts is over "broad terms". there is explicit language in the constitution that has been "reinterpreted" to mean something other than what it clearly says. some may argue that the statement i just made is non-NPOV; however, it's no more non-NPOV than the blanket "broad terms" assertion. the statement needs balance, if not simply accuracy.

'''to'''

This relatively small number is usually attributed to the simplicity and flexibility of the document, as much of it is written in broad terms. The Constitution is continually reinterpreted by the courts, and there is often dispute over these rulings. Some argue that judges cross from mere interpretation to rewriting, thereby bypassing the prescribed amendment process (see [[Judicial activism]]). Others counter that broad judicial interpretation is essential for the Constitution to remain relevant to changing times.

:not happy with this proposed change myself, and i expect there will be opposition. perhaps it might help to say that i was almost gagging when i wrote it! anyway, please give suggestions for improvement that at least cut down somewhat on the POV of the current version. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 03:37, 2005 May 29 (UTC)

::I don't think the subject of judicial activism really belongs in an analysis of the constitution. That's an article for another page. The flexibility of the document means that Congress has considerable latitude to legislate in light of new situations. (For example, using the interstate commerce clause to legislate telecommunications.)

::You might change the statement to something like: "This relatively small number is usually attributed to the simplicity and flexibility of the document. The Constituion gives Congress considerable freedom to create laws which deal with new situations not forseen by the Constitution's authors, subject to judicial review e.g., using the interstate commerce clause to create legislation regulating telecommunications."

::Most situations where the courts review the constitutionality of laws are not controversial and "broad judicial interpretation" ignored the justices who advocate a very narrow reading of the Constitution. Any attempt to include "judicial activism" (a spurious charge at best considering both sides levy it against each other) results in an injection of bias. Better to just discuss the flexibility to create new legislation and leave it at that. [[User:Kbrooks|Kbrooks]] 03:56, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)

:::thanks for the comments. i believe you're arguing for your personal bias here though. many people (the principal author of the constitution [http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm among them]) disagree that the constitution gives such "considerable freedom" as in your example of claiming that the commerce clause covers telecommunications. though i don't like my proposed change, it does cover two major opinions and doesn't claim either is correct. i don't have any problem not using the loaded term (or link) "judicial activism", but i also don't think it's true to state, as the article does now, that there's a blanket flexibility there. much of what the courts have ruled over the years violates the constitution directly (e.g., mccain-feingold, about which several supreme court justices said as much themselves), or at least takes it into territory which people such as james madison said explicitly is ''not'' flexible in the least. i don't agree with your claim that "Most situations where the courts review the constitutionality of laws are not controversial". do you have a suggestion which doesn't get into this territory in any way (rather than just one way)? the article as it stands on this subject is POV, showing only the "do what thou wilt" school of constitutional law -- a point of view. it is not wikipedia's concern what "both sides" do (not sure what that means); the article should discuss the constitution and how its followed or not. there seems to be a view in this country that whatever is allowed to be done ''must'' be constitutional. i hope that's not a view you want the article to hold. BTW, i am for removing this section if a balance can't be reached. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 04:54, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)

:: Actually, I'd say it's just better to leave the sentence out altogether. The issue--whether judicial interpretation affects the frequency of amendment--is only peripherally relevant to the issue of the Constitution's amendments, and is ultimately speculative. Wikipedia does not offer opinions--it only describes existing information. We should be skeptical of offering speculation like this. When we do provide it, it should be backed up with specific references, so readers know it is not just a contributor's opinion.

:: That being said, the issue of interpretation of the Constitution belongs elsewhere in the article. There should be an article describing the issue of "Strict Constructionism" vs. the "Living Constitution"; how the Constitution is interpreted very broadly ''in practice'' today, but how many criticize that practice.

:: I also think that the reference to "judicial activism" is POV. It puts too much emphasis on the judicial branch. In many cases&mdash;such as with the Second Amendment&mdash;the issue is whether the legislative or executive branches are going beyond the limits imposed by the Constitution. In cases like that, the critics are actually alleging "judicial passivism". [[User:Mateo SA|Mateo SA]] | [[User talk:Mateo SA|talk]] 05:09, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)

===The Bill of Rights (1–10)===
the section states fairly objectively that the supreme court has interpreted the 14th amendment "to extend some, but not all, parts of the Bill of Rights to the states." however, 2 paragraphs later, it states, "The ten amendments collectively known as the Bill of Rights remain as they were adopted two centuries ago." this is after the article asserts correctly, "Unlike most constitutions, amendments to the U.S. constitution are appended to the existing body of the text, rather than being revisions of or insertions into the main articles."

if there is no provision to revise the literal text of the constitution, then the statement that the first ten amendments "remain as they were adopted two centuries ago" is meaningless, and implies that the bill of rights has not been trammeled. considering that millions of US citizens disagree, especially lately, and considering that the article itself asserts explicitly that the 14th amendment and the supreme court changed the practical meaning of the bill of rights, the claim should be rewritten or stricken. it is not NPOV. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:38, 2005 May 12 (UTC)

it's often claimed, and the article does it as well, that the bill of rights wasn't "intended" to apply to the states. however, here is another internal contradiction of the article; it discusses guarantees for judicial matters which seem quite strongly to be mostly, if not entirely, state related. this is a contradiction practiced generally, but it shouldn't be ignored simply because most gloss over the problem; if the article is not going to address the contradiction, the previous claim that the bill of rights wasn't intended to apply to the states should be removed. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:38, 2005 May 12 (UTC) [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:38, 2005 May 12 (UTC)

:Huh?  The judicial matters could easily apply to Federal courts.  Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if the intent of the BOR to apply only to the Federal government were a matter of historical record.  In any case, I do know that that was the accepted judicial interpretation of their intent until the courts began applying them to the states after the 14th amendment.

::historical record of intent or not, the document contains no such general restrictions on applicability. the all-inclusive language of most of the BOR, combined with the supremacy clause, requires that all arguments on general inapplicability to the states go extra-constitutional. that's fine, but what the constitution itself says is at least ''as important'' for this article.

====proposed change====
Originally, the Bill of Rights was not intended to apply to the states; for instance, some states in the early years of the nation officially established a religion. This interpretation of these Amendments remained until [[1868]], when the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was passed, which stated, in part, that:

'''to'''

It is commonly understood that the Bill of Rights was not originally intended to apply to the states, though except where amendments refer specifically to the Federal Government or a branch thereof (as in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]], under which some states in the early years of the nation officially established a religion), there is no such delineation in the text itself. Nevertheless, a general interpretation of inapplicability to the states remained until [[1868]], when the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was passed, which stated, in part, that: [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 08:53, 2005 Jun 4 (UTC)

====first amendment====
''The first guarantees freedom of worship, speech, and press; the right of peaceful assembly; and the right to petition the government to correct wrongs. It also prohibits Congress from passing "any law respecting an establishment of religion"—making this amendment a battlefield in the late-20th century culture wars.'' the first amendment does not guarantee anything except that congress shall make no law regarding those matters (even there the "guarantee" failed). further, the paragraph is self-contradictory when it states that the first amendment "also prohibits Congress from passing" anything. the prohibition on congress is on congress alone, and it applies to ''everything'' listed in the first amendment. if the article is to discuss here 20th century interpretation by the courts, it needs to be labeled correctly. as written, it is not factual, and is a point of view. what is wrong with simply stating exactly what the first amendment says, even if in abridged form? as written, this part of the article is interpretation. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:38, 2005 May 12 (UTC)

:[[User:Mateo SA|Mateo SA]], i like much of your 1st amend changes, but i think it has a small interpretation problem in a different way now. new version: "The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] addresses the rights of [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]]; the right of peaceful assembly; and the [[right of petition]]. It also addresses [[freedom of religion]], both in terms of prohibiting government establishment of religion and protecting the right to free exercise of religion."

:it's good that you didn't try to cover everything. my only quibble is with the "prohibiting government establishment of religion" part. the amendment merely prohibits ''congress'' from making a law respecting it -- a point that's often ignored these days. seems a small tweak (one that avoids mentioning congress and government) could bring the entire thing into line with the actual text while also avoiding any potential POV claims for volatile territory. what do you think? [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 05:20, 2005 May 29 (UTC)

:: I've adjusted the relevant sentence to read as follows: "It also addresses freedom of religion, both in terms of prohibiting <ins>the</ins><del>government</del> establishment of religion and protecting the right to free exercise of religion." My intent in rewriting the paragraph was to provide a completely neutral description of the amendment&mdash;i.e., to describe the concepts it addresses, without adopting one particular POV regarding its interpretation and application. I prefer that it said something like "literally, the amendment prevents Congress from respecting the establishment, etc.; it has been applied and interpreted in the following ways: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." However, I'm not sure there is a way to describe all the issues surrounding the amendment in a way that's both neutral and succinct enough for this article. Perhaps we could try expanding the description a ''little'' more, while directing readers to see the [[First Amendment|main article on the First Amendment]] (though that article also needs work).

:::i think it's fine. i like the idea of keeping it very simple while also, when possible, avoiding simply quoting the constitution. that's a difficult task though, as we've seen. it may be that this section would be better as a direct quote, but with wikilinks. as it stands, however, it's improved. still, it's hard to say the same thing as the constitution in a different way without making it longer. anyway, i look forward to your future changes. it would be nice for the article eventually to offer avenues for the more considerate disagreements over the constitution -- linking to geekier articles both at wikipedia and outside. the first amendment, for example, is so simple and clear, yet it's one of the most over-invoked and least understood pieces of law in history. maybe wikipedia can help reduce that strange disconnect. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 05:27, 2005 May 30 (UTC)

====second amendment====
''The second guarantees the right to keep and bear arms to a well-regulated militia (well-regulated meaning fit for a purpose and militia meaning the body of citizens likely to be of service in defense of the state).'' this is not correct. it's an interpretation, and should be marked as such. there are many problems with this section (including the use of the word "guarantees", and the offered definition of "well-regulated"), but using the militia clause to restate militias as the primary subject of the amendment is POV. the language of the amendment is clear, in that the right is explicitly coupled to the people ("the right of the people to keep and bear Arms"). if this section is intending to state what some courts have held as the interpretation of the amendment, it must be clear what it's doing, otherwise it's POV and not factual.

here is an example rewrite which might bother some people, but which is accurate with regard to what the amendment says (not somebody's, or even my, interpretation): "The second amendment prohibits the infringement of the right of the people to keep and bear arms, and lists 'a well regulated Militia' as the reason."

uncomfortable? that's [http://www.constitution.org/cons/constitu.htm#bor4 what it says]! [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:38, 2005 May 12 (UTC)

:No, that is not what it says. The amendment says: ''A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' The amendment does not "list" the militia as the "reason" for the amendment; it simply places two statements side-by-side. Your proposed description interprets the amendment as much as the original description. [[User:Mateo SA|Mateo SA]] | [[User talk:Mateo SA|talk]] 01:29, May 13, 2005 (UTC)

::that's an absurd claim (for english speakers anyway), but you raise a great point: if the only thing that people can agree on is the literal text, put that as the only attempt to say what it says. it's short enough. i'm all for it. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 03:23, 2005 May 13 (UTC)

::: If it's an absurd claim, why do you feel the need to provide your own redefinition of the amendment? The English language is inherently imprecise (though maybe the "english" language is not). If a sentence (like the second amendment) has only one possible meaning, then no other sentence can stand in its place. Your interpretation of the amendment as listing a reason relies on assumptions about the context of the amendment and the intention of its authors. You assume that the drafters of the amendment intended the first part simply as an offhand remark on the purpose of the amendment, and that that part can consequently be ignored. If that is so, then the drafters were not very precise or careful in writing the second amendment&mdash;which would contradict your own assertion that the amendment is unambiguous. My problem is that you insist that the amendment has only one possible meaning: the one you prefer. [[User:Mateo SA|Mateo SA]] | [[User talk:Mateo SA|talk]] 05:16, May 15, 2005 (UTC)

::::i don't see how you get pretty much ''any'' of what you say &#8212; about the amendment, about what i wrote above, or your claim that there's only one precise construction under which a sentence may keep its meaning. i do love to argue about things like that (off the article talk pages), but not with people who imply that it's relevant or meaningful that i don't cap "english". relevant here is that i obviously ''don't'' "feel the need" to provide my interpretation of the amendment, as my edit to the article shows quite well. do you have a problem with that section now (in the article, not here)? my only problem with it is pre-existing material i kept in the interest of making as few changes as possible. i'll leave it, assuming no objection. remember, the issue here is the article, not our opinions on the second amendment, which will probably always disagree. i'm done editing the second amendment part if it's okay. please comment here, or make desired changes to the article directly. i take it from your assertions that we at least agree that the prior interpretation should not stand as it was (unmarked). thanks.

::::: I split the actual amendment text from the opening phrase to parallel the rest of the amendments in the bill of rights.  I think the amendment deserves coequal treatment, though it often doesn't get such treatment.  Personally, I don't really see a need to rehash the definition of any of the amendments, since most of them are worded pretty clearly (more clearly than this one); I'd rather see supporting text that discusses how the amendment has been interpreted by the various branches of the government, particularly the supreme court.  I don't honestly know of the second amendment being used in any supreme court cases, though.  [[User:Warren Dew|Warren Dew]] 14:24, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

===Subsequent amendments (11–27)===
====Sixteenth Amendment (1913)====
"Authorizes the income tax." should be changed to "Authorizes taxes on incomes." "the income tax" unnecessarily implies that phrase as we recognize it today, and also has the faint odor of a sequential conflict (cart before horse). using the language of the amendment is simple and precise, allowing for disputes without getting into it. a fine point, admitted, but there's nothing lost in making the change. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:39, 2005 May 12 (UTC)

====Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971)====
the text: "Establishes right of eighteen-year-olds to vote." the description for the nineteenth amendment is: "Ensures right of women to vote." the relevant language of the two amendments is identical, and presumes a pre-existing right. should be changed to "Ensures right of eighteen-year-olds to vote." (or similar, with the 19th and 26th in agreement) [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:39, 2005 May 12 (UTC)


I decided to [[wikipedia:be bold|be bold]] and make some clarifications to the descriptions in this section (inlcuding SaltyPig's suggestions above), which I hope are not too controversial (the 21st amendment situation in particular is a bit tricky because of the recent Supreme Court opinion that limits import restrictions).

[[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 20:31, 2005 May 14 (UTC)
:While I think there are some NPOV issues in the article, it is also quite clear that no article can be written without any point of view. In fact, wikipedia specifically follows a position of "neutral point of view", which does not imply that no arguments can be presented but that wikipedia won't take a position. With a document as often reinterpreted as the US constitution, it is particularly difficult to present the content without also covering some interpretations.
:So what I would suggest is this: put your proposed changes on this talk page, give it a day for comments, and, if there are no concerns, place them in the actual article. [[User:Sebmol|sebmol]] 21:16, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

BTW, i agree very much with what you say about NPOV; sometimes it's spoken of as an achievable thing, when it's more just an idealized target. still, i think there's room to straighten this article out a bit, especially in those first couple of statements. i already edited the 2nd amendment section, in case you hadn't seen that; it keeps interpretations, but only those so identified. covert interpretations presented as fact should be removed/edited when possible.

===proposed Democracy addition===
No form of the word [[Democracy|democracy]] is found in the Constitution. Some framers of the document argued (perhaps most notably in the [[Federalist Papers]], especially 10 and 51) that democracy in its pure form is a danger to liberty, and that the natural impulses of factions and majority should be dampened via a [[Republic|republican]] framework. Hence, for example, Senators were to be elected to 6-year terms by their respective state legislatures, and President and Vice President were to be chosen via 
"[[U.S. Electoral College|electors]]". This isolated these offices somewhat from transient public opinion. The three branches of the Federal Government were also thought to contribute a dampening effect, as they would naturally oppose and offset one another to a degree. The Constitution guarantees "to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government..."

Though not specified in the Constitution, voting in the U.S. was mostly limited to white, male landowners. Beginning with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth]] (ratified under duress in 1868), many amendments were added which brought the U.S. closer to a direct democracy: [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment fifteen]] prohibits denial or abridgement, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, of the right to vote. [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment sixteen]] gives Congress the power to tax incomes directly. [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment seventeen]] transfers the elective power for senators to the people of their respective states (from the state legislatures). [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment nineteen]] prohibits denial or abridgement, on account of sex, of the right to vote. [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment twenty-three]] allows for the participation of the District of Columbia in the election of President and Vice President. [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment twenty-four]] prohibits denial or abridgement, by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax, of the right to vote in elections for federal office. [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment twenty-six]] prohibits denial or abridgement, on account of age, of the right of those eighteen years of age or older to vote.

: This proposal is extraordinarily POV, and is logically inconsistent. It also contains a number of factual errors and misrepresentations.

: I should first point out the meanings of the words "democracy" and "republic" have shifted over time, both before and after the American Revolution. The Federalist Papers defined democracy as a system in which in the people (i.e., those permitted to vote) as a whole participate directly in government. They defined a republic as a system in which the government is run by representatives elected by the people, and in which there are various limitations on the power of government. In particular, they focused on republics as protecting the rights of political minorities against the majority. Modern definitions of "democracy", (e.g., [http://www.answers.com/topic/democracy?method=5]) however, simply define it as a category of government in which political power is in the hands of the people in general, rather than a select group. This definition includes both "direct" democracy and representative government. This proposal uses both of those meanings, shifting between them to make its arguments.

: The first paragraph of the proposal generally refers to the definitions used in the Federalist Papers. It focuses on the idea that government should be limited, and the principle of majority rule be balanced by the idea of minority rights. It is ''generally'' accurate. (It does ignore the basic discrepancy in the Federalist Papers: the writers argued for rule by the people, rather than a specific class, but limited the definition of the people to a narrowly defined group.)

: The second paragraph, however, shifts away from this definition, although it specifically uses the term "''direct'' democracy". It focuses on the types of people permitted to vote. This has nothing to do with the concept of representative vs. direct popular government. What does determining who is permitted to vote have to do with whether the voters participate directly or indirectly? This definition does have more to do the modern definition of democracy: government by the people as a whole, rather than a select group. But it directly contradicts the arguments of the first paragraph.

: Some specific logical inconsistencies:
:* The Fourteenth Amendment does nothing to shift government toward direct democracy. In fact, by protecting the rights of political minorities, it arguably moves the constitution more towards "republicanism". 
:* Why isn't the Thirteenth Amendment included in this definition? It expanded the types of people permitted to participate in government.
:* "The Constitution guarantees "to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government..."" - This is incorrect. The Constitution ''instructs'' the "United States" to guarantee "to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government...". (By the way, this is the only part of the constitution that uses any form of the word "republic"&mdash;and this only refers to state governments, not the federal government.)

::the reversion of this edit makes me wonder why i bothered posting anything here first. it was sitting here, complete with the issues you object to, while you were active at wikipedia and in the article. anyway, re your objections:

::extraordinarily POV? i think you're wrong on that and several of your claims (see below). argument? i wasn't trying to make an argument. what you wrote about changing definitions is true; how it relates to this section isn't clear to me though. widening the group of voters does relate to the "directness" of democracy. otherwise, one could argue that a monarchy is a really really really limited democracy. is it perhaps a subtle influence? yes. but bear in mind that no amendment listed in the section is purported to be a drastic move toward direct democracy. rather, they contribute. further, amendments 16 and 17 do take the US government cleanly toward a "directer" democracy.

::my reply to your bullets:

::*'''14th:''' the fourteenth amendment apparently penalized states that limited the voting of any 21+ aged male. it's a very weak aspect, and one reason why i didn't even go into it. still, i think that's the best starting point.
::*'''13th:''' not sure i agree with that, but don't object to it being added as the start of the move.
::*'''guarantee of republican form:''' i shared until recently your new opinion on the word "guarantee", but considering its similar use elsewhere in the article (including in edits ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Constitution&diff=14017775&oldid=14005938 by you]''), i defer to a plausible definition of the word: a stated assurance or promise. and no, the assertion that it "only refers to state governments" is incorrect. the constitution guarantees ''to'' the states a republican form of government. there is no specification that the republican form of government is only ''within'' the states. since the states are governed by the central government as well as themselves, it is logically a constraint on the federal government (that it must be republican), perhaps even more so than on states. FTR (in case you're implying it), i made no claim that the moves toward democracy violate the constitution itself; i don't believe it is technically possible for an amendment to violate the constitution (not sure about that though).

::reminder: it was not i who proposed adding a democracy section to the article. but now that it's composed, i do see value to its inclusion, even if in drastically shortened form from what i wrote. i'd appreciate it if you'd address these issues and edit accordingly. if you feel there should be no section specifically addressing the subject of democracy, then please state that flat out so we don't waste time arguing over points you don't want in the article anyway. thanks. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 16:57, 2005 Jun 6 (UTC)

: I apologize for not responding to this proposal sooner, but I was trying to think of a way to respond to it. I did not expect you to stick it into the article so quickly, without any favorable comments.

: A direct democracy is defined as a system in which the people directly participate in government. That is, the people gather together in a "town meeting," individuals make proposals, and the assembled people vote on the proposals. The central issue here is whether those permitted to vote govern directly, or indirectly, through representatives. The issue of who is permitted to vote at all is separate, and was not considered by the Federalist Papers. The Papers focused in particular on ancient Greek city-states as examples of "pure" democracies, putting them as perfect illustrations. The Greek democracies severely limited the types of people who were permitted to participate in the democracy (excluding women, slaves, etc.), but were still considered pure democracies by the writers of the Papers. 

: '''widening the group of voters''': "widening the group of voters does relate to the "directness" of democracy. otherwise, one could argue that a monarchy is a really really really limited democracy." Flipping your argument around, you must logically conclude that the perfect republic, one that is not at all democratic, is a monarchy. I.e., the wider the group of voters, the more the system moves toward direct democracy and away from republicanism; conversely, the narrower the group of voters, the more the system moves towards republicanism, and therefore the most republican government is one that has only one voter&mdash;a monarchy. The answer to this paradox is that the issue of who is allowed to vote is not a feature that distinguishes between republics and democracies, ''at least not using the definitions used in the Federalist papers and in your proposal.''

: '''The Sixteenth Amendment''': "amendments 16 and 17 do take the US government cleanly toward a "directer" democracy." (Did you mean ''clearly''?) How does the Sixteenth Amendment do that? What does an income tax have to do with whether people participate in government directly or indirectly?

: '''guarantee of republican form''': I am not referring to the defintion of the word guarantee. I am referring to the first 4 words of Article IV, Section 4: "''The United States shall'' guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government. The Constitution does not itself guarantee the Republican form of government&mdash;it tells the "United States" (which, in the Const., usually means the federal govt.) to do that. I am using the same "precision" that you have insisted on elsewhere. And to remind you of the current state of the article (as you have done to me before), I have since revised those changes that included the word "guarantee".

: <del>I think some mention of the concepts of democracy should be included in the article, but it should be far more logically thought out than this proposal.</del> I don't think that we need to discuss the concept of democracy right now. It is not directly relevant to the article, as it is a comment ''on'' the constitution, rather than a discussion of it.

::i don't think you'll find anywhere in the proposed section that i claim the US is a direct democracy. seems to be what you're implying.

::yes, i agree with your monarchy argument as long as you don't call it perfect republic. i would call it an extreme republic, and not necessarily desirable, though perhaps hardly less desirable than the current mess of US government. i think you're fixating on this direct democracy extreme. if one accepts that it's reasonable to put republicanism and direct democracy on two sides of a rough continuum (not mathematically, but generally), then i don't see that there's much to get hung up on in what i wrote. widening the group of voters moves more ''toward'' the direct democracy side. that's all i said, but you seem to have it that i'm making some wild claims. it wasn't that revolutionary.

::no, i did mean "cleanly", not "clearly". the 16th takes it there because direct taxation is a direct involvement in the government, in a way that indirect taxation, and sometimes even voting, can't approach. again, is it literal "direct democracy"? of course not. however, the taxation side is quite powerful, and can influence government in the same way as a vote. the aggregate loss of individual tax income (an option that some are choosing now) perhaps has ''more'' effect on government than voting (and should probably be used more than it is). i stand behind the inclusion of the 16th.<del> it's not a "logical" problem on my side.</del>

::on the guarantee part, thanks for that clarification. i see what you meant now. <del>well, keep that in mind when you refine the democracy section! LOL. i've done my part, though i hope you don't leave out entirely the framers on democracy (whatever form you want to call what they weighed in against), and how that affected the original and current versions of the constitution. it's relevant.</del> [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 18:34, 2005 Jun 6 (UTC)

::maybe somebody'll find the time/inclination to work this up. considering how much people yap about "democracy" these days, probably worth a mention here, at least with regard to why it's not mentioned at all in the constitution. i don't feel like running the gauntlet on it, considering the payoff.

Is US President entitled to submit legislative proposals to Congress ?
:Only members of Congress can introduce bills into Congress. But anyone can suggest or submit legislative proposals to those members. The President is not more or less entitled than anyone else. [[User:Mateo SA|Mateo SA]] | [[User talk:Mateo SA|talk]] 22:55, May 31, 2005 (UTC)
:That is correct, under Congressional rules only members actually submit proposed bills, but there are two points worth noting.  First, the "state of the union" clause in article 2 section 3 does give the President a unique position to propose legislation "He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient...". Second, in the modern budget process the President is required by law to submit an annual budget to Congress, though the actual appropriation measures are still proposed by members.

== Bill of rights ==

On the [[Bill_of_Rights_1689]] page it says:

"The (British) Bill of Rights 1689 is a predecessor of the United States Constitution"

Either this should be mentioned on the United States Constitution page, or it should be deleted from the [[Bill_of_Rights_1689]] page. I've added it to the constitution page for the moment, anyhow.

At the moment the article implies that the constitution was just dreamed up out of thin air, which simply isn't true. It is a collection of the best legal principles and rights from elsewhere. [[Magna Carta]] was also influential - that's one of the reason's it's on display next to the United States Constitution in the [[National_Archives_and_Records_Administration|National Archives]].

[[User:Rnt20|Rnt20]] 19:51, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:though i question the logic above ("Either this should be mentioned on the United States Constitution page, or it should be deleted from the [[Bill_of_Rights_1689]] page."), the problem is larger with regard to accuracy and support. "predecessor" can mean only that it came before. precedence doesn't necessarily mean influence. is it likely? maybe. still shouldn't be stated as fact here w/o better reference. mere similarity doesn't prove influence.

:anyway, your new version is improved. can you maybe find (and add) sources though to support that stated ties go beyond similarity? also, it might be good, if influence is substantiated, to say that a source influenced parts of, for example, the bill of rights, rather than the entire constitution. you did improve that aspect though. thanks. and good job zapping the "human rights" blah blah there; it's far removed from the US constitution.

== Page Moved ==

I feel it is incorrect for this page to be at United States Constituation, and not the constitution of the united states. The latter is how it is refered to in the document itself. A similar change has been made to Congress of the United States (from United States Congress). I know this new title is a little more wordy, but it is historically acurate. Afterall, this is an encyclopedia. 
The other articles that reference the constituion have to be moved as well.

For your reference I have included that actual text of the preamble.
''We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this '''Constitution for the United States of America'''.''
--'''[[User: Gpyoung|Gpyoung]]'''&nbsp;<sup>''[[User talk:Gpyoung|talk]]''</sup> 02:42, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

: Look carefully at the words you have bolded. They say "this Constitution '''for''' the United States of America". By your logic, the "correct" name for the article should be "Constitution for the United States of America". But the "official" name of the Constitution is not really relevant to naming this article. A major guideline for naming an article in Wikipedia is to use the most common name for the subject of the article, so that users of Wikipedia can find it easily. This also lets writers of other articles link to the article quickly, without the need for redirects. [[User:Mateo SA|Mateo SA]] | [[User talk:Mateo SA|talk]] 03:56, July 12, 2005 (UTC)

::the implicit claim that how a document refers to itself in its text must be what others call it is quite shaky. the original constitution had no title; a title was added later for printing. this location thing was discussed before, and arguments hashed over google counts for various titles. such research, however unscientific, shows that the current title is the most popular name. is that a clear reason to keep the current title? i'd say it's no less reason than arbitrary arguments to the contrary. the title to an article about a document is not less historical or encyclopedic if it uses a title other than one suggested by the document. the article should be called what the article is about. in other words, there are several options here. why not use the unique option that most people will naturally enter (i.e., ''not'' simply "[[[Constitution]]")? it should stay as it is.

== allegedly POV 10th amendment addition ==

y'know, i saw 71.48.140.120's edit last night and busted out laughing. it did appear so obviously to be POV. but then i stopped to really analyze it (more than just the knee-jerk thing), and was hit with a thought: what if we were talking objectively about, for example, the practical adherence to the constitution of some third-world country? i looked damned hard at the addition, and could not, apart from the obviously redundant and somewhat sloppy language, pin the typical POV label on it. i concede that i edited it somewhat as a joke, to see what others would do. however, i am beginning to see that what passes for NPOV at wikipedia is not always NPOV, but rather the popularly "acceptable" POV. apart from some mildly extravagant turns of phrase, most of what 71.48.140.120 wrote, in substance, is easily demonstrated to be fact, especially since the 10th amendment has few to no holes for the "interpretation" crowd to fly away with.

yes, i know that what he wrote will probably never stand here, but i ask those claiming to protect the article against POV if perhaps there's a bit of sticking heads in the sand in this regard. the obvious state of affairs in the US is that the 10th amendment is ''not'' followed &#8212; to an extreme, almost ludicrous extent. and yet, stating the obvious so abruptly makes people think that the declaration is violently wrong or inappropriate. the 10th amendment could not be more clear; it is an almost universal legal limit on federal power &#8212; a legal limit that is violated increasingly. i think there's significant POV in the practical wikipedia conclusion that we can never openly admit that the constitution is being violated routinely; it must always be danced around with only limited acknowledgement.

i hope everyone will take a look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Constitution&diff=20459873&oldid=20459787 the addition] and examine it objectively (i.e., not under the presumption that this country's government would never allow wholesale deviation from the constitution). eventually, an honest encyclopedia must deal with this elephant in the room. i am not proposing that the addition be kept as written, but i think it must be considered for the objective truth it does have. while wikipedia isn't a storehouse for raw truth, but rather a compendium of prior knowledge, the article should be no less strenuous than if we were writing about something less sacred. a factual balance for this article, in my opinion, is far away from the current version. it reads very much like a sacred cow. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 20:30, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:The argument is certainly an interesting one. From the outsider's view, it would seem that the US has evolved far more into a centralised form of government. To remain it would have to be almost entirely rewritten to use more moderate language. It would certainly need some examples of where the federal government has legislated on issues not assigned to it by the constitution ([[Defense of Marriage Act]] perhaps?). However discussion of it would probably be more appropriate on the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amendment's page]] where I note there is a section entitled '''Federalism controversy''' which covers this issue. Maybe we could make a mention of the discussion on this page however, something like:

:''The effect of the 10th amendement has been somewhat reduced since its passing, through the federal government withdrawing funding from states who do not legislate to support a national policy (eg the national speed limit or national drinking age) or legislating under the [[commerce clause]] if it can be shown that the issue in some way affects inter-state commerce. For a fuller discussion of this, see the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] page.''

:what do you think? [[User:MrWeeble|MrWeeble]] 22:10, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
::Much more encyclopedic and balanced tone, the examples help a lot, and it's more appropriately succinct since the issue is covered in more detail on the other page. My concern was only about the language being used to present the issue (combined with my being to lazy to attempt a re-write myself); nothing to do with trying to deny or whitewash the trend. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 22:44, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:::''Much more encyclopedic and balanced tone''

:::and that is exactly my complaint. what is being called "balanced" is simply the artificial skewing of an obvious truth so that it doesn't appear as bad as it really is. that's ''not'' balance! it's watering down. it's like saying that the world trade center was "somewhat damaged" on 9/11, then claiming that to say what really happened would be POV. i know you're just offering up an example, MrWeeble, but "somewhat reduced" is the sort of ameliorative, misleading language i'm talking about.

:::i didn't want my little speech to be mistaken as a call to improve merely this one section. i'm speaking more generally about most of the power-centric sections of the constitution. for example, another quite obvious encroachment and failure to follow the constitution is in the clear language of the 1st amendment. can anybody seriously allege that congress has made no law respecting blah blah blah? there should be nothing wrong with stating flat out in this article (or perhaps, as Niteowlneils and MrWeeble mentioned, in the amendment article) that the amendment is essentially toothless. this is a much bigger problem than just for the 10th, but the sample rewrite for the 10th highlights the weakness pretty well. frankly, i'm surprised more people aren't disgusted by the failure of the constitution to do what it claims to do. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 22:59, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

::::Probably the "somewhat" should be removed. My main objections are the colloquialisms and, um, sarcastic? tone in passages such as "...a hollow platitude on a piece of parchment, which has been turned on its nose." or "...dictates policies...by controlling the purse strings of disbursed federal funds...". While colorful, that seems more appropriate in an op-ed piece than an encyclopedia. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 23:47, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::no argument on the op-ed language style. [[User:SaltyPig|SaltyPig]] 23:56, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:I chose "somewhat" mainly because I am not a constitutional lawyer and don't know how much reduced the effect has been. I am assuming that as it is still in the constitution there must be ''some effect'' that I was unable to quantify. It was basicly a "[[weasel word]]" (Sorry). I was aiming more for a neutral introduction to lead to a full discussion on the main page. Aiming for the middle ground often leads to blandness. &lt;TANGENT&gt;There's actually a really good west wing episode kind of about this, how neither side (liberal or conservative) is able to end up with the supreme court appointments they want and always end up with bland moderates. Their solution is to appoint two justices at the same time. is this of any relevence? no. Just a recommendation for a good programme.&lt;/TANGENT&gt; maybe "much reduced" would be better (if we can back it up)?

== TONA ==

is there something in the water today? how did this paragraph become ripe for interminable screwing with suddenly? Mateo SA, if retrying a previously reversed edit by someone else, please at least explain yourself, in the summary or here. the twice-attempted insertion of a congressional permission clause with regard to "any Title of Nobility or Honour" is not correct, nor is it necessary to duplicate or attempt to paraphrase this entire amendment. we've seen from many tries before elsewhere in the article that attempts to paraphrase briefly are usually deficient. there's no need to convey every detail of the amendment here as long as what's included is correct of itself. it's entirely accurate to state that the amendment would have "ended the citizenship of any American accepting 'any Title of Nobility or Honour' from any foreign power." as the law is written, there's no exception for permission in that respect, and any mention of permission necessarily brings in the relevant clause for that part &#8212; then we're back to duplicating most or all of the amendment when all that's needed in this context is a brief and accurate bookmark for orientation. as i mentioned in an edit summary today, the link is right there is somebody wants to geek some amendment that is apparently not even part of the constitution.

== Duelling sources for Second Amendment ==

Over the past few days, there has been a small edit war going on over the exact text of the Second Amendment between [[User:O^O|O^O]] and myself.  The text that was originally in this article, and which I restored based on the [http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html National Archives] was this:

<blockquote>
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
</blockquote>

O^O had originally changed it to:

<blockquote>
A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
</blockquote>

(Note the differing capitalization and use of commas.)  After I referenced the National Archive, O^O changed it again, this time based on the [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/amdt2.html Government Printing Office]:

<blockquote>
A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.
</blockquote>

It would seem that we have duelling sources.  However, the National Archives site has two things going for it.  First, the National Archives are where the actual Constitution and Bill of Rights are stored; it seems hard to believe that they would muff the transcription of one of their crown jewels.  Moreover, the GPO isn't even consistent.  Their [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_documents&docid=f:hd096.pdf PDF version] of the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence, Pocket Edition agrees with the National Archives.

BTW, I would like to thank O^O for sourcing his punctuation variant.  I'm happy anytime I see someone being open to argument, and I hope, if he has other arguments for his preferred punctuation, that he will raise them here.

:Hello DLJessup.  Thanks for stepping forward and bringing your questions to the talk pages.  Without any discussion, we don't have any way of knowing what each other was thinking.

:I'm against using the National Archives as the primary source for the Second Amendment, and perhaps for other parts of the Constitution and Bill of Rights as well.  While I don't doubt that the National Archives took great care to transcribe the paper copies that they hold, the problem is that the scribe who wrote those copies took liberty with adding punctuation and capitalization that were not in the text passed by the legislature.

:The Journal of the House of Representatives contains multiple instances of the exact text of the Second Amendment, as it was passed by the Congress. [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llhj&fileName=001/llhj001.db&recNum=302 Pages 305] and [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llhj&fileName=001/llhj001.db&recNum=305 308] have correspondences from the States of New York and Maryland respectively, in which each state documents the text of the Bill of Rights that they have ratified.  Both the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=002/llac002.db&recNum=378 Annals of Congress] and the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsj&fileName=001/llsj001.db&recNum=93 Senate Journal] document the final version, as it was passed by the Congress.  Finally, the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=144 Statutes at Large], which is the ''official source'' for all acts of Congress, show the final version as it was passed.

:All of these above versions are the "single comma" version.  It was the "single comma" version that was passed by the House, passed by the Senate, was ratified by the States, and is cited by the official source.

:However, when house clerk William Lambert prepared the first parchment copy of the Bill of Rights, he made several small changes in punctuation, spelling, and capitalization.  It is this parchment copy that hangs in the National Archives.  Transcriptions that faithfully reproduce the text of this copy will also reproduce the errors in this copy.-[[User:O^O|O^O]]

:P.S. - An interesting exercise would be for someone to exhaustively compare the version passed to the version scribed, to see where else Lambert made changes. -[[User:O^O|O^O]]

Wow!  I learn something new every day.

I was going to suggest that somebody fix the copy on Wikisource, but I see you've already done that….

Don't be hasty.  The SCOTUS uses "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."  U.S. v.

== no legislative power ==
I removed the recent addition "thus predicating that no legislative power is to be wielded by the executive and judicial branches of the federal government".  It is sometimes argued that it is unconstitutional for the legislature to delegate legislative powers to another branch, and because of the use of the word "wielded", I thought this sentence came close to making this argument.

:The Constitution was written specifically with a "non-delegation doctrine" as explained more fully in the [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Congress|Article One annotation]].

:::::There is no better source than the document itself.  In fact, nobody seems to have any viable information about meaning of the Constitution other than the actual document.  Luckily, the parts of the Constitution relevant to your question are written as clearly as any document could be.  "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress."  The Constitution simply doesn't grant legislative power to any other body.  Can federal power come from any other source?  Can the legislative branch, as you suggest, grant legislative power?  Amendment ten of the Bill of Rights says, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."  That doesn't leave any wiggle room.  The federal government simply doesn't have any power except that which is granted by the Constitution, and the Constitution does not give Congress the power to delegate legislative power to another branch.  Those founding fathers were on top of their game, wouldn't you say?  They saw us coming a mile away and covered all the bases.

::The separation of legislative power is the first and most important thing that the Constitution establishes.  Yet you have stripped everything about the separation of power from the overview of Article One.  

:::"'''All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'''"
::The Supreme Court did not claim any other "interpretation" of that sentence.  It would be ridiculous for them to have tried to say that the words were ambiguous or could possibly mean anything else.  Instead, the Supreme Court ruled that "ever changing and more technical problems" required "an ability to delegate power under broad general directives."  That ruling does not change the Constitution.  The words of the Constitution stayed exactly the same.  A 1989 ruling could not possibly be an "interpretation,"  nor does it claim to be.  What are they going to say?  That nobody understood the ''real'' meaning of the Constitution for the last 202 years?  That the members of Congress who drafted the Constitution didn't "interpret" their own words correctly in the 1700s?  That it took the Supreme Court a couple of centuries to decipher that the Constitution was really talking about an "intelligible principle?"  Give the Supreme Court a little credit.  They are not so stupid that they would call their 1989 ruling an interpretation of the Constitution, and neither should you.

::Mistretta v. United States is not an "interpretation" of the Constitution, nor does it claim to be, nor does it change the Constitution.  The overview of Article One is not about a 1989 court ruling.  It is about Article One of the Constitution.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 15:50, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm sure we can agree that something needs to be said about the separation of legislative power in the overview of the Article One.  I would like to work with you on the wording of that overview.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 16:05, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

*The doctrine of [[Separation of powers]] is based on several parts of the Constitution, not just Article One.  Anyway, it is already mentioned in the "Principles of government" section.--[[User:JW1805|JW1805]] 16:52, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

::I'm not talking about any doctrine that could be argued or confused.  I'm talking about the actual text.  The summary of the first article fails to mention anything about the first and most important sentence: "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives."  If you're not going to summarize it, at least quote it and let people decide for themselves.  A court ruling 203 years later doesn't change the actual text of Article One.  Pretending it no longer exists is incorrect and deceptive.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 17:21, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

::Are you arguing that because the other sections incorrectly summarize their article that we should incorrectly summarize Article One as well?  There is a gaping hole in the summary.  Every other concept of Article One is addressed, but any mention of the first and most important sentence is skipped.  Why is this?  Because the other summaries are equally deficient?  I don't think so.  Allowing for the best of intentions, I would have to say that mention of the first sentence is skipped because it is too controversial.  Yet, the summary isn't about controversy, vague doctrines, or late rulings.  It is a summary of the text.  As such, it fails.  If you want to help word something that will make it succeed, I would be happy to do that with you.

: I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and wikified any dates of the forms "month day", "month day, year", and "month year" that I could find.

: — [[User:DLJessup|DLJessup]] ([[User talk:DLJessup|talk]]) 00:15, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

i'm puzzled why you would respond to my comment that way. i noted, or at least implied, that wikifications of partial dates can be undesirable, and that i plan to remove them... so you add more for me to undo? the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style %28dates and numbers%29#Date formatting|MoS]] is clear on date formatting:

::''If the date doesn't contain a day and a month, then date preferences won't work, and square brackets won't respond to your readers' auto-formatting preferences. So unless there is a special relevance of the date link, there's no need to link it. This is an important point: simple years, decades and centuries should only be linked if there's a strong reason for doing so.''

so unless somebody provides a strong reason for linking single years, months, and "month year", i'm going to undo them. they never should have been wikified. why people wikify them is a mystery to me, though i guess it's a natural result of a pretty dumb, confusing protocol (linking merely for pref formatting). perhaps the only thing stupider in the system is the case sensitivity &mdash; well, that and the average admin. [[User:Wbfl|Wbfl]] 02:14, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

: Well, I thought that the partial applied to the wikification, not the dates; it's clear that I've been dealing with the mangled grammar of this place for far too long.  I thought I understood what you were doing and didn't bother to actually check the MoS.  It is also, shall we say, less than intuitive that they would offer the formats "16:12, 2001 January 15" and "2001-01-15 16:12:34" and then not offer the ability to flip the year and month for dates of format "January 2001".  Sorry about that.  I've fixed the "month year" wikifications.

: — [[User:DLJessup|DLJessup]] ([[User talk:DLJessup|talk]]) 04:51, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

It's actually worse than is implied by the MoS quote:  if you set your preferences to either of the formats "16:12, 2001 January 15" or "2001-01-15 16:12:34", only dates containing both the "month day"/"day month" and "year" links order properly; the "month day" or "day month" links don't conform to preferences.

== Preamble interpretation ==

I reverted the following (actually [[User:Bkonrad|Bkonrad]] beat me to it, but anyway):

''The Preamble is expressive of the purpose of the United States government which is intended to be an incorporation (corporation) of the will of the people and hence provides for extensive power by that public Corporation of the people (US Government) to do all that is 'necessary and proper' to establish equal [[Justice]], provide for the defense of the Union, promote economic expansion and industry (See [[American System of Capitalism]]), and to secure [[Liberty]] (the right to do all you wish to do so long as you do no harm to others) for the Citizens (We the People) of the country. The preamble, especially the first three words ("We the people"), is one of the most quoted and referenced sections of the Constitution.''

Interpreting the preamble may be appropriate for this article if such an interpretation is based on the actual words of the preamble itself. The interpretation provided by the anonymous poster doesn't fall into that category. The preamble has no reference to the words "corporation", "incorporation", and "necessary and proper", "industry", "economic expansion", "citizens" (although that is in the constitution, it's in article I, not the preamble). Furthermore, such loaded terms as "justice" and "liberty" should probably not be interpreted by half a sentence in parantheses, nor should they be linked to general WP articles about the term without qualification. Hence, it was my opinion that this interpretation is wholly inadequate for WP and therefore subject to removal. If anyone disagrees, please let me know here. I'd especially like to hear from the original author what his or her thoughts were when producing this.
[[User:Sebmol|sebmol]] 19:09, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

:The above preamble exlanation was badly worded I admit. But the intention was to display what the meaning of each phrase meant.  In particular the phrase 'to promote the general Welfare' has much meaning if you read the Founders on this.  It was an economic point made.  The Confederate constitution did not contain that clause because it infered(sic) that the Federal government was created in part to ensure that Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture (read Hamilton one of the men who helped write the Constitution and one of the authors of the Federalist Papers) could be promoted by the government using protective tariffs, subsidies or bounties as it were, and other devices including and not limited to a Bank of the United States to establish credit and so on.  There is a long tradition of 'promoting the general Welfare' going back to the ideas of the Renaissance.  NORTHMEISTER  

:I resubmitted an edit in the preamble updating my language, check it and see what you think.  I want it to remain neutral but represent the Founder's intentions based on what they read and wrote, including the major work of Vattel on international law. -NORTHMEISTER

::The problem with the interpretation you provided isn't just a question of wording. The problem I see with it is that it tries to infer an interpretation in a certain way. Especially, the usage of words not contained in the preamble like 'corporation' (which has a very distinct legal meaning) needs to be in a very careful manner. If you believe that the interpretation you provide is correct, you have got to cite specific sources that acknowledge that. Redefining the word 'union' as 'corporation', for example, is not warranted unless you have some other reputable source that did so.

::Another problem I find is with the interpretation "to secure liberty for the citizens of the country" with wiki links to the generic articles for "liberty", "citizen", and "country". The Constitution at many different places makes a distinction between people and citizens which have led to many still standing precedents that people who are not citizens still have certain rights under the constitution (most notably the right to due process). Furthermore, the understanding of the term "liberty" for example as meant in the preamble may or may not entail everything the [[Liberty]] article. Providing an unqualified link just to [[Liberty]] alone is inappropriate and misleading, in my opinion. I'm going to revert your addition and hope that we can come to some sort of agreement here before posting back into the original article. [[User:Sebmol|sebmol]] 07:32, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:You bring up excellent points and I accept your reasoning behind not linking to generic articles on [[Liberty]] for example, the link to country was appropriate because the Constitution is intended for the United States of America and not for elsewhere, on "Citizens" I also accept your argument as legitimate as you make an excellent point about due process.  The explanation there, now, is inadequate concerning the preamble as per the Supreme Court's decisions concerning its intent.  The preamble is loaded with symbolic and meaningful words especially for the time it was written.  One of the reasons the Confederate States of America took out the words 'promote the general Welfare' was because the meanings intention was very well known to the early generations of Americans as the expressive power of the Federal government to promote and protect the economy as expressed later on in the Constitution with specific delegated powers to "lay and collect imposts, duties...", "promote useful arts and sciences", etc.  So the reverted explanation is lacking.  It was a grant of very general purposes and powers on the specific purposes of the Constitution and nation.  Essentially this part of the article should outline the phrases and their meaning more clearly to modern readers, so as to understand them.  I do agree with your revert for now.  I would like to work with you on the proper wording for neutrality, clearness, cites and to ensure an accurate explanation beyond what exists at present and what I posted. --[[User:Northmeister|Northmeister]] 12:48, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

== Second Amendment POV removed ==

I have removed lengthy and argumentative POV comments from the heading for the Second Amendment. There is a separate article dealing just with the Second Amendment, and that is the place for a detailed explanation of the law relating to this amendment.  Many other amendments have much more case law clarifying their legal effect, but they all have just a sentence or two in this article.  I do not believe it is appropriate for this amendment to have a much longer description.  In addition, the tone of the removed material, which described one position as persons who seek to "abolish private ownership of guns in America" and described another position as being supported by "scholarly research" was not neutral. The separate article on the Second Amendment is the appropriate place to go into the debate on the scope and effect of the Second Amendment [[User:Kmorford|Kmorford]] 18:30, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

::::The deletions I have made make the section dealing with the Second Amendment consistent (in length and style) with the sections dealing with the other amendments in the bill of rights. That is not vandalism, it is an improvement of the article. There is no reason why the relationship of the Second Amendment to other parts of the constitution cannot be dealt with in the separate article on the Second Amendment. The small edit you did on one phase did not even come close to removing the objectionable POV problems with the removed sections. Even if you fixed all of the objectionable parts, it would still not be appropritate for inclusion in this article.  Put it in the separate article. Here is the removed section, with the objectionable POV parts in capitalized letters.    

::::Current case law, including the few U.S. Supreme Court decisions, tends to assert that the "right of the people to keep and bear Arms" is an individual right but not an absolute right, and that the states and federal government may omit certain classes of people from the general-public sense of the "militia" for cause, such as criminal record, youth or senility, or mental incapacity, and may limit the types of weapons to which the right applies. The Supreme Court first examined the Second Amendment in United States v. Cruikshank (1875), ruling that the right to keep and bear arms, being recognized but not created by the Second Amendment, is not conditional on United States citizenship and thus is not one of the "privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States" binding on the member States under the Fourteenth Amendment. (SUCH AN ARGUMENT HAS RARELY IF EVER BEEN APPLIED TO OTHER CLAUSES.)

::::As a result of the scarcity of case law, SOME WHO SEEK TO ABOLISH PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF GUNS IN AMERICA HAVE CLAIMED that the Second Amendment is "unincorporated" and hence does not apply to the states. However, SOME SCHOLARS dispute the relevance of this claim; "The almost total incorporation of the Bill of Rights lends support to the theory that incorporation of the Second Amendment is inevitable," according to Regina McClendon of the Public Law Research Institute, in a paper published in 1994. [1] STILL, THIS, AND OTHER LEGAL RESEARCH, DOES NOT PREVENT SOME ANTI-GUN ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS FROM CONTINUING TO CLAIM THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS SOMEHOW INVALID THROUGH VIRTUE OF NOT HAVING YET BEEN FULLY INCORPORATED THROUGH THE CREATION OF A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF CASE LAW AND FULL INCORPORATION INTO THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.

::::HOWEVER, FOR A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING, ONE MUST LOOK TO Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), before the US Supreme Court in a Fourteenth Amendment case. In the decision for this case, Justice Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion that, "While the Ninth Amendment - and indeed the entire Bill of Rights - originally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties. And, the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement." HENCE THE STATES ARE PROHIBITED FROM ABRIDGING PERSONAL LIBERTIES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATIVE TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT, BEING THAT THE  SECOND AMENDMENT IS PART OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

Subject to the three reversion rule, which you will eventually get caught by if you are not careful, I intend to continue to remove the objectionable material.  Wikipedia guidelines call for this dispute to be resolved through talk if at all possible, or through dispute resolution mechanisms if talk does not work.

: Kmorford is right, this should be a short entry like every other amendment entry.  Debates about the amendment belong on the amendment's own discussion page, not this page.  Do not worry about Yaf's accusation that you vandalized the page.  The material deleted was not "arrived at through consensus over many months among editors."  It was added without any debate despite the work of many editors to produce a concise, clearly NPOV article.  The entry is also wrong - many courts have ruled on the Second Amendment and they have overwhelmingly held that it is not an individual right.  The Supreme Court, 1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Circuits have all held that it is not an individual right, while a 5th Circuit panel split 2-1 to hold that it is.  But this also is better suited to the discussion pages, not the page on the Constitution.  Also, it is simply a fact that the Second Amendment has not been incorporated.  Citing one person's opinion from 12 years ago that it may soon be incorporated may be worth the discussion page, but not the main page.

==Suspending the Constitution==

I am curious if there's any situation where the U.S. Constitution can be suspended and the U.S. could go into another form of government to deal with an emergency.  An example would be would the Constitution have been suspended if the U.S. ever was attacked by nuclear weapons during the [[Cold War]] and thus being drawn into [[World War III]].  Also, if there is was ever a terrorist attack on Washington D.C., wher the entire Congress was killed, could the Constitution be declared in abeyance.  "[[The Handmaid's Tale]]" is a book that references the Constitution being suspended, but is that really true?  Could it happen? -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 20:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

:The text itself doesn't really provide for something like that. A very small number of civil rights can be suspended during wartime but the general functioning of the government as described by the constitution can't change. If there was a major disaster (e.g. a nuclear weapon hits DC without warning and eliminates most of the federal government), I would imagine that the states would conduct new elections for a new Congress, the next Person in line becomes President and appoints new Justices, Judges and Secretaries (probably recess appointments until a new Senate is elected) and a barrage of legal cases would make its way through the federal judiciary testing whether all of this was legal.

:Since military command is fairly decentraliced in the US and since each state has its own national guard, a suitable military response could be engaged in even if the federal government is inoperable. The constitution gives states the right, for example, to engage in war activities if they have been invaded and no other recourse is available. Also, much more of the day-to-day "running of the country" is done on the state and local level, which would be largely unaffected by such an event.

:But, to answer your question directly: no, the constitution doesn't have any provision to allow for its suspension. [[User:Sebmol|sebmol]] 20:38, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

::That's an awesome answer.  It probably should be put into the article somehow.  Maybe either directly or into a new article about radical changes to the U.S. government. -[[User:Husnock|Husnock]] 21:03, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

:[[Tom Clancy]] explored this in [[Executive Orders]].  In that book, most of the federal government is wiped out when a Japanese pilot crashes an airliner into the [[Capitol Building]].
Jack Ryan, who was made VP just before the attack, assumes the Presidency and governs via executive orders.

Realistically speaking, it would be almost impossible to wipe out the entire federal government, largely because its never really assembled together at once.  During States of the Union, for example, a member of the President's cabinet is randomly chosen to be ushered away to a secure location.  I believe some members of Congress are also hidden away.

Now, if *somehow* the entire government were wiped out, the Constitution still wouldn't be suspended.  I'd imagine the state governors would assume control and maintain order until emergency Congressional elections could be held.  I say Congressional elections, because Presidential ones wouldn't really be needed, because whoever is chosen as the new Speaker of the House would automatically become President.  After that, he or she could then just appoint a new cabinet and whamo, solid provincial government until more elections could be held, since the Congressmen elected would probably just finish out the terms of the people they replaced.--[[User:Kross|Kross]][[User talk:Kross|<sup>Talk</sup>]] 03:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

*There's nothing in the Constitution giving the people the right to overthrow the government. The closest thing to that is Article 5, which along with the procedure for making amendments, also outlines the procedure for calling a new convention to rewrite the Constitution. You need to have two thirds of the state legislatures call for a convention; then have the amended Constitution approved by either a three quarters vote at the Convention or by three quarters of the states.

Yes. I believe it is stated in the Declaration of Independence. But it is most deffinately not "far out." It is one of the most powerful statements in the whole of those documents, as important as "all men are created equal" and others. It gave us our reason for splitting off from England. And if the US ever becomes a government not of the people, we have the stated right to over throw it and create an new one in it's place. Please tell me most people know this. Nothing against you if you just didn't know... but WHO the Heck taught you???????? They didn't do a good job. :( You need to speak to them about this. (Edit: I'm sorry. I was just shocked. You sound smart, it's just that everyone should know this, especially if you're american. if you're not, forgive my out burst.)

Provide links that back up your accuracy; educate yourselves in the process.

== Ratified by "The People" or "the States"? ==

This is a serious question that was directly addressed in [[McCulloch v. Maryland]], a binding decision of the United States Supreme Court. John Marshall emphatically and unequivocally stated that the Constitution was ratified by the people, ''not state governments.'' The distinction is subtle but important. It is true that there was considerable overlap between the identities of state delegates and state legislators, but that is no argument against what follows. Please read and consider the following very carefully if you think that there is any doubt that "We the People" refers to the people assembling in their states, not the state governments acting as sovereign entities.

<blockquote>
...the counsel for the State of Maryland have deemed it of some importance, in the construction of the constitution, to consider that instrument as not emanating from the people, but as the act of sovereign and independent states... ''it would be difficult to sustain this proposition''. The Convention which framed the constitution was indeed elected by the state legislatures. But the instrument, when it came from their hands, was a mere proposal, without obligation, or pretentions to it. It was then reported to the then existing Congress of the United States, with a request that it might "be submitted to a convention of delegates, chosen in each state by the people thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature, for their assent and ratification." This mode of proceeding was adopted; and by the convention, by Congress, and by the state legislatures, ''the instrument was submitted to the people.'' They acted on it in the only manner in which they can act safely, effectively, and wisely, on such a subject, by assembling in convention. It is true, they assembled in their several states -- and where else should they have assembled? No political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines which separate the states, and of compounding the American people into one common mass. Of consequence, when they act, they act in their states. ''But the measures they adopt do not, on that account, cease to be measures of the people themselves, or become the measures of state governments.''

''From these conventions the constitution derives its whole authority. The government proceeds directly from the people;'' is "ordained and established" in the name of the people; and is declared to be ordained, "in order to form a more perfect union..." The assent of the states, in their sovereign capacity, is implied in calling a convention, and thus submitting that instrument to the people. But the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it; and their act was final. ''It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the state governments. The constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties. The government of the Union, then,... is, emphatically, and truly, a government of the people. In form and substance it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit."'' (emphasis added)

== Wording of introduction re State Sovereignty not clear ==

The introduction notes "''When delegates in nine states of the then thirteen states ratified the document, it marked the creation of a union of sovereign states'', and a federal government to administer that union."  I'm reading that, and it can mean either two things: 1) that the states were sovereign prior to the the union, or 2) that the states were sovereign prior to their union and that the Union is composed of states that retain that sovereignty.

If 1) is correct, the sentence should be reworded as "When delegates in nine states of the then thirteen ''sovereign'' states ratified the document, it marked the creation of a ''sovereign Union of states'', and a federal government to administer that Union."

If 2) is correct, the sentence should be reworded as "When delegates in nine states of the then thirteen ''sovereign'' states ratified the document, it marked the creation of a union of states ''which retained their sovereignty'', and a federal government to administer that union."

Based on the article body, I believe that 1) is the correct interpretation. [[User:Patiwat|Patiwat]] 20:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

::No.  Actually it is 3) ''the states were sovereign prior to the union, the Union is composed of states that retain their sovereignty, and the Union has its own sovereignty as well (albeit restricted to just the limited rights defined in the Constitution), and all other rights are retained either by the states (which remain sovereign) or by the citizens (who are also sovereign in ''their'' enumerated and unenumerated rights.)''  For example, it is possible to be a US Citizen and not be a Citizen of a State.  Such a person would have rights to a US Passport, for example, but would not have a claim to a right reserved to a citizen of any particular state.  For example, consider citizens in Puerto Rico, or in D.C.; they fall into this category.  [[User:Yaf|Yaf]] 04:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

== magna whata? ==

I don't really know what I would write for wikipedia, but hopefully someone will pick this up.  Just a little note about the U.S. Constitution being influenced greatly by the Iroquois Confederacy.  There is no mention of that at all in the article that exists now, and I think it is seriously lacking because of that oversight.  All in all it is a good explanation of the Constitution but if you are going to mention the Magna Carta and the Dutch, then you HAVE to include the Iroquois who had one of the world's oldest democracies and I would say greatly influenced the structure of our own.  
==Write a new Constitution==

:Well, now you're changing the subject --- which is fine. The original "Rewrite" material in [[Talk:United States Constitution]] was polemical matter of no relevance to the article.

In particular:
* The Lazare work in [[User talk:JW1805]] is not by a constitutional scholar or even a lawyer, but a freelance journalist who writes about race, drugs, and urban policy.
* [[The English Constitution]] is about the '''English''' constitution
* Someone upthread referenced a book crticizing the constituion but nothing in that article referred to a re-writing; at most, an amending AFAIK.

I have never read the Lazare or Levinson books, and don't know if they are notable or not.  (The link I provided was a quite negative review).  I have read Bagehot, and it does contains lots of material on the US Constituion, specifically comparing it to the English unwritten one, which he believes is much more flexable and far superior (citing the post-Civil War government chaos as example).  (From a blurb I saw on the Lazare book, it looks like he basically has a similar argument, but I haven't read it).  Bagehot certainly is notable, and influenced [[Woodrow Wilson]], who at one point suggested that the US should adopt a Parliamentary system.  It is certainly reasonable that stuff like this could go in the article. --<b>[[User:JW1805|JW1805]]</b> <small>[[User talk:JW1805|(Talk)]]</small> 01:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

All the states voted for it, and Morris' detailed discussion (pp 299-322) of the debates does not say anyone in the ratifying conventions complained about "illegality."

==Criticism vs Praise==
Seems interesting that we have a Criticism section and no Praise section.  Nevertheless it's disturbing that the limited content in this section should include the thoughts of a man who thinks the Founders were '''profoundly ignorant''' of the future when they drafted the document.   --[[User:The Founders Intent|<font color="green">'''''T<small>HE</small> F<small>OUNDERS</small> I<small>NTENT </small>'''''</font>]]<sup>[[User talk:The Founders Intent|''PRAISE'']]</sup> 12:42, 15 April 2010 (UTC)

Agreed, there should be a praise section, given that it is a very influential document. Also, Dr. Nelson's argument seems ill-fitting here as she seems to be more concerned with the current state of affairs and not the enumerated powers, if this is the case it should be made clear.

== Branches of Government ==
{{tn|The article now reads: "The Constitution defines the three main branches of government: a legislature, the bicameral Congress; an executive branch led by the President; and a judicial branch headed by the Supreme Court." I propose to change this sentence to read: "The Constitution defines the three branches of the national government ..." The word "main" implies, wrongly, that there are other branches of government. There is a scholarly debate about the relationship between the administrative agencies and the executive, but I think there is no question the agencies are within the executive branch. The addition of the word "national" is a nod to our federal system: the state governments exist independently of the Constitution and are not defined by it, except to the extent the Constitution guarantees each state a republican form of government.

== Preamble ==

I have revised the discussion of the Preamble. The prior version made unsourced assertions about the relationship of the preamble to the powers of the federal government and the retained powers of the people and the states. In fact, the preamble is, on its face, silent about those issues. The discussion in McCulloch v. Maryland, which I reference, is a good authoritative explanation of what seems to me to be the key point of the preamble, namely, that the Constitution emanates from "We, the People," not "We, the states."

== Article IV ==

"Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, especially by citizens who live near state borders; but in the days of the Articles of Confederation, crossing state lines was often a much more arduous and costly process."

Not only is the preceding someone's opinion, it is also false. It is simply that these hypothetical persons may be unaware of the article's existence or meaning. "Taken for granted", in my opinion, carries a connotation of awareness ''and'' apathy, whereas this is not the case. I cannot speak to the facts about inter-state travel in a historical context, and therefore consider it simply unsourced. 

Aside from my personal opinion, the sentence also breaks the scholarly flow of overall paragraph by attempting to provide current and historical context. I ask that the sentence be removed, or someone else's opinion on the matter.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Fanman904|Fanman904]] ([[User talk:Fanman904|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fanman904|contribs]]) 06:26, 8 July 2010 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
== "Criticism of the Constitution" Section ==

The "Criticism of the Constitution" section features one essentially non-partisan criticism (Sabato's recommendations regarding primary elections) and three that are discernibly left wing in their implications and arguments.  If this section is to remain, it should be either: 1) balanced with other criticisms (e.g., criticisms of the broad use of the Commerce Clause as a catch-all for the expansion of federal power; criticisms of over-broad judicial and congressional interpretations of the "enumerated powers" clause by invocation of the "necessary and proper" clause; etc.) that usually emanate from the political right; 2) edited for removal of any criticisms that express a discernible political ideology, left or right; 3) relocated to a separate article where the issue of constitutional critics and criticisms can be discussed in greater detail and with opportunities for criticisms from all political angles to be included; 4) or removed altogether.  As currently written, it violates the Wikipedia "neutral point of view" principle. ~~Michael Higginbotham~~  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/38.106.227.213|38.106.227.213]] ([[User talk:38.106.227.213|talk]]) 04:32, 23 July 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Do you have any specific, notable criticisms in mind, for example respected historians and/or political scientists who have such criticisms?  The ones in the article seem quite neutral to me.  I wouldn't find the arguement, for example, against the electoral college to be particularly left wing.  Its been levied by many people throughout history.  Perhaps you could present some sources for people to review from respected political scientists, if you have some ideas of what to add to the article.

== Oldest constitution, again ==

Sorry to say this and repeat this topic, but San Marino has the oldest Constitution. As according to Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521449/San-Marino], CIA's The World Factbook [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sm.html] and the United States Library of Congress [http://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/sanmarino.php], San Marino's constitution dates back to 1600. These are as good and verifiable as a sources come, unlike the note provided in the text: ''"The San Marino document is a constitutional document, not a constitution. Calling it such would be the same as saying Magna Carta is a constitution."'' Ignoring this is by large original research, I'm not even sure what does that even mean. Isn't the constitution itself a constitutional document?

::Read the article about San Marino's document for reliable sources. Nothing in the CIA Factbook or LoC guide contradicts that. Its constitution consists of more than one document, one of which dates back to the 1600s. What part of that is so hard for you to understand? -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 06:26, 27 September 2010 (UTC)

:::Please be [[WP:CIVIL]]. Anyway, the dispute really rests on how strictly one defines "written constistution", especially in a national sense, and ''whose'' reliable sources one relies on. In a neutral encyclopedia, if both views are supported by reliable sources, then both views should be presented. - [[User:BilCat|BilCat]] ([[User talk:BilCat|talk]]) 07:50, 27 September 2010 (UTC)
::::I'm too exasperated to care whether anyone thinks my last question was not civil. This is really quite simple, so I find the repeated deletion of sourced material more than a little annoying. The content as written is completely accurate. If we were to use the construction that makes San Marino's older, then Britain's would be far older because Magna Carta beat it by about 400 years. If people are so bloody amazed that San Marino and the UK use documents that are older, there's no reason why they can't be noted, but it would be nice if people would take the trouble to understand the difference between a constitution like ours, where one document constitutes the whole, and that of a place like San Marino, where multiple documents make up the constitution. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 09:12, 27 September 2010 (UTC)

:::::::If I could make two points. it would be appreciated. The United Kingdom's constitution does not qualify as the wor;ld's oldest constitution still in continuous use because of the fact that is is [[uncodified]]. Of course, much of British consitutional law is written down in one form or another through various statutes over the years, but as a single and complete source, there is no such thing as a U.K. or British Constitution. My second point is this. The Statutes of 1600 in the country of San Marino are just that--- statutes. There is a very fine line of what we can define as a constitution. Nevertheless, it certainly wasn't called a constitution in 1600 when it was ratified. Equally, the entire Constitution of San Marino does not revolve around one single source or document. In fact, San marino's constitution, if you want to call it that, is basically a series of compiled books of statutory laws enacted by that country's legislation.

:::::::Speaking from an American perspective, I think there has to be some lee-way here. I think those who advocate that the claim that the U.S. Constitution is the oldest written constitution need to put things into perspective. The U,S. as I know it is indeed the world's oldest [[federation]] (to date), not discounting the country of Switzerland, which is the world's oldest [[confederation]]. But is the United States Constitution really the oldest? If you look at the Wiki article on '''[[Constitution of Massachusetts]]''', it also claims to be the "the oldest functioning written constitution in continuous effect in the world" which was ratified in 1780, seven years '''BEFORE''' the United States Constituttion was ratified. As I see it, this article is contradicting the information found on '''[[Constitution of Massachusetts]]'''. Simply put, there are U.S. state constitutions which are '''OLDER''' than the United States Constitution which are still in use. 

:::::::So to say that the "United States Constitution is the oldest written constitution still in use"....there are big problems with that statement given the points made above.[[User:Yoganate79|Yoganate79]] ([[User talk:Yoganate79|talk]]) 09:11, 8 October 2010 (UTC)
::::::::It does not say that the "United States Constitution is the oldest written constitution still in use". It says, "The United States Constitution is the oldest written constitution still in use '''by any nation''' in the world. [emphasis added]". It does not say that it is the oldest constitution in the world, it says it is the oldest ''national'' constitution in the world. As far as I know, no one is claiming that Massachusetts is a nation-state. I am not going to debate the merits of the statement with regard to San Marino, the Magna Carta, or whatever, but your concern is not an issue.

:::::::: Ignorance is bliss. Have you ever taken the time to read the reference in the link at the bottom of the page? The claim made is... "The only national museum for the world's oldest and shortest written constitution." Where ever is there any mentioning of the phrase nation-state in this sentence? It merely says world's oldest and shortest written constitution. By that token as discussed above and since the reference bears no mentioning to any nation-state, the claim has already been disproven since Massachusetts has a constituttion which was ratified in 1780, thus making it the world's oldest. 

:::::::: Also, if you refer to the Wiki article [[Constitution#Modern constitutions|Constitution]], the article there claims that San Marino has the world's oldest constitution, thereby making this article conflict with what is said in that article. Read it. I simply don't care one way or another. Hence why I refuse to let my students at school  use Wikipedia as any credible reference material. I wouldn't expect a change on here nor do I think you should expect the article [[Constitution]] to ever change.

::::::::: Exactly. Plus, the idea of using a museum advertisement a reference is ridiculous on its own. And as for Rrius, how can you say there is no contradiction when both pages I provided state that San Marino's constitution is from 1600, almost 2 centuries before the United States' one? Has San Marino's constitution changed over time? Yes, but so has the US one. It's been two months since I brought up this problem, yet no acceptable source to back up that claim has been posted yet.

::::::::This is tiresome. The particular document is just one part of San Marino's constitution.

== Ratification of the Corwin Amendment ==

The section on un-ratified amendments states regarding the Corwin Amendment states 

"The Corwin Amendment, proposed by the 36th Congress  on March 2, 1861, would have forbidden any attempt to subsequently amend the Constitution to empower the federal government to "abolish or interfere" with the "domestic institutions" of the states (a delicate way of referring to slavery). It was ratified by only Ohio and Maryland lawmakers before the outbreak of the Civil War. Illinois  lawmakers—sitting as a state constitutional convention at the time—likewise approved it, but that action is of questionable validity. The proposed amendment contains no expiration date for ratification and may yet be ratified. However, adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War likely means that the amendment would be ineffective if adopted."

The statement that the adoption of the 13th,14th and 15th amendments would render the Corwin amendment ineffective if adopted is incorrect. This should be in the least changed to state that it would be ineffective for its originally intended primary purpose, in other words,it would NOT preserve the institution of slavery. Its should also be worded in such a way as to avoid the assumption that its only purpose was to preserve slavery. It should be safe to go with the assumption that most scholars have made that it was primarily intended to preserve slavery,but while slavery was a major factor in the civil war there were other issues of "states rights" that were involved as well and presumably the Corwin amendment may well have been intended to additionally affect those,otherwise why mention state institutions at all rather than saying only that slavery was to be preserved. The Corwin amendment states "No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State." There are many other domestic institutions other than slavery which the Corwin amendment might apply. A constitutional amendment banning gay marriage might well fall under its effect as might the 17th amendment if it were successfully argued that the selection of a states representatives were a domestic institution, and the 26th amendment which makes the voting age universally 18,as state voting laws,so long as they are in compliance with all other applicable parts of the constituion are widely held to be up to each individual state,and thus a domestic institution and perhaps even the 19th amendment for similar reasons.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/174.27.219.185|174.27.219.185]] ([[User talk:174.27.219.185|talk]]) 10:40, 26 September 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP -->

== Rename: Articles of the... to Sections of the Constitution and add 2.9 ==

The preamble is not an article, so the current title has appeal, but it's incorrect. And that error leads the editors to omit a part of the Constitution itself (since it's not an Article per se). The part incorrectly omitted by this article is the dating sentence, which [http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_zoom_4.html on the original] is in large script similar to that which titles the Articles, and is therefore nothing like the textual corrections which appear to it's left. These improvements and additions are recommended (but I'm too new to this to make these changes myself on such an important article, so instead of putting this in the article, I'm just making this recommendation):

==More than 13 states==
There were more than 13 states when the Constitution was ratified.  The info box with the votes should include all the states' votes.

: Are you sure?  I'm pretty sure there were 13 colonies at the time (they weren't technically states until they ratified the constitution individually in their respective colonies).  The Virginias split during the American Revolution, if that is what you are referring to (in which case, West Virginia wouldn't be considered a state at the time).

:: What on Earth are you talking about?  First of all the States had stopped being colonies for some time before the writing of the US Constitution.  The colonies declared their independence in 1776, formed The United States under the Articles of Confederation in 1777, and the 13th state (Rhode Island) approved the current Constitution in 1790.  Vermont (the 14th state) didn't join until 1791.  Furthermore West Virginia didn't split away from Virginia until the US Civil War.  It joined the Union in 1863.

And besides, they technically aren't "states" if they didn't ratify the Constitution, right? --[[Special:Contributions/68.100.241.43|68.100.241.43]] ([[User talk:68.100.241.43|talk]]) 07:38, 10 December 2007 (UTC)
:::: The American colonies became U.S. states on July 4, 1776, after the (historically canonical) signing of the Declaration of Independence. That is, after the official independence, the states were technically considered states, not colonies, regardless of when they decided to ratify the U.S. Constitution. Cf. Ron Chernow's "Alexander Hamilton" and David McCullough's "1776". --Unregistered user.

Q103. "I have heard that the U.S. Constitution is based on a document called the 'Iroquois Confederation'. Is this true, and if so what parts of the Constitution came from this document?"

A. The U.S. Constitution is not based on that of the Iroquois Confederation - but some of the delegates to the Convention knew of the Confederation (notably Benjamin Franklin) and the two documents share many concepts, as do many constitutions. The Five Nations was a federal-style system, and it shared that with the U.S. You can find it online, though it is slightly difficult reading - the Indians spoke often in concept and metaphor.

To acknowledge the contribution of the Iroquois Confederacy of

and to reaffirm the continuing government-to-government
relationship between Indian tribes and the United States
established in the Constitution.
Whereas the original framers of the Constitution, including most

Confederacy and,
Whereas the constitution of the original Thirteen Colonies into

Whereas since the formation of the United States, the Congress
has recognized the sovereign status of Indian tribes, and
has, through the exercise of powers reserved to the Federal
Government in the Commerce Clause of the Constitution
(art. I s8, oI.9), dealt with Indian Tribes on a government
to-government basis and has, through the treaty clause (art.
62, Cl.a) entered into three hundred and Seventy treaties
with Indian tribal nations; and,
Whereas from the first treaty entered into with an Indian
nation, the treaty with the Delaware Indian of September
17, 1778, and thereafter in every Indian treaty until the
cessation of treaty making in 1871, the Congress has assumed
a trust responsibility and obligation to Indian tribes
and their members to "exercise the utmost good faith in
dealings with the Indians" as provided for in the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787, (l Stat: 50); and,
Whereas Congress has consistently reaffirmed these fundamental
polices over the past two hundred years through legislation
specifically designed to honor this special relationship; and,
Whereas, the judicial system of the United States has consistently
recognized and reaffirmed this special relationship:
Now. Therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of
Representatives Concurring), That
(1) The Congress, on the occasion of the two hundredreth anniversary of
the signing of the United States Constitution, acknowledges the
historical debt which this Republic of the United States of America
owes to the Iroquois Confederacy and other Indian Nations for their
demonstration of enlightened, democratic principals of Government
and their example of a free association independent Indian Nations;
(2) The Congress also hereby reaffirms the constitutionship recognized

historically been the cornerstone of this Nation's Indian policy;
(3) The Congress specifically acknowledges and reaffirms the responsibility
and obligation of the United States Governments to Indian tribes,
including Alaskan Natives, for their preservation, protection and
enhancement, including the provision of health, education, social
and economic assistance programs as necessary to assist tribes to
perform their governmental responsibility to provide for the social and

== suggestions for a rather major rewrite ==

Hi. Though I've been a big fan and user of wikipedia for a while, this is my first contribution. I think whoever wrote this entry did a lot of good work but, since it is the most important document in US history, it needs some clean-up. The first issue to resolve is the scope - what do we mean by "constitution?" I think we have to limit it (for clarity and space) as much as possible to the document itself, including some propositions beyond controversy (i.e. Congress has enumerated powers, Federal Courts are of limited jurisdiction, etc.), some historical context, and links to the various other pages its treatment will require. So, here are my (bear with me) numerous suggestions.

1) THE LEAD: I would lose the part about San Marino's statutes - They are not a "constitution." Nor is the Magna Carta, for example, although it influenced both the US constitution and later English Law. So, If you're going to assert that it is the oldest living national constitution (which I believe it is), I would start with that. Next, I would moved down, edit, and provide a link for the details of the convention and later ratification. Also, it's not that it "has a central place in American law and political culture" but, in fact, is the basis (or source) of the entire legal and political system. If you want to further stress its' importance, I would replace "the supreme law..." (not entirely instructive) and add a fact. I would also lose the part about the "engrossed copy..." since, among others, that fact is repeated in the adjacent box. (Speaking of which, I don't think you can say "original copy.") Thus:

"Ratified on September 17, 1789 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, The Constitution of the United States of America is the world's oldest living national constitution. It establishes a democratic republic, and provides the basis for the American legal and political system. All military and government officers must take an oath to protect and preserve the constitution before entering public service. Many of its concepts derived from European and Ancient sources. Several of them, however, (Federalism, Elasticity and Judicial Review) constitute original contributions to democratic theory."

2) HISTORY: I would change this as being vague. In a sense, the "history" of the constitution includes all of history to the present (since it has ancient influence and is a living, changing document, the latter of which needs to be emphasized and clarified.) I agree it's important to go into the framers, the convention, the ratification, etc. but I don't think it should be so detailed on the main page. Perhaps instead of "history" it could be "ORIGINS," then a few words about them with links to more in-depth articles. To that end, I don't think, as asserted, Montesquieu, was the "most important" European influence. That needs attribution. Nor do I agree with the characterization of Polybius' writings or the conclusion that "he" was a significant source. Many ancient sources influenced the framers, notably Plutarch's account of Lycurgus (see, eg, The Federalist Nos. 6 (Hamilton) 18 (Madison and Hamilton) and 32 (Madison). These issues are important but need to be sourced and, for purposes of the main article, should simply be mentioned.

3) SLAVERY: As it stands, this is mentioned under the "work of the Philadelphia Convention." Instead, it needs to be in the discussion of the text. Also, although the current summary is basically correct, I think it doesn't reflect a subtlety of the text. Wiki says "3/5 of the number of slaves would be counted..." The text says: ..."the whole Number of free Persons...and...three fifths of all other Persons." The latter more strongly implies the nature of slaves as property (i.e. divisible). I don't think the main page should go into slavery more than that, but there should be a link to slavery in American history as well as the role it played in the constitutional debates. (Maybe, also, a link at the bottom to PLESSY V. FERGUSON, since segregation was a "constitutional" decision).

4) "THE BIBLE". I saw a comment that was concerned there was no mention of the the "undisputed" fact that the bible was a source. I don't really understand that. Although it's certainly true that many of the "framers" were (to varying degrees) people of Christian belief, what is notable about the constitution is that God isn't in it. In fact, the only mention of "religion" at all is to prohibit the government from establishing it or infringing the people's right to practice it.

5) THE PREAMBLE: I feel this needs to be edited in part, moved in part, and cut in part. I think a brief discussion of the sovereignty of the people is warranted but much of it is either extraneous (i.e. the part of it not conferring powers), wrong (i.e. the notion that the Federal Government is (doctrinally) no longer one of "enumerated powers,") misleading (i.e. the assertion that "we the people" is "one of the most quoted and referenced section" of the constitution), retrospective or misplaced (all the stuff about state sovereignty and separation of power.) Thus, this section should include the text and one paragraph of context.

6) THE ARTICLES: Pedantic, but I don't think the powers need to be bookended by their respective articles. The heading should be a summary of the article alone (i.e. Legislative power).

a) LEGISLATIVE - many errors here. There is no debate (in the law) as to whether the powers listed are "enumerated." The sentencing following this assertion, to me, is incomprehensible. Further, McCullough v. Maryland held that, when exercising an enumerated power (in this case creating a national bank through the "necessary and proper" clause), the "supremacy clause" means that Congress' power, in that case, trumps state power. So, perhaps, McCullough could be cited for the proposition that enumerated powers include the "necessary and proper" clause, or there could be a link for a page on that extremely important case. Finally, the sentence about "free debate" doesn't seem to really provide any understanding of the "speech and debate clause" and I don't understand the assertion about the limit on "self-serving" behavior. Also, should be expanded to mention, among others, prohibition against titles of nobility, habeas corpus, ex post facto, etc.

b) EXECUTIVE - this needs to be clarified and expanded. It is misleading to equate the Executive Branch with "the Presidency." Also, the discussion of succession and the 25th A, I think, is one of the least important and interesting elements for the purposes of the main article.

c) JUDICIAL - again, clarify and expand. Main point is jurisdiction and the fact that the only Federal Court required by the constitution is the Supreme Court.

d) STATES POWERS - this one is pretty good but needs some editing and controlling idea (I.e. "federalism.")

e) PROCESS OF AMENDMENT: - again, pretty good, but needs some editing and controlling idea of "elasticity." (This is part of the original genius, after all, of this document). Stylistic note, there seem to be uses of obsolete words like "lest" and "amongst." Perhaps that's what happens when you read too much Madison but let's save them for the quotes.

I'm skipping, now, to:

f) Provision for amendment: I think this should be moved to e), and get rid of the "some people feel demographic changes..." etc. If you want to get into this legitimate debate, should be a separate article and requires attribution.

Also, should move the MARBURY discussion to a concluding paragraph, perhaps, entitled "Constitutional Law." More to be said about the amendments but have to go, now.

== Current Status of the Constitution ==

There needs to be some reference in the article to the actual current status of the Constitution, and particularly the Bill of Rights - not just their official or symbolic status.  The lead defines it as the supreme law in the United States, but there is overwhelming scholarship and documentary evidence disputing that that is factually the case under present circumstances.  Without any mention of the secret courts, kidnappings, torture, partial consolidation of branches, and unlimited search and seizure powers currently practiced by elements of the US government, the page is incomplete and anachronistic.  [[User:Wercloud|Wercloud]] 02:56, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

I think you are confusing "de jure" and "de facto." The US CONSTITUTION is the supreme law of the United States. About that, there is no controversy. The question is, is it being actually followed by the powers it attempts to restrict? There have been many constitutional crises over the course of American History and the document's epitaph has been written many times. Whether the current crisis (and I believe the evidence shows we are indeed in the middle of one) turns out to be the last, we don't know yet. So, until we do, I think the main article must restrict itself to the text as much as possible with a link, perhaps, to "Constitutional Crises" that can discuss MARBURY, MCCULLOUGH, THE CIVIL WAR, THE NEW DEAL, US V. NIXON and, yes, the present. --[[User:Sobeast|Sobeast]] 23:37, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

==San Marino/Medina==
I have removed the following text from the lead:
:The U.S. Constitution is argued by many to be the oldest written democratic national constitution, ''however [[San Marino]]'s [[Constitution of San Marino#The Statutes of 1600|Statutes of 1600]] and the [[Constitution of Medina]] written in 622 by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] are contenders. San Marino's constitution's status as a true constitution is disputed by scholars.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:United_States_Constitution Under "San Marino? not"<!-- link to a wiki talk-page is not a reliable resource--></ref>''

One, this is in the Lead, which is a summary, not for detailed arguments. Two, there are no direct sources, just a disputed link to antoher internal article on San Marino. Three, it what fantasyland is the [[Constitution of Medina]] considered democratic, especially as it was written and imposed by one person? I find NO mention of it being that in the article on the document, much less a source to back up the claim.

I have no problem with the section being elsewhere in the article, provided it has proper, direct sources to back up its claims. - [[User:BillCJ|BillCJ]] 17:17, 13 September 2007 (UTC)

== Is it really a "law"? ==

Quick jurisprudential question from an English lawyer and complete novice in all matters relating to the US Constitution. The article refers to the Constitution as "the supreme law" of the US. My question is this: is it correct to call it a law? Yes, the legality of all laws in the US flows from the Constitution but is it itself a law? Thanks. --[[User:Ukexpat|ukexpat]] 17:17, 17 September 2007 (UTC)
*Well the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the US Constitution states:
{{blockquote|This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.}}
Thus, by definition, the US Constitution is the "supreme law" and therefore can be called law.  --[[User:CapitalR|CapitalR]] 17:23, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

Speaking from a strictly amateur viewpoint, I am not sure that one in normal parlance refers to the Constitution as "the law".  In more modern grasp, a law is a rule based upon the guarantees and enumerated powers of the Constitution.  For example I don't think one would refer to "free speech" as a law .... though there are many laws that are in place to either protect or limit it.  As a matter of fact, if you read many of hte more modern ammendments, the last part of them usually states something to the effect of "Congress is authorized to pass any law necesary to properly enforce this" .... or something or other. Just an amateur opinion. [[User:LonelyBeacon|LonelyBeacon]] 17:32, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

==Influence of the Fuero de León==

The Spanish Parliament of the Kingdom of León (1188) was the first sample of modern parliamentarism in Western Europe's History.

After coming to the power, the King Alfonso IX, before the situation of crisis of Kingdom of León, attacked by their two neighbors, Castile and Portugal, he decided to summon the "Royal Curia".

This one was a medieval organisation composed by aristocrats and bishops. But, because of the gravity of the situation and ready to assemble the maximum political support, the king Alfonso IX took a revolutionary decision: he called the representatives of the urban middle class of the most important cities and assembled them with the nobility and the Church in "Cortes" or Parliament. For the first time since the Ancient Greece, not only the nobility and the Church were taking part in the elaboration of the laws of a country.

León's Parliament approached topics that today are the base of the juridical classification of any democratic state: the limits of the executive power, the defense of the citizen opposite to the power public and deprived of the epoch and especially, the cleanliness of the judicial processes.

In this respect it is necessary to to emphasize the right to the private property, the resource to being able to come to the Justice opposite to the King, the obligation of the King to consult to the Parliament to enter war, the "habeas corpus" and the inviolability of the domicile.

From León's Parliament, Europe's numerous kingdoms assembled parliaments with participation of the cities: England, Catalonia, Aragón, Valencia.

When the Founding Fathers of the United States of America elaborated the American constitution, one of the juridical models who studied they were the laws arisen from the parliament of the Kingdom of León.John Adams known the text of the Fuero of León in his travel to Spain, as it's related in his biography.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:José-Vicente Álvarez|José-Vicente Álvarez]] ([[User talk:José-Vicente Álvarez|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/José-Vicente Álvarez|contribs]]) 18:11, 27 September 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:The unrefereced item added earler this week to the article claimed that Thomas Jefferson traveled Europe to do research for the US Constitution, and was influenced by the Leon Parliament. Now it's John Adams! The framing of the Constitution is well-documented by the framers themselves, and other writers of the time, and has been well researched since then. Therefore, I don't think it's unresonable to require a direct referece to the influence, not just inference.

== Typo in constitution ==

:The "typo" argument questions the [[Takings Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. However, it is an pointless argument since "...public use without just compensation." and "...public use, without just compensation." mean the same thing. Political groups can argue it all they want to justify whichever side of the argument they are on regarding the Takings Clause, but legally it holds no relevance in the sense that it would not change any legal doctrine. As such, no, I do not believe it belongs in an article about the US Constitution. You may feel free to write a separate article and add it to a further reading section (or more appropriately under a "conspiracy theories and other pointless arguments" section, no offense intended), but it will do nothing to benefit the reader who is trying to learn about the constitution.

==1 Article Per Clause?==
I have noted that there is an ongoing trend for creating a separate article for enormous numbers of clauses in the Constitution. For example, we have articles on Wikipedia for the Fugitive Slave Clause, the Origination Clause, and the Postal Clause. I question this practice and think we need to be more deliberate about how we are managing this. I see at least two issues with this:

1. These clauses don't have standardized names, unless they are so notable that there is no doubt there ''should'' be a separate article. Examples of clauses for which there is no real dispute might be the Commerce, Due Process, Equal Protection, Free Exercise, Establishment, and Supremacy Clauses. For the rest, everybody just makes up a name for the clause that fits their needs; for example, what we're calling the "Postal Clause" could just as easily (and probably has been) called the "Post Office Clause," and the "Taxing & Spending Clause" has what seems like about a half-dozen names. They can't even always agree on spelling when they know the word they want; depending on who you ask, you can hear about the Guaranty or Guarantee Clause.

2. Nobody in American history has turned to an encyclopedia and said "I'd like to look up and learn more about the Postal Clause." Doing this risks making our treatment of the bits of the Constitution fragmented and disorganized. It also risks giving non-lawyers the impression that it is typical to break the document down to that level of specificity. 

I'm looking to develop some consensus on how to handle this. [[User:MrArticleOne|MrArticleOne]] ([[User talk:MrArticleOne|talk]]) 02:17, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

:I'm of the opinion that one of the unique benefits of an online source such as Wikipedia is that there is no space limitation barring us from having separate articles on, for instance, every clause in the US Constitution, while paper encyclopedias would have such a limitation. This allows us to go in great depth about a huge amount of topics. However, as complexity increases, so must our organization. I vehemently disagree with the notion (not that you're advocating it) that we should limit the amount of information in Wikipedia because it would be difficult to organize it all. That said, for this topic, perhaps we could include a bulleted list (or something similar) with (1) what we at Wikipedia have decided we will call each clause; (2) a short listing of other common names, if any, for the same clause; and (3) a quite short description of the clause itself, that is, what the clause does in the Constitutional context. That would likely go a long way in solving the issue of naming the clause. (Yes, I know that a list of clauses exists in the US Constitution template at the bottom of the article, and it should stay, but it doesn't go far enough for this purpose).

:As for your second point, I think that we shouldn't refrain from making articles because we feel they may be useless. Indeed, if a topic such as the Postal Clause were uselessly specific and obscure, no one would have made the article in the first place. That someone decided to make it implies heavily that someone else will benefit from its existence. [[User:Vbdrummer0|Vbdrummer0]] ([[User talk:Vbdrummer0|talk]]) 03:09, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
::My disagreement with your position is that creating an article for a topic communicates certain information about it; it suggests that the subject is sufficiently notable to have an article written about it. You don't feel that we should limit the amount of information in Wikipedia because it would be difficult to organize it all, but I know I for one don't deserve to have an article about me, personally, in the project, since I am not sufficiently notable ''and creating one would suggest that I am''. Creating separate articles for obscure clauses of the Constitution is not exactly analogous, but too similar for me to be satisfied with it. For a clause with next-to-nothing to be said about it, the ''same information'' can be presented in a fashion that is closer the clause's significance at the article for the Article of the Constitution it is in.

There may be others that I am not thinking of immediately. I am just as certain that the so-called "Territorial Clause" does not.

For example, you note that the so-called Territorial Clause "has been used to justify giving Article III powers to Article I courts in the territories." Your phrasing indicates my concern: "has been used to justify." To me, that sounds like this is not really what you'd call "Territorial Clause doctrine," but a decision ''justified'' by it (probably a decision they would have reached on other grounds in the absence of the clause). Making an article and talking about that decision in the article suggests that the Constitutional provision had more significance in the decision than it did. I should note that I think this is a problem with Wikipedia generally; in the interests of completeness I do not feel that we always effectively communicate the significance of exceptions/alternatives/unusual situations on a variety of topics.

== Capitalization of "President" ==

The text of the constitution appears to be consistently using "President" (leading caps) when referring to the position, e.g., quoting from [http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html NARA]:
{{quote|Article. II.

Section. 1.

The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:}}
however [[User:Dkempton74]] appears to be singling out that term to lowercase it.  Reviewing the bottom of the edit, I do see in the second amendment that "People" is not capitalized on NARA, but my attention was on the "President".  The effect of the edit is to leave other branches of government with leading caps but not for the president.

== Child labor amendment text. ==

The section on the child labor amendment says

A child labor amendment proposed by the 68th Congress on June 2, 1924, which stipulates: "The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age." T'''his amendment is now moot, since subsequent federal child labor laws have uniformly been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress' powers under the commerce clause.''' This amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. It may yet be ratified.

The bolded part (my bolding) makes no sense to me.  If the point of this amendment is to forbid the government from having power over child labor, how does existing child labor laws affect that?  A constitutional amendment supersedes a court decision and/or a federal law.[[User:Bonewah|Bonewah]] ([[User talk:Bonewah|talk]]) 21:16, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

:::There's more to your argument, and merit on all sides of this. I've been listening to college lectures from the Teaching Company, and the gist of what I'm learning is that the Federalists essentially won the battle to write the Constitution. It has their agenda all over it. The not-insignificant contribution by the anti-federalists was the Bill of Rights. But essentially the Constitution steered the country in a direction headed towards business and prosperity and national wealth. Things like citizenship and states' rights got lost down the way.

:::::::The battle to define the United States as essentially a commercial republic. The Federalists won out. The anti-federalists lost (except for important Bill of Rights -- helpful mostly in the twentieth century). In a way, the US could have been defined as a workers' republic or as a pure democracy or some other variant; but these options were not chosen. If one sees politics like Aristotle or Machiavelli as a battle of haves versus have-nots, the Federalists were haves (property rights, rights to hire and fire, ownership, sanctity of contracts etc) and they essentially steered the nation in a path towards prosperity and commerce. At the same time, the nation cycles between both types of approaches -- between capitalism and socialism, between owners and workers. But it's essential trajectory was in a capitalist direction. For example, there was little mention of the concept of "citizenship" in the Constitution -- who were citizens? did they have any duties or rights or powers? And the government was structured in a way to thwart popular will. Only one branch represented the people directly -- the Congress -- and it too was checked by the Senate. The other branches -- Judiciary, presidency -- essentially aristocratically oriented, or oriented towards the legal professions or propertied interests. I'm not saying that this was a bad thing; but overall choices were made back then. The Constitution narrowly passed in states such as New York, Massachusetts. Only a handful of votes, if they had changed in NY, would have changed things considerably.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 04:55, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

::::::::That's very interesting, yet it seems to have worked in spite of the negative attributes that you believe exist; and for much longer than any other constitution of a country of similar scale. If NY hadn't ratified then what? It was the 11th state to ratify, therefore the Constitution was already in affect by that time. --[[User:The Founders Intent|<font color="green">'''''T<small>HE</small> F<small>OUNDERS</small> I<small>NTENT </small>'''''</font>]]<sup>[[User talk:The Founders Intent|''PRAISE'']]</sup>  12:45, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

::::::::::Yes I agree the Constitution worked despite problems, and it has persisted for several centuries. Many pluses to the arrangement -- political stability is highly important for successful economies. Balance of power, checks & balances within government prevents tyranny. It's a brilliant system to keep ambitious people fighting other ambitious people. The legal sense of citizenship has expanded to bring in more people for effective participation (blacks, women, etc). About NY state -- yes it ratified after the supposed 9-needed marker was passed; yet NY State was one of the four big ones (Mass, Pennsylvania, Virginia were the others) and the Framers strongly felt that if NY hadn't ratified, that the Constitution would still have been in trouble, although of course it's impossible to say how things might have played out otherwise. Still, there are serious weaknesses in the system in my view, requiring serious reform. I've written about them elsewhere in detail, but include issues such as foreign policy, citizenship, balance of power between states & federal government, as well as numerous smaller flaws highlighted by constitutional scholars such as Sanford Levinson (eg DC residents lack representation, disproportionate power of rural states in the Senate, unspecified succession if there was a catastrophic attack on Congress, etc etc). Generally most democracies around the world favor the parliamentary approach (legislature chooses executive ministers) and these seem to work better than ours, in which the judiciary checks (or tries to check -- it's slow, needs court cases to bubble up, etc) the executive. But the biggest reason to have a Second Constitutional Convention, in my view (definitely POV) is that the US won't be able to adequately cope with the problem of terrorism; I argue this [http://knol.google.com/k/thomas-sulcer/common-sense-ii-part-1-of-2/38jyd65oa42fm/4# here] in an essay, but there is little chance that any of these reforms might be taken seriously. If there ''was'' a Constitutional Convention, the trick would be keeping the amazing good stuff while adapting it to meet 21st century problems -- definitely a tough intellectual exercise.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:57, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

::::::The Constitution as defining a commercial republic is at the root of Charles Beard's analysis of the US Constitution, but historians since Beard wrote almost a century ago have unhinged some of his key conclusions.  Beard took the approach of looking for certain specific interests in the personal lives and finances of the participants at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, but later scholars revealed that this was overly simplistic - many of the people Beard identified as have commercial mercantile concerns actually acted against those interests in their actions on the floor of the Convention.  Ideology motivated the Founders more than practical or commercial interests, something that is well-proven in the works of the historian Gordon S. Wood and others since.  The reasons the US Constitution was adopted to replace the Articles of Confederation was the failure of the Articles themselves, specifically the failure of the idea of the loose league of sovereign States.  Crises like Shay's Rebellion, economic dislocation, and the sense of lost momentum from the ideals of the Revolution, as well as the paralysis enforced by the requirements for supermajorities and unanimity under the Articles drove the rather desperate decision to start over with a completely new constitution - and then only after the previous convention, which sought to find solutions for just the economic issues, failed.

::::::A side note on New York - the ratification of the Constitution by the State of New York was crucial, because without its ratification the reorganized USA could have been cut into sections.  The threatened secession of New York City from the State forced the issue, one of several less-than-ideal solutions triggering the controversial ratification of a new Constitution whose adoption process violated the terms of the active constitution (the Articles of Confederation).  The longest resistance came from RI, which finally yielded for reasons similar to New York.

::::::To understand the Founders' actions one has to understand their ideologies, specifically that they were acting in defense of something modern historians call the "republican ideal."  This, briefly simplified, was the idea that a free republic with neither hereditary aristocracy nor monarchy had to have at the core of its decision-making process men of independent means whom the Founders believed could set aside their personal interests and make rational, reasonable decisions for the republic as a whole.  Such "republicans" would not be corrupt, the Founders believed, nor skew the decisions of the Republic toward their own interests, because they already had resources such that they wanted for nothing.  These men would be not only the elected officials and administrators of the republic, but also the voters themselves - and all other citizens and non-citizens who had lesser resources were expected to accept the decisions of these "wise electors" as a part of the ideals in question.  They had no intention of creating universal suffrage democracy, and no intention of seeing to the needs of ordinary people beyond freedom and basic protections - in a very real sense there was no chance of a government set up in 1787 and 1788 which ended slavery, or enfranchised women (whom this ideal rejected as electors or leaders), or created a focus on ordinary workers.  The men who had grown up under an 18th century aristocratic monarchy were being radical simply by rejecting the idea that some men were born better than others, and opening the doors of leadership and decision to anyone who could prove their worth through the successful amassing of resources sufficient to want for nothing - what was called a "competency."

::::::Once one understands the ideological foundations of the Revolution and the men who fought it and drafted both the Articles and the Constitution, the Preamble makes more sense.  Yes, they were a narrow group of elites.  Yes, they had very limited connections to the people as a whole.  But, yes, indeed, they believed they were acting on behalf of and in the name of the people of America as a whole - because that was the idea at the root of "res publica," for the public, for the people - the root of republic.  The kingdom they had overthrown in their lands had seen the sovereign as a single person and the nation as existing to benefit that single person.  The republic they founded saw all the people of America as the sovereign, and thus the nation as a whole existed to benefit the people of America as a whole.  To these men and their ideology, the men of means made decision to benefit all the people in the name of the people - and this was neither a contradiction nor an affectation.  They were deadly serious about it.

::::::Again, for references on this ideology look to the works of Wood, Bailyn, and others who followed the remarkable discoveries uncovered in the detailed analysis of the popular debates before, during, and after the Revolution.

::::::As for constitutional function, I would argue that the US Constitution and the division of power has worked better longer than a Westminster system of unitary parliament combined with executive.  SCOTUS and the federal judiciary have pushed back against unconstitutional excesses time and again, most notably in the 1860s, the 1930s, the 1950s, and again in the past few years.  Additionally, the independent Congress has done a better job of keeping presidents in check that many Westminster parliaments have done with prime ministers because the Congress does not have to be under the majority control of the political party of the executive.  Divided government - where Congress is in one party's hands or divided, and the presidency is in another - have done more to preserve constitutional balance and individual freedom than any other output of the US Constitution over the last three decades.

::::::As to a new constitutional convention - ironically, Beard drafted his erroneous theory of the economic underpinnings of the US Constitution during a period when agitation for an Article V Convention was at its height over the issue of direct election of Senators.  Congress blinked in that stand-off, choosing to surrender the isolation of Senators rather than face the prospect of a convention convened under the US Constitution's Article V guidelines, which might change all manner of things in the amendments it proposed to the States for ratification.  Yet we stand very close to this period again on the issue of a balanced budget amendment - by most counts, only two more States need send their demand for an Article V Convention on the question of balanced budgets to the US Congress before the operative language (which is imperative, not discretionary) in Article V is activated.  While such a convention, constituted under the US Constitution, would be bound to retain the US Constitution, its purview would be wide open - everything except the equal representation of the States in the Senate can be amended under the terms of Article V.  I strongly suspect that as the questions of sovereign debt and international finance grow more acute in the decade ahead, the last two States necessary may act - and we may yet have another Constitutional Convention.

::::::As for the question of reacting to terrorism, (herein is my POV) the American people may simply need to accept that to retain the freedoms and civil liberties that are their birthright, they must accept the risk of terrible outcomes at the hands of terrorists.  It is almost impossible to secure a free society against the monstrous actions of one or a few people within it without completely destroying freedom.  I'd be happy to discuss these issues - Article V Conventions, security versus freedom in the age of terrorism - on my talk page or yours, which ever you might prefer.

==world's oldest federal constitution==
The US Constitution is NOT the oldest written constitution; it's not even ''our'' oldest written constitution.  At federal level, it was preceded by the first American constitution, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.  Otherwise, the first written American constitution was the Mayflower Compact; and the first American constitution that is still in force today is the Vermont Constitution, which pre-dates the U.S. Constitution by a few years.

Internationally, the oldest written constitution is the Constitution of the Most Serene Republic of San Marino; which has the distinction of being the world's oldest, if not first, republic.

BTW, a federal constitution does not necessarily provide for a federal system in which govenment power is "spread between the national, state and local governments."  We have no "national" government in the United States.  We have a federal government that operates nationally within the limited sovereignty granted it by the US Constitution - under which document the basic unit of American government is the individual state, not the federal state.  (Conversely, the basic unit of government in Canada is the federal state, not the provincial state.)

Rather, a federal constitution is a constitution (oral and/or written) which governs the operation of a federal state, as opposed to a unitary state.  A federal state is a nation-state composed of constituent unitary or federal nation-states, each of which is endowed with its own sovereignty - except to the extent its sovereignty is assigned or assumed by the federal constitution to the federal state.  A unitary state, by comparison, is a single sovereign entity with unlimited jurisdiction over all inferior jurisdictions within its borders.

== Ratification ==

The article [[United_States_Constitution#Ratification|states]] "they decided only nine states were needed to ratify the constitution for it to go into effect." How could they just decide that, given that at this time the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, which required unanimity? Seems this should be explained in the text. --[[User:KarlFrei|KarlFrei]] ([[User talk:KarlFrei|talk]]) 11:34, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

== Amerocentrism and the absence of any discussion of the document's international impact ==

I'll say this right off the bat: The article on the whole should, as it currently does, have a strong primary focus on the document's own history, its historical impact in the United States, and the language therein. That said, the document has had a strong impact on other similar documents. The Japanese Constitution (drafted during post-war occupation), for instance, was said to be closely modeled on it. It is difficult to believe that the United States Constitution did not have some sort of measurable and noteworthy impact on others, as well. While it is commendable that previous editors of this document have included mention of international documents that preceded it, more detailed discussion of its impact on documents that followed should be added to make the article more relevant and accessible to an international audience.

:While this debate is interesting, we should remove the worldwide view tag from the top of the page I think.

== Recent Edit To Second Amendment Section is in error ==

Entry for Second Amendment previously said "defines the right of individuals to possess firearms."

This is exactly consistent with the recent Supreme Court case District of Columbia v Heller, and is a correct statement of the law.

Feb 3 it was changed to its current revision, "A heavily debated amendment from which the people derive a right to bear arms."

Unfortunately this is not an improvement.  It replaces a plain statement of the law and substitutes something amnbiguous which does no explanatory work.  Also, many of the provisions of the bill of rights are heavily debated.  Adding it here doesn't really have much meaning and in fact incorrectly suggests that this is the only provision that is heavily debated when in fact there are regular heavy debates over the scope of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth amendments just to name a few.

Also, the word "derive" should not be used.  The framers were clear that the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are not derived from the Constitution but are a priori rights not dependent on the government but are inherent (and unalienable).  So the Bill of Rights guarantees preexisting rights.  It does not grant rights.

Someone should revert the Second Amendment entry to "defines the right of individuals to possess firearms."

Thank you.

UPDATE:  WAS ABLE TO MAKE EDIT MYSELF.  REVERTED BACK TO PREVIOUS EXCEPT I SUBSTITUED "GUARANTEES" FOR "DEFINES."  THANKS.

== Major misconception  ==

The article '''United States Constitution''' perpetuates a mistaken view of the US Congress. The article says "Article One describes the congress, the legislative branch of the federal government. The United States Congress is a bicameral body consisting of the '''lower house of the House of Representatives and the Senate as the upper house'''."

There is nothing in Article One that says there is any such relationship between the two institutions.

[[User:Cluckk2|Cluckk2]] ([[User talk:Cluckk2|talk]]) 13:43, 6 March 2009 (UTC)
:The terms upper and lower house are not meant to indicate rank or superiority/inferiority. The House of Representatives is closer to the people than the Senate; therefore, it is lower. This is demonstrated by the following: all representatives are elected every two years and senators every six years; Senators were originally picked by the state legislatures and still are considered the representatives of the states, not the people. This balances the interests of the states and the interests of the populace, by giving the people power to  change their representatives quickly while the states, represented by the longer term Senators, should act as a brake to hasty changes. Unfortunately, the XVII Amendment did away with this. We see that in some actions the house has more power and in others it is the Senate. Appropriations bills must originate in the House because the people have the greatest say in taxation; the Senate alone ratifies treaties because the federal government in foreign relations is acting on behalf of the combined states.
==ERA==

The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] should be placed in a third category as, technically, it is not known (and will not be known until legal action or ratification attempts) whether the 35 ratifications are still valid (see "Three State Strategy" in the ERA's article).  Unlike with most of the other amendments, ERA still has active groups lobbying for it in the remaining states and has as recently as winter 2009 been subject to a ratification vote (in [[Arkansas]], which resulted in a tie). There should at least be a mention that ratification efforts are still around. [[User:SocialActivismNow|SocialActivismNow]] ([[User talk:SocialActivismNow|talk]]) 20:02, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

==Introduction re legal authority provided==
The second sentence of the article says:
"It is the foundation and source of the legal authority underlying the existence of the United States of America; the Federal Government of the United States; and all the State & local governments and Territorial Administrative bodies contained therein."

The first two items in that list are correct. The third is absolutely wrong. The states do NOT derive their power from the federal constitution. How could they when they preceded its existence? (unless the ratification of the federal constitution constituted a simultaneous bloodless revolution in the various states, which I've never heard anyone suggest.) This is what sets a federal system apart from a unitary one. See the paragraph beginning "Rather, a federal constitution is..." in the section "World's oldest federal constitution" above. I couldn't say it better, so I won't try.

I'm removing the third item from that list. Looking at what's left, the phrase "...foundation and source of the legal authority underlying the existence..." seems really odd to me. I can't put my finger on the reason why.
What do people think of this as a syntactically simpler and, I feel, clearer replacement for that whole sentence:
"It establishes the United States of America as a nation-state and the legal authority of the Federal Government of the United States."
(Note that to say it establishes the USA as a nation-state is not in conflict with the existence of the USA under the Articles of Confederation. It establishes the USA in an ongoing sense.)
It's important that the nature of the States' sovereignties be discussed, but correctly, and due to the nuance, probably not in the introduction.

"(A little known fact is that) The Greek War of Independence of 1821 (against the Ottoman Empire) inflamed the imagination of leading American political figures who caught "Greek Fever". This revolt parallels the American Revolution and brings parallels between March 25th and the Fourth of July. Thomas Jefferson , author of the Declaration of Independence, had extensive correspondence regarding the principles of democratic government with Adamantios Korais, one of the intellectual fathers of the Greek Revolution. President James Madison, major author of the American Constitution, and President James Monroe supported the (Greek) revolt in private correspondence and in public speeches. Prominent politicians such as Daniel Webster, Sam Houston, and Henry Clay championed Greece on the floor of the United States Senate. the Greek War of Independence would produce an abundance of heroes, traitors, massacres, and foreign interventions. In that regard, the Greek War of Independence again parallels the history of the American Revolution. A significant percent of American colonists remained loyal to the British monarch and lived comfortably while Washington's famished troops shivered in their winter camps. Washington himself was a target of conpiracy of other generals who wanted to replace him as commander-in-chief. Due to related quarrels with General Gates, Benedict Arnold, the leader of the American victory at the crucial battle of Saratoga, eventually deserted to the British side. The climatic battle of Yorktown was achieved only with the assistance of the French Navy.

Similar patterns formed during the Greek Revolution. At one point General Theodoros Kolokotronis was actually jailed by political rivals. Co-ordination between Greek land and sea forces was weak. Some Greeks remained loyal to the Sultan; and Greece's European Allies did not wish to see a full-fledged democracy emerge from the conflict. Thus, the revolution that began as the new cutting edge of democracy forged the spirit of the French Enlightenment ultimately was forced by Britain, France, and Russia to accept the son of a Bavarian aristocrat as its constitutional monarch. The Sultan also had powerful allies such as Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. Pasha, in fact, would continue the fight against the Greeks after the Sultan's own forces were defeated.

The most famous American poet of the time, William Cullen Bryant, wrote on behalf of the Greeks, and hundreds of poems, editorials and news stories by less famous persons appeared throughout the national press. Cities such as Ypsilanti, Michigan, were named after heroes of the revolution, and numerous state assemblies towns, and colleges passed resolutions in support of the Greek cause. Funds were raised to aid the Greeks, and American volunteers journeyed across the Atlantic to fight alongside the Greeks. The sculptor Hiram Walker created 'The Greek Slave' a mournful marble statue that depicted a Greek woman enslaved by the Ottomans."

Article Seven sets forth the requirements for [[ratification]] of the Constitution.

==The oldest constitution in the world?==

Is it the oldest constitution? The one of the Republic of San Marino is more than 150 years older (and is still in use - [[San_Marino]], 9th row). Taking in consider that the article says "It is the shortest and oldest written constitution of any major sovereign state", which is a somewhat misleading phrase due to the word "major".

:I think the wording is fair.. San Marino being a micronation and whatnot. If you'd want to get all technical (and I guess we ought to be precise), one might finish the sentence "...of any major sovereign state, predated only by the [[Constitution of San Marino]] of 1600." ...or are there any other constitutions of "non-major" countries also predating the US constitution?
:Also, now that I think about it, is the US constitution the oldest, or the oldest ''still in effect''? I would assume the latter, but the wording suggests otherwise. Might need to rewrite that sentence if that's the case. [[Special:Contributions/78.34.118.113|78.34.118.113]] ([[User talk:78.34.118.113|talk]]) 21:06, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


I agree also with you. The oldest constitution is the one in San Marino. Even if it is a little country, the information should be quote.  The USA don't have the oldest constitution of the World.

::So, why no changes yet to the wording of the article in this matter?  Also, why does the size of the state having the constitution matter?  Suppose Costa Rica's constitution was older than China's (I'm not sure of the age of either).  Would Costa Rica's prominence in world affairs be a relevant factor in determining whose constitution was oldest?  Of course not.  So why is it relevant in the case of the US vs. San Marino?

:::Because what is alleged above is not true. San Marino does not have a written constitution. Parts of its constitution are written, but that is not the same thing. By the logic alleging that San Marino has the oldest written constitution, one would have to say Britain has the oldest written constitution because of Magna Carta (1215).

== Explanation of self revert ==

Earlier today, [[User:Broadcaster101]] made several edits to the Amendments section. As best I can figure (it being many hours later) I clicked "undo" from the diff instead of "edit", and managed not to notice any of the clear indicators that would have told me I was editing in an undo edit window instead of the regular one. How I missed the filled in edit summary is especially confusing, but I guess I must have cleared it when I wasn't paying attention. Not paying attention is obviously a big part of this. In any event, I made my relatively minor change ("''Marbury v. Madison'' (1803)" to "the 1803 case ''Marbury v. Madison''"). Later, I noticed my mistake when I saw that Broadcaster was making an edit I had already seen him make with only me in between. I apologize, and I believe I've fixed it.

What matters here is how we use the term ''Constitution'' -- are we talking about a living, breathing, changing covenant between government and the people? Or are we talking about a fixed historical document from 1789? This matters -- my sense is this article is mostly about the historical document, and doesn't cover how two centuries of fundamental changes. For example, according to the historical Constitution, Congress declares war; but the essential understanding is that today, war is something the president determines (every war after WW2 has been essentially a presidential decision, although sometimes ratified by Congress.) So I think a big problem with this article is -- identifying that this article's emphasis is on the historical fixed document.--

::::Perhaps I didn't say it clearly, but I'm not talking about the generic term "Constitution". Rather, when people today talk about the United States Constitution, it can have different meanings. One sense is the original 1787 document, strictly construed. Another sense of the US Constitution is like a "living, breathing, changing" compact which has gone through various transformations, understandings; in this sense the current US "Constitution" is different than the 1787 Constitution. Different writers (often depending on one's political affiliation) tend to go with one or the other version of this.

I find this need to criticize the Constitution somewhat problematic.  Is there a section praising the Constitution?  Who is currently praising the Constitution?  Look at the section on criticisms, one person doesn't seem to like anything about it.  According to one Yale professor, "unusual and potentially undemocratic: the federal system, the bicameral legislature, judicial review, presidentialism, and the electoral college system.", it appears that almost everything is bad.  He believes the Founders were profoundly ignorant of the future.  How unprofound a conclusion is that?  Who knows the future?  Frankly I think the man misses the real genius of the Constitution; and that is that it wasn't written for a certain time, but for all time.  Why, because the Founders understood the nature of ''men''.  Throughout history the nature of man hasn't changed, the selfishness, the ego, the tendency for corruption are all the same; always have been and always will be.  With due respect to his prominence as a political scientist, it's frightening that his pessemistic opinions take up so much space in this article.  Considering that the US is relatively young, with one of the oldest governments, I'd say his pessimism is unfounded.  Notwithstanding this section of the article is hardly balanced.  It's needs counterpoints.  --[[User:The Founders Intent|<font color="green">'''''T<small>HE</small> F<small>OUNDERS</small> I<small>NTENT </small>'''''</font>]]<sup>[[User talk:The Founders Intent|''PRAISE'']]</sup> 13:00, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

:I think there should be [[WP:BALANCE]] and [[WP:NPOV]] to all articles, including one about the US Constitution. Microsoft has a criticism section; this article needs one too. The general pattern for Americans seems to be to revere the Constitution -- not to question it; today in America I think there is very little political debate, with Americans essentially divorced from politics. I think the press understands, perhaps better than the public, that there are serious problems with American government, including rampant partisanship, corruption, unbalanced power (President too powerful, Congress weak, Supreme Court still providing some check), poor foreign policy, waste, inability to confront serious problems. And, among experts and academics looking for solutions, some blame the Constitution. These critics are prominent professors, constitutional scholars, often quoted in mainstream publications, not fringe types. And their opinions -- that the Constitution needs amendments, or should be overhauled entirely (some think this) need to be included in this article for balance. If you would like to include opinions praising the Constitution, I would welcome that too. And I agree there are some excellent parts of the current Constitution that have worked brilliantly, like you say, and most of the professors in the criticism section will probably agree with you about that; what they're saying, however, is that there are serious problems which need attention.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 14:14, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

::I see you have a passion for this topic, however I caution against arbitrary changes to the Constitution.  The biases during the original establishment of it were undoubtedly strong.  However, the bias toward the affection for other types of government that has crept into our politics and many in academia causes me great concern were they to have a prominent say in affecting great changes to our founding document.  I don't trust them.  Minor changes can have lasting and adverse affects on the function of the Constitution.  It is difficult to believe that future amendments will benefit the people, or correct the failures to limit the boundaries of the federal government.  So having a dominent criticisms section should be viewed with a critical eye.  --[[User:The Founders Intent|<font color="green">'''''T<small>HE</small> F<small>OUNDERS</small> I<small>NTENT </small>'''''</font>]]<sup>[[User talk:The Founders Intent|''PRAISE'']]</sup> 14:42, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

:::I agree about the critical eye; and like you, I have a healthy skepticism on all things. But your comment seems to suggest like what appears in a Wikipedia article are actual changes to the Constitution, as if I had some power to do this. I don't, and frankly, I don't think anybody else does either, including politicians, academics, newspaper commentators, Congress, billionaires. So, if you're even slightly worried about fundamental change to the Constitution, I don't think you need bother. I don't see much change coming, and I have loads of personal experience to justify this (I think) well-informed point of view. But I agree there should possibly be more references about the good parts of the Constitution, the unseen ways in which it balances forces; the US is a great place for business, for consumers, for shopping, for workers and investors (until the financial mess of late). And while many well-informed sources suggest the presidency has pretty much taken over the government, there is some balance still with a somewhat healthy check from the judiciary.

==Preamble==

There is a problem with the section of the Preamble.  All it does is reference the opinion of Muccolch v. Maryland with "The phrase "We the People" indicates that the government of the United States "is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people," rather than a league of the states" without stating alternate opinions.  For one thing, the word people (as in the Tenth Amendment) often refers to the people of the state, therefore "We the People" can be paraphrased as "We the States."  Also, this website right here http://www.apollo3.com/~jameso/secession.html points out that originally the Preamble was going to take the states' rights position of saying "We the People of..." and then list the 13 states, but the Convention was unaware of which states would or would not ratify the Constitution, so they left it at "We the People."  [[User:Emperor001|Emperor001]] ([[User talk:Emperor001|talk]]) 05:11, 17 December 2010 (UTC)

:Actually, the intent of the Founders in drafting the Constitution was to recognize as the final sovereign authority in the American system of government the people of the nation as a whole - "We the People of the United States" - rather than any government, whether State or federal.  The Tenth Amendment refers to the people of the United States as a whole as an alternative to the States, not as a restatement - they were saying that any power not granted to the federal government was reserved either for the States or for the people of America as a whole.  The McCullough v Maryland decision is not a point of view, but rather the encapsulation of the intent of the Founders at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia - they sought to convert the failure of the Articles of Confederation, which had approached America as a league of States, into a truly unified nation through the Constitution by deriving that document's sovereign authority, and thus the sovereign authority for both the federal government and the State government, from the people of the nation as a whole rather than the States individually.  The decision to shift from Randolph's early draft to the "We the People of the United States" was not one of uncertainty about ratification prospects, but one of deliberately embracing the nationalist perspective - of a single American people in a single American nation rather than a league of states - in the wake of the stunning failure of the league approach of the Articles of Confederation.

:In essence, the Founders were successful in appealing directly to the American people to shift from one constitution (the Articles) to another (the US Constitution), which was absolutely necessary - the drafting and ratification of the US Constitution was done in a way that violated the amendation process spelled out in the Articles.  If they had not chosen to appeal to the American people as the sovereign authority even beyond the first constitution (the Articles) what they did could not have succeeded, because they never would have secured the unanimous ratification required under the Articles.

:The best accounts of this process can be found in compilations of the Founders thoughts or, alternatively, in the works of historians Gordon S. Word and Bernard Bailyn.  The information can be found in writing that's a little more accessible for non-specialist readings in some of the works of Joseph J. Ellis.  Most current textbooks on American history also touch on this process, and their bibliographies tend to be pretty thorough - I've used three different ones in courses I've taught since 2005, and they've all hit on this.  Good explications of the Maryland decision can also be found in R. Kent Newmyer's works, either on Chief Justice Marshall or Associate Justice Story if memory serves.[[User:Professor Storyteller|Professor Storyteller]] ([[User talk:Professor Storyteller|talk]]) 02:16, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

== “We the People” is not a trick. ==

BillMasen, the political participation in the US of 1780s was broader and more frequent than anywhere to that time ... The Convention recommended to Congress. Congress forwarded to the states. Each state called a ratification convention according to their own franchise. 

Delegates were elected on the ONE question of ratification. There was no trick. Again, this was the widest popular participation to the time, before Napoleon’s nation-wide referenda to become Emperor. These were trying for a republic; really. 

*In Virginia, Patrick Henry and George Mason lead the majority of Ratification Convention delegates AGAINST ratification. The Federalists, led by James Madison with such as John Marshall and “Light Horse Harry” Lee, gain a slender majority ONLY by promising a Bill of Rights to break Mason’s folks from the Henry crew. 

---Henry objected to the expression, “We the people” and sought to substitute, “We the States”  (Grigsby,  [[http://books.google.com/books?id=fEsjAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR7&lpg=PR7&dq=hugh+blair+grigsby+books&source=bl&ots=fyzVMrpsAE&sig=qEuH0prtiamNpfV8ulpH2dtkjVw&hl=en&ei=VaIMTY3vOZCqsAOh9oXPAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=hugh%20blair%20grigsby%20books&f=false |Virginia federal convention of 1788]]. 

---Madison: Who but the people can delegate powers? Who but the people have a right to form government? …  What have the State Governments to do with it? (Grigsby, p.103) 

---George Mason: The assumption of this power of laying direct taxes, does of itself, entirely change …  the States into one consolidated Government  … (they) must give way. … [[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch8s37.html  | The Founder’s Constitution]]. Ch. 8, Doc 37, 4 June 1788, Storing 5.17.1

---General “Light Horse Harry” Lee: the Constitution is submitted to the people for their consideration, because it is to operate on them if adopted... (Grigsby p.111) 

--- Henry: Have they said, ‘We the States’? … a proposal of a compact between States? If they had, this would be a confederation (like Holland). It is otherwise … the sovereignty of the States relinquished … freedom of conscience, trial by jury, liberty of the press, all immunities and franchises, all pretensions to human rights and privileges are rendered insecure, if not lost … (Grigsby, p.113) 

Well, in the event, politicians stood by their word, even for promises to political enemies. We got a Bill of Rights for the sovereign people, and the sovereignty of the States was relinquished in a new federal system which operated directly on the people. 

No tricks. Clear, publically communicated in the newspapers of the day, and voted on by representatives who returned to their communities to live among their neighbors, often to be re-elected by them to additional offices of public trust. 

As for Henry, he maintained his  concurrent citizenship in Virginia and in the United States and he remained politically active.  [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 12:29, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

::Generally I agree with above sentiments by TheVirginiaHistorian and Professor. And I agree that the current Constitution was, for the most part, decided in a legitimate way (although there were strong-arm tactics in Pennsylvania with police officers summoned to force legislators to show up to effect a quorum), and agreed that the votes were narrowly decided. I do not like the fact that the delegates to the Constitutional convention met in secret, and subverted the rules set by the Articles of Confederation calling for amendments to the Articles, rather than a wholesale revision (which is what happened). What has passed, has passed. And the current Constitution is accepted as legitimate -- that's what matters. Still, in this day and age, I see serious problems with our republic, with our democracy, with citizenship (''citizens'' have become ''consumers''), with the architecture of government (particularly problems with foreign policy). Times have changed considerably. While there are many pluses with the current Constitution, particularly an economic system which encourages wealth (which is good for polities everywhere), the flaws are dangerous enough in my view to merit serious consideration of a Second Constitutional Convention.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 16:51, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

::And here's how this view affects my ideas of how this article might be improved. I see one problem in America is that there is what may be best described as ''worship of the Constitution''. This article reflects this. It's considered sacrosanct, above reproach, as if the words of the Framers (they're called the ''Founding Fathers'' almost as if it's a religion) unquestionable and marked by timeless wisdom. Numerous critics have written about this constitutional worship. My sense of how this article should progress is to include more focus on this problem of constitutional worship as well as more facts and criticisms which might hopefully help people reach a better understanding of what it really is.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 16:56, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

:::Tomwsulcer - I disagree with you on flaws in the Constitution.  While they do exist, I don't believe they are serious enough to merit replacement, as the flaws I see can easily be remedied with simple amendation, though an Article V Convention for that purpose might help us get around one of the biggest issues with Congress today - the filibuster and other supermajority requirements not spelled out in the Constitution.

:::As to your idea for change to the article - one of the central characteristics of American culture (and nation-building) is the embrace of the Constitution as sacrosanct.  If we did not, we might well have no firewall against attempts to steal freedom in the name of various allegedly good causes - only the instinctive reverence of the American people for their Constitution overcomes the manipulation so many might otherwise fall prey to.  Yet this sense of sacrosanct Constitution can exist side-by-side with an appreciation of its flaws - I have both, for example.  It is not that the Constitution is sacrosanct because it is perfect, but rather because it works, and because it can be amended where problems arise.  To that end, I don't think there is any harm in pointing out issues with the Constitution - I certainly think it should be understood thoroughly and completely.  However, the document's remarkable success in protecting one of the longest runs of any free republic of citizens, and one of the largest and most diverse free republics of citizens, needs to be emphasized as well.  America, as many have observed, has benefited from great good luck since 1776. Yet it has also benefited from a document that, while far from perfect, has been good enough to survive, provide a touchstone for the defense of freedom, and yet be flexible enough to adapt from the time of powdered wigs to the time of the internet.  We should continue to recognize that.[[User:Professor Storyteller|Professor Storyteller]] ([[User talk:Professor Storyteller|talk]]) 19:16, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

::::I respectfully disagree with Professor Storyteller. I agree that the Constitution has generally done an adequate job of getting the nation to this point, although in the past century it has been increasingly ineffective in my view. I don't think it will serve the nation well in the future, but if it's revised substantially, that sufficient care should be taken to make sure it's revised well (there's a risk any new constitution could be worse). The following section delineates a list of problems; the numbered ones are from Constitutional scholars such as [[Sanford Levinson]] and others. But the bigger flaws, in my view, are structural in nature. (continued in next section) [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)
==Problems with the Constitution==
(continuation but new section for easier editing)

1) Awkward transition between presidents; from election day to the inauguration of the next president, there are effectively two presidents -- one in office, one awaiting office, and this allows confusion. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(2) Under-representation of voters from populous states in the Senate. When the Constitution was inaugurated, there wasn't a large disparity between large versus small states. Today, the population ratios between say California versus Wyoming mean that Californians are hugely underrepresented in the Senate; there is speculation that this has caused shifts of wealth from urban states to rural ones like Wyoming (eg Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska). [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(3) DC voters lack representation. A known problem for decades; why hasn't this been fixed? [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(4) Supreme Court is politicized. I don't think it does an adequate job of checking the other branches (although it's better than nothing); I agree with scholars such as Adam Tomkins that a parliamentary system does a much better job of checking the government. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(5) Original Constitution fails to include a right of privacy. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(6) Possibility of a military dictatorship should a significant terrorist attack happen such as a catastrophic attack on Congress. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(7) The Electoral college system is cumbersome and confusing. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(8) Popular election of senators. Here's a situation in which the original constitution was right in my view (letting state governments choose Senators) but it was changed by an amendment. It's important for state governments to choose Senators to give state governments a voice in the national government. My general problem here is that state governments have lost significant power to regulate their own economies, which is against the spirit of federalism. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(9) Inability to get rid of an incompetent president quickly. Examples: Wilson (suffered from an economic malady); possibly Roosevelt in last years in office; Bush (clearly incompetent choice to attack Iraq). [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(10) Life tenure for unelected Supreme Court judges. 15 or 18 year term limits would be better in my view. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

(11) The Ninth amendment has been seriously ignored. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

Many of these flaws have been cited by other constitutional scholars and there is fairly widespread agreement that they're serious and need fixing. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

To add to the list, I see serious flaws with the overall architecture of government. The foreign policy architecture is deeply flawed, in my view, since it entrusts too much power in one overburdened official (the president, who has both domestic and foreign policy duties). America's foreign policy can only be as good as the president. An incompetent president or one distracted with domestic matters can cause America's foreign policy to be mindless and erratic. My overall conclusion, after reading numerous foreign policy experts, is that America's foreign policy is middling, happenstance, lackluster, average. There's a fairly long list of obvious mistakes such as Vietnam, Iraq (Bevin Alexander's book lists many mistakes) along with successes (containing communism, surviving) -- it's a mixed bag. In the past, America could get away with this mindlessness because of its size and wealth; but in the nuclear age, with the danger of nuclear terrorism, foreign policy can't be an experiment, a happenstance, rather it must be consistently sound and smart. So I propose a structure more like the Roman Senate (during the Republic years). It rarely made mistakes. It avoided unnecessary wars. It consistently rewarded friends and consistently punished enemies. But to fix this structure, it requires another convention. And of course it needs checks and balances. During the Bush years, the republic had EIGHT years of a seriously incompetent commander-in-chief, with widespread agreement about this from partisans on both left and right, and there is the risk that this could again happen. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

Further, the United States lacks an intelligent strategy to prevent terrorism. The Constitution is partly to blame here. It needs to confront the whole issue of anonymous movement in public -- that is, how can we identify movement while preserving privacy? This is the key to preventing terrorism in my view. I think there is no adequate way to prevent serious terrorism without overhauling the Constitution. This, in my view, is a serious question for citizens, but I don't think Americans are really citizens in any serious sense of the word. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

Today's US government is corrupt, with well-documented wastages of money and funds, and further I see as a dangerous shift in power to the presidency and away from the Congress (which should have been the most powerful branch). The executive can essentially legislate by using a vast bureaucracy of agencies that are largely unaccountable to the public and hidden from debate. Presidents have begun issuing [[signing statement]]s -- a fairly recent innovation -- when they describe how they intend to interpret a law made by Congress, which effectively puts an executive twist on a law. The most egregious sign of concentrated executive power is, of course, the power to start wars without Congressional approval (Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Iraq (there was a token vote)). The Constitution explicitly gave the war-making power to Congress. So why does the president have this power? [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

One more huge flaw: [[Citizenship in the United States|citizenship]] isn't defined. I think citizenship should be a contract between individual and state with specific, enumerated responsibilities and privileges, such as paying taxes, serving in the military, police protection, Bill of Rights guarantees, voting, serving on juries, and so forth. I think it should be an active relation which is chosen by a person and declared in a public ceremony. Right now, we become citizens automatically if we're born here and we have the dubious accomplishment of becoming eighteen years old. Americans don't know who their congresspersons are or what they voted for. [[Gerrymandering]] is a huge ongoing flaw since it creates absurd district maps designed to keep elected officials in office. [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

States rights. I see the national government as overwhelming state governments by taking away much of its regulatory authority with creative interpretations of the Commerce Clause which you should be well aware of. The IDEA of federalism is combining the benefits of small-state regulatory smarts under the umbrella of national protection. (according to Tocqueville & others). But unfortunately Washington has trounced state government authority in many issues (eg No Child Left Behind etc etc). [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

Congressperson are in office for life, essentially, since re-election rates hover around 90% for those congresspersons seeking re-election. Once they get in office, they have huge unfair advantages based on (1) campaign funding (6 to 1 advantages according to some sources) (2) franking privileges (3) gerrymandering. Elections should be competitive. They aren't. In my view, this is one more instance in which Americans have stopped paying attention to politics, and I see this as a serious flaw with long term repercussions. I see Congress as out of touch with the people. I have a general problem with the "two-party system" which stifles debate, marginalizes fringe voices, and leads to a staleness of thinking (although there are pluses with the two-party system according to thinkers such as Patrick Allitt -- big benefit -> economic stability, hard to underrate.) [[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:06, 20 December 2010 (UTC)

Basically America has gotten by because of historical advantages in terms of geography and natural resources, but I don't see this framework as being sufficiently competent to take it into the next century. It needs a new structure. It's time for a constitutional convention in my view. And my general overall problem with this article is that it makes people think that all is fine and dandy, but it isn't.

==Criticism of the Constitution: liberal? modern? ==
I think the word "liberal" is loaded and functionally meaningless; it can mean the traditional liberal orientation of the 19th century (ie free markets, individual rights) or it can mean the pro-government left-leaning label (ie the left wing of the US Democratic party). I do not think critics of the Constitution like Sanford Levinson are inherently liberal. I am a critic of the Constitution; I'm non-partisan. Ditto, word "modern" -- what does this mean? Unless there are references showing some kind of identification of criticism of the Constitution with liberal, I think we should leave these terms out.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 00:56, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

== Aren't the amendment facts incorrect? ==
Reading through the article, I noticed it said there are three ways to propose an amendment. It says that the 21st was done through a special convention. This is incorrect to my knowledge. An amendment can be proposed in two, ratified in two. 2/3 Majority in Congress and Convention to propose, and 3/4 State ratify or State conventions happens (this is what happened with the 21st).

Actually, the only way to change and ammendment to the United States Constitution is through the bill process.  The 2/3 vote only counts when congress wants to overide the Presidents Veto.  It takes a 2/3 vote to over ride the President.  The states constitution does not supercede the U. S. Constitution.  Amendments can be added to the constitution it does not take a law suit or a civil rights violation.  Actually all it takes is a proposal to the legislative branch but the ammendment does have to be approved by the Executive which is the President of the United States.--C A Levingston 23:17, 2 February 2010 (UTC)  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Caleving|Caleving]] ([[User talk:Caleving|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caleving|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*Article Five describes three methods of amending the constitution.  The only one that has not been used is the call for a whole new constitutional convention, which is done by a vote of the states.  The other two methods have been used at one time or another: Congress usually approves an amendment and sends it to the states for ratification, but in one case Congress called for a special convention (Amendment 21, repeal prohibition).

If anything, it is a crystal ball issue, but I'm not really sure it poses a problem there. It is currently the case that there is little chance of success.

== Box on right has wrong ratification votes ==

I was going through "Elliots Debates" and per that source (pages 548 and 549) the vote for ratification of the Constitution in Maryland was passed 63 to 11. The box on the side of the article which shows a different number for and nobody against and needs to be updated with the correct vote total.

<blockquote>
The opponents continued to make their objections to the Constitution until Saturday noon. The advocates of the government, although repeatedly called on, and earnestly requested, to answer the objections, if not just, remained inflexibly silent, and called for the question, that "the Convention assent to and ratify the proposed plan of federal government for the United States;" which was carried in the affirmative, '''by sixty-three to eleven.'''

On September 17, 1787, the Continental Congress accepted the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention and agreed to distribute the proposed constitution to the states; each state was then to elect delegates to a state convention to approve or disapprove the new constitution. The Constitution would take effect upon ratification by the conventions of nine of the thirteen states.

== Oldest constitution: US vs San Marino ==

The US constitution is NOT the oldest written constitution in the world. The Statutes of San Marino, enacted in 1600 
(amended since then of course, but this is also the case of the US constitution), are the constitution of the Republic of San Marino (especially the first book, which describes the various councils of San Marino, courts, a number of administrative positions, including the Heads of state, and details the roles and powers assigned to them and how the law is to be passed, promulgated, interpreted and altered), and are still in force today.

The fact that the Statutes are a constitution enforced in 1600 is even acknowledged by the law library of the US congress: {{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/sanmarino.html|accessdate=2008-05-21|title=Guide to Law Online: San Marino|author=Law Library of United States Congress}}. It may not please the Americans that a 23 sq mi country with 30,000 inhabitants has an older constitution than they do, but still it is the case, and it would be good to definitely stop this controversy on the English wikipedia (on the French, German and Italian wikipedia the San Marino constitution is presented as the oldest still in force) and admit the historical truth.

I think you are overgeneralizing about the importance of having "the oldest" constitution.  The fact that the most powerful nation has one of the oldest constitution is what the pride is over.

== Articles of Confederation singular v. plural ==

While the US Constitution is a single document (including all 27 of its amendments) and is thus referred to in the singular, the Articles of Confederation are normally referred to in the plural as the Articles themselves refer to themselves in the plural.  The best example of this is in the closing paragraph after Article XIII:

"...we the undersigned delegates ... do by these presents ... fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and every of the said articles of confederation and perpetual union ..."

Thus, they are ratifying "each and every" article, not a singular document called the "Articles of Confederation."  The title of Article XIII provides further evidence, as it reads: "Articles are Supreme Law..." using "are" and not "is."

The full name of this "first American constitution" is "Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union."  The idea of a singular written constitution was still relatively new to many of these folk, coming as they did from a tradition of unwritten constitutions in Great Britain.  The Articles then, though a written constitution, are approached a little like the British idea of separate acts for each requirement assembling into the whole, with each article treated separately for composition, ratification, and the like.  By the time the catastrophic failure of the Articles had become appearent and the Founders were creating the US Constitution to replace it, the mindset had changed enough to allow the Constitution to be described and dealt with as a singular entity.

Sources for the quoted text of the Articles of Confederation are to be found at  http://www.usconstitution.net/articles.html.  [[User:Professor Storyteller|Professor Storyteller]] ([[User talk:Professor Storyteller|talk]]) 00:15, 7 January 2011 (UTC)

:I see what you're saying.  I am not sure, however, that the mindset of 18th Century men about legal & establishing documents as decided by those particular delegates necessarily still holds true today regarding their use of singular vs. plural - For instance I think it is true that at the time the United States was not thought of as a single unit but as a group of separate entities and a similar sentence would say "The United States were...".  Now we say "The United States is..."  But it seems to me that this discussion should perhaps also be taking place at [[Articles of Confederation]]?  In its first sentence that article states that "The Articles of Confederation was the first constitution of the United States". For purposes of this discussion of this particular sentence and if the sentence were written as it now stands at this moment - there is a subject ("Articles of Confederation") then a plural (intransitive?) tense of 'to be' (were) and then a singular object (constitution).  So if the sentence were reversed we would have "The first constitution of the United States were the articles of confederation" and that doesn't sound quite right either.<br />
:If the consensus is for this sentence to state:
:*The [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] were the first constitution of the United States of America
:instead of 
:*The [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] was the first constitution of the United States of America
:then that is the consensus. [[User:Shearonink|Shearonink]] ([[User talk:Shearonink|talk]]) 02:31, 7 January 2011 (UTC)


:::The change from "United States are" to "United States is" came about as a result of dramatic political changes after the American Civil War.  It was not the result of evolving changes in the use of langauge, but of a nearly revolutionary re-envisioning of the nation by the victorious forces of the North.  Within the disciplines of history, political science, and constitutional law, the Articles are referred to in the plural because they are written as a series of binding articles more than as a singular entity - as with the US Constitution, the intent of the authors is controlling.

:::You can see this in the link I provided - also, a quick survey of hits from Google show a preponderance of plural to singular forms.  Examples:

:::"The Articles of Confederation were, in effect, the first constitution of the United States, created during the Revolutionary War and reflecting the states'..."

:::"...the Articles of Confederation were accompanied by a letter from Congress urging that the document..."

:::Basic rule of thumb here is that the 18th century use is controlling for documents created in the 18th century, and especially so for something like the Articles, where active use began 'and' ended in the 18th century.  Given that they have seen no use or modification since the 1780s, their plural use is most especially correct and controlling, given that the authors intended it to be a plural form and spoke of it as such in the document itself.

::::Yes, I actually knew the change occurred after the Civil War, but my point about the transition from 'United States are' to 'United States is' was to show that the implied singularity or plurality of a collective noun can change, be it a gradual evolution or a revolutionary one.  I really don't care that much one way or the other, whatever the consensus is from interested editors rules the day.

:::::One last professorial clarification - the key difference between the change in usage of "United States" and the Articles is the continued active existence/role of the USA versus the reduction of the Articles to historical artifact centuries ago - this kind of change only occurs over time if the noun in question is still part of the active focus of the sociocultural meme matrices driving the evolution of language.  As to the oddity - that's why most historians phrase the sentence as "The Articles of the Confederation were the first constitution for the United States of America."  Although I should add, a few of my colleagues disagree with that comparison.  Let me know if you need any additional data.

So if the sentence were reversed we would have "The first constitution of the United States were the articles of confederation" and that doesn't sound quite right either.'' - There are several problems in the above. First of all, it is perfectly correct English to have a plural noun followed by a plural verb and a singular noun, for example, "free elections are the cornerstone of democracy". So there is absolutely nothing wrong with "the Articles of Confederation were the first constitution of the United States". Second, there is absolutely no reason why one should not use "was" if one wants to say the contents of that sentence in the opposite order. "The first constitution of the United States was the Articles of Confederation" is perfectly good English, and there is absolutely no reason why one should use the ungrammatical "were" if one wants to say the contents in that order. No native English speaker is normally capable of producing an ungrammatical sentence with an indisputably singular noun followed by a plural verb ("The first constitution of the United States were..."); this can only happen if they've been thinking about this too much while not trusting their ears and/or are confusing English sentences with mathematical equations. --[[User:Espoo|Espoo]] ([[User talk:Espoo|talk]]) 22:44, 8 January 2011 (UTC)

== intro. Constitution was written to solve a problem.  ==

This introduction is taken from modern scholarship of Pauline Maier (2010), "Ratification: the people debate the Constitution, 1787-1788". Without the context, the urgency of the Federalists is incomprehensible. 

All republican theory recommends divided government. The sea change was to reframe the vision of a republic from thirteen-plus-one divided governments to ensure liberty, each of the 14 equal to one another, to one of a republic with a supreme national government, dividing its functions serving the people into legislative, executive and judiciary, delegated by the people for national concerns; and allowing states their own spheres of power delegated by the people for local concerns. 

The unchanging requirement for a soveriegn nation was solvency, and that concern for money was unwaivering, regardless of any amendment or set of amendments which might have to be allowed to secure it. But it must be secured in time to pay ont the principle of debt owed foreign nations. That was not negotiable.

:Very many more of the "people" participated in selecting ratification conventions than participated in electing state legislatures. Existing state constitutions in the main were formulated by legislatures without resort to the sovereign people. So  in a democratic way, the sovereign people, without intermediaries, the people, as a nation, delegated powers to a government in the "Constitution of the United States" for the first time and most directly up until that time among all previous constitutions among the states. The US Constitution was then closer to the people, more immediately derived from them, than the contemporaneous state constitutions, with the benefit of no religious test for office. Of course, that expanded franchise was then subsequently restricted for the state and Congressional elections, and the state legislatures elected US Senators.

Criticisms of the Constitution

"I want young people to understand that ours is a beautiful country, but it has been taken over by men who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties. Our people are basically decent and caring, and our highest ideals are expressed in the Declaration of Independence, which says that all of us have an equal right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The history of our country, I point out in my book, is a striving, against corporate robber barons and war makers, to make those ideals a reality — and all of us, of whatever age, can find immense satisfaction in becoming part of that." <ref name=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States#cite_note-5>{{cite web|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=Making History|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Letters-t-1.html|work=Making History|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=Retrieved 2010-11-14}} </ref>

== First constitution clarification tag ==

Per the clarification tag, I re-read the reference. Maier does not address whether or not an Articles Congressional committee for foreign relations recorded deliberately not choosing to threaten war, tarriff, embargo, joint protest with France, expulsion of the Spanish ambassador from Washington or withdrawal of US ministers from Spain. Nevertheless, the Spanish did not relent in New Orleans at this time, so the phrase, 'to no effect' is an edit to answer the tag as it relates to historical background for adoption of the US Constitution. 

I speculate that another consideration related to US weakness was that it had not enough troops to send anything south. All troops in unit strength were stationed in the Ohio Valley. The Spanish had joined the French against the English during the Revolution, advanced supplies to Americans up the Mississippi, and kept the British from advancing north out of Pensacola by capturing it from the British in 1781. Security from potential threats among non-treaty Amerindians required Spanish de facto cooperation along the Georgia borders. The US could not do anything to Spain in New Orleans.

:Here’s the requested source: [http://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&q=influence#v=snippet&q=influence&f=false “American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776-1989: a global perspective”] NYU press 2009. By George Athan Billias. Law. Winner of the 2010 Book Award from the New England Historical Association. Paraphrases and interjections: Page xi. Some say the influence of the U.S. Constitution is “shallow and unstable”. First, the ideals of a revolutionary (democratic) republican constitutionalism are found in other documents. Billias details six of them from 1776 to 1791. Also, indirect influence on the “concepts of governance” served as catalysts, “motivating foreign constitutionalists to reconsider their options.” (I’d say, See the writings of [[Jose Rizal]], [[Sun Yat Sen]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]].)

:Evidence includes transnational history of ideas, our '''foreign translations''', and exchanges between Americans and their counterparts. (I’d say, See the mutually supportive correspondence between President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and  President [[Benito Juárez]].)  p.xii: Lifting one’s gaze from American exceptionalism, the U.S. is “one of a family of peoples and nations” relative to European civilization. p.xiii: The remarkable similarity is in liberal constitutional democracy, the rule of law, and recognizing individual rights. State constitutions showed written constitutions, constitutional conventions, ratification and amendment. The Articles showed  a constitutional federalism tailored to “diverse regions, populations and cultures”. The Constitution contributed “presidentialism, federalism and judicial review”. ‘’The Federalist’’ sought to reconcile “national power with social diversity and personal liberty”. 

:p.xv. it is also the case that democratizing countries have chosen British or French models, American constitutionalism has waxed and waned in influence, Confucian and Islamic cultures do not readily adopt some of its premises. Nevertheless, “the influence of American constitutionalism abroad was profound in the past and remains a remarkable contribution to humankind’s search for freedom under a system of laws.” p.xiv: Seven peaks:. 1776-1800 northwestern Europe and hinterland. 1811-1848 Latin American, Caribbean, European nationalists. Spanish American War, nationalist movements in Caribbean and Asia. After World War I, anti-colonial movements in Africa Mid-east and Asia.  1945-1974, ex-colonial independence movements. 1974-1989 once nondemocratic regimes, including European ones, transitioning to constitutional democracies.

== Work of the constitution ==

Edits to make parallel constructions. 
# Assume good faith. Both plans sought 'fairness'. The Virginia Plan sought fairness for people in states. The New Jersey Plan sought fairness for state legislatures.  
# Plan weighted large, plan weighted small, is parallel construction using direct language. 
# Once editors agree to call out the election method for President, parallel construction should be given to the elected House and the elected Senate. 
[[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 00:07, 2 June 2011 (UTC)
:First, that's not what parallel construction means. Parallel construction is a grammatical term meaning that different elements of a complex clause or phrase should agree. For instance, ''Michael bought a loaf of bread, pear, and three kiwis'' is not parallel; ''Michael bought a loaf of bread, ''a'' pear, and three kiwis'' is. Second, there is no need to use exactly the same language to introduce two related lists. I'm not sure what you are talking about assuming good faith for, but there is no POV problem with using different neutral phrases to introduce the lists. In fact, the variation is better writing. Your last point doesn't really make sense, but it is also inaccurate. In the early days, legislatures often elected the slate of electors themselves, so specifying something about the people choosing them is just wrong. I think you might be trying to say that if you say who the House represents and who the Senate represents, then you should also say who the president represents, then you have a point, but the better solution is to simply remove the bit about the president. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 05:46, 3 June 2011 (UTC) 

::First, your edit is good. With that concession made, some rumination. There is power and economy in using similar phrasing in presenting two proposals of equal stature, both substantially incorporated in the 'great compromise'. 

::This avoids slanting with 'words to avoid', such as POV 'fairness' attribution for one side and not the other. 'Parallel' contruction applies not only to clauses, but also sentence structure. Generally, most public figures do not lie outright, but tell half-truths. In WP, the reason for using sources rather than original research is that the primary documents do not mean what they say alone, they mean what they say in context, and that is why we must lean on scholars. Editors are not called to adjudge one side as proposing something 'in order to be fair', for instance. 

::The usage of 'geared' may be too colloquial, but I got it okay. On making reference to presidential selection in the compromise paragraph, it was properly enumerated in both proposed plan summaries as salient, so reporting what the compromise did with each item is also worth addressing in the paragraph about the compromise. That being said, I agree with you that my sentence was awkward, it raised more issues than it answered, and it needs a rewrite. Move later.

== Criticism section ==
The following changes need to be made. 

1. Re Sabato's comment re Supreme Court "judges" (they're referred to as "justices," but whatever): in the linked source he is referring to all federal judges, not simply supreme court justices.  this should be clarified to avoid confusion.

2. When Sanford Levinson wonders whether it makes sense to give "Wyoming the same number of votes as California, which has roughly seventy times the population" it needs to be noted that he is talking about only the U.S. Senate, not the U.S. House of Representatives, which has proportional representation; thus, "the same number of votes" quote, as it is presented here, is misleading.

3. Most of the "criticisms" presented here are not actually criticisms of the Constitution itself, but rather criticisms of modern political behavior.  A criticism of the Constitution itself would be, e.g., "it does not define due process" etc.  

I suggest to the powers that be that this section be put to a vote for removal.  it is a very low quality section.

== worldwide influence and translations ==

Reading into Billias as referenced, I was surprised to see the Gordon S. Wood theme of the US separating from Europeans...in the US case most directly, the US constitutions are placed by the people over the government in such a way as they cannot be changed by any sitting legislature. In the British government of the time, the constitution was whatever was passed in good form by Parliament and signed into law by the Crown. Part of the revolution between 1776 and 1783 was the realization that, in Jefferson's view, the people can be ruled by a tyranny of a group of men (a legislature elected by them) just as well as a hereditary king. ... as long as the old parliamentary system is adopted in multicultural nations, it allows a dominant faction (Fed.Paper#10) to oppress the others; no one will lay down arms until their grandchildren will be the English in the national scenario, and not the Irish, nor the Scots ... Did not the English cede an independent Ireland, did not Scotland gain local rule?

:The four 19th Century men pictured are meant only to illustrate near contemporary advocates of constitutional democratic republics around the world, each holding ideas of a just society of individuals based on principles of practice other than race,  religion, color or national origin. I do not pretend that any two of them in the same country would have joined the same political party. I only mean to show that they had a shared belief in nationalism, trust in the people, and appeals to orderly governance under a written constitution which can be read and understood by all, which is to be applied equally to all.

::Then that's original research and can't be on Wikipedia because it violates [[WP:NOR]].  First of all, Lincoln doesn't need to be in that group because he's already an American and the section is about ''worldwide'' (i.e., international) influence.  Second, unless you have a footnote for the three others indicating that their work was primarily influenced by the U.S. Constitution itself (as opposed to America in general), then you're making a first publication of an original synthesis by yourself, which is original research. Plus it looks like you're probably wrong.  (You call yourself a "historian"?)  For example, the Three Principles of the People were inspired generally by Lincoln's writings (such as the Gettysburg Address), not by the U.S. Constitution in particular. --[[User:Coolcaesar|Coolcaesar]] ([[User talk:Coolcaesar|talk]]) 15:21, 6 July 2011 (UTC)

The WP biographies of each of the pictured men are linked to their WP articles. 
 
First, the section about influence of the U.S. Constitution would include the man who preserved it. It was challenged in the mid nineteenth century, as was the Mexican. Lincoln and Juarez were mutually supporting actors. Please see [[Benito Juarez]], scroll down to the external link, * [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtbenitojuarez.html Mexico's Lincoln: The Ecstasy and Agony of Benito Juarez]. Juarez accepted military aid from Lincoln. He jailed the Confederate emissary. Lincoln is included among near-contemporaries to establish a real, documented connection, as opposed to a general speculation about coincidental phraseology. That’s what historians do. You have not cited any serious scholar to say there is no connection between two, or that neither has to do with constitutionalism derived from the U.S. Constitution. 

The pictures lead the reader into the text as found in WP policy. The referenced scholar, [[George Athan Billias]] explains there is direct and indirect influence, and the American governance is not only held in the literal transcription of the Constitution’s text, but in six documents that he spends chapters explicating. I make no original synthesis. The text footnotes are found linked to [[http://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&q=influence#v=snippet&q=influence&f=false “American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776-1989: a global perspective]] NYU press 2009. George Athan Billias. Law. Winner of the 2010 Book Award from the New England Historical Association. Page xi – xv. You have not cited a scholar of repute which denies indirect influence nor one that repudiates Billias’ thesis on the connectedness in intellectual world history. The WP editor must read an entry before attempting a critique. 

It is widely understood that America is based on the Constitution, not race or religion. There is no “America in general” without the Constitution. There is no such scholar “indicating that the entire body of work” among Juarez, Rizal and Sun are “primarily influenced by the U.S. Constitution itself”. Part of the discussion is the influence of these ideas in other cultures. There is to be nothing “primarily” to be found about the Constitution in the entire body of work by the poet novelist and sculptor, for instance. Although, come to think of it, when Rizal left his medical and philosophy study in Spain and took additional reading in Paris, France, and Heidelberg, Germany, the multi-22-linguist was exposed to professors who were “directly” influenced by the U.S. Constitution, so you may be interested in beginning this line of inquiry with his life in Paris. See David McCullough’s new book ‘’The Greater Journey’’ on foreigners learning in Paris. In the 19th Century, university was free, with a command of French, all that was needed was room and board. 

At [[Sun Yat-sen]], the reader sees an education acquired in Honolulu beyond the Gettysburg Address. Years in exile in Europe, America and Japan added to acquaintance beyond Lincoln, although one may speculate before undertaking some research. In the WP article’s external links, see [http://www.sunyatsenhawaii.org Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Foundation of Hawaii] A virtual library on Dr. Sun in Hawaii emphasizing his intellectual roots there, before it was America.

::Now that the Gettysburg Address is recalled in this context, The U.S. gave the world “… a new nation, … dedicated … to the proposition that ‘all men are created equal’. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation so conceived … can long endure … It is for us … to … resolve … that this government … shall not perish from the earth.” Without Lincoln's preserving the nation, its Constitution would have had less influence internationally. None of the three 'foriegn' world-class intellects would have objected to including Abraham Lincoln with them as an examplar of egalitarian, republican, nationalist constitutionalism influenced by the U.S. Constitution. Unlike, say, an image of Jefferson Davis, regardless of similar phrasings found in the Confederate Constitution.

:::That's the problem.  Most of what you just said is wild rambling and sheer speculation.  From having majored in history at the most prestigious public university in the United States, I can tell you if you were to write that in a history class at any top-tier university, you would be lucky to get a C- for poor research and sloppy interpretation of sources.  The Billias book does address the global influence of the U.S. Constitution.  But although it points out that Sun Yat-sen was influenced by the Gettysburg Address, it does ''not'' discuss any direct influence of the U.S. Constitution upon the Three Principles of the People.  Furthermore, the connection between the Gettysburg Address and the Three Principles of the People is already mentioned in those articles (and in the case of the latter article, buttressed by a better source). And the Billias book also doesn't address Rizal or Juarez ''at all''. 
:::Under core content policy [[WP:NOR]], this site ''cannot'' be the first publisher of original research.  The burden is on the editor wishing to ''add'' assertions, especially ones making a first synthesis of disparate concepts (in this case the U.S. Constitution and political leader in ''different'' countries), to get a reliable source in which that assertion was first published.  Is that policy an annoying pain in the neck? Of course.  But that's what keeps Wikipedia reliable.

Click on the Billias link. Search ‘Sun Yat-sen’. See page 309: Sun and his fellow constitutionalists were eclectic … interpreted in the context of Chinese history, customs, and traditions. p. 310: The 1946 Constitution reflected the American influence in other ways. The executive branch … judicial review … the American bill of rights tradition … the writ of habeas corpus …  Look to the footnotes in the Billias text on the pages discussing Sun Yat-sen. We find Lawrence W. Beer.  The link is there for all to read. 

At Lawrence W. Beer, [http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1088&context=mscas&sei-redir=1#search=%22Beer%2C%20influence%20american%20constitutionalism%20asia%22 The influence of American constitutionalism in Asia], two chapters pertain: '''Republic of China''': American influence on the formation of the constitution and constitutional law of the Republic of China: past history and future prospects by Herbert H.P. Ma, and  '''The Philippines''': The American constitutional impact on the Philippine legal system by Enrique M. Fernando. Real historians read footnotes and follow the sources. 

I’ve added links for reader access to Billias, Beer, Farber, Lorey and Lucero, Malcolm, H.H.P. Ma, and Enrique M. Fernando. An expanded section might include J.B. Starr and Christopher J. Lee. It seems to matter very much to Caesar to challenge any assertion that the democratic republican ideal of governance might spread across continents, cultures and races. Fair enough, let us follow truth wherever it may lead us. What scholars are there to deny its influence? If there are not, then not.

::After reading the Ma source and rereading Billias more carefully, I stand by my accurate criticism of your flawed understanding of those sources.  Both Ma and Billias take pains to expressly point out that Sun's Three Principles were influenced ''only'' by the Gettysburg Address, but neither attempts to link the Three Principles directly to the U.S. Constitution, and it is simply wrong on your part to imply that they did that.  Indeed, Billias expressly downplays such a connection at page 309: "Any resemblance to American constitutionalism consisted merely of certain parallels." By way of contrast, although the 1946 ROC Constitution did show clear American influence (while also referring to the Three Principles), that was because of the eclectic legal experience and training of its drafters, not because of Sun himself, who had died in 1925.  Reading anything more into those sources is not only original research that is improper on Wikipedia, it is also [[teleology|teleological]] analysis bordering upon [[Whig history]], which is simply unworthy of Wikipedia.  To paraphrase [[Stanley Mosk]]'s quote about the role of the judge (see the article on him for it), a historian takes the facts as they are and not as he might fervently wish them to be.--[[User:Coolcaesar|Coolcaesar]] ([[User talk:Coolcaesar|talk]]) 06:48, 24 July 2011 (UTC)

First of all, and most importantly, meeting coolCaesar’s recommendation to specifically cite documentation connecting each pictured individual with the U.S. Constitution in their work has improved the article. Thank you for your suggestion. There is no longer an objection to my sourced idea that indios Americans such as Juarez and Asians such as Rizal and Sun were influenced by the ideals of democratic republican constitutionalism. The charge that such an idea was novel to me alone in “wild rambling”, and unsubstantiated “sheer speculation” is withdrawn by his citing Ma in his last.  

He relents in his earlier review of the literature, that nothing but my original research said Juarez, Rizal and Sun had any learning in the U.S. Constitution. He drops the foregone conclusion that no Asians were students of the U.S. Constitution, and that  expression of such “disparate concepts” should be dismissed as “poor research”.  This certitude in intellectual history is redolent of [[Leopold von Ranke]]’s historicism, where the only admissible historical evidence is directly linked to state documents. Wasn't he fired from his state job for being too democratic? My personal antidote in English translation is [[Fernand Braudel]] of the French Annales school to look at a larger social experience and exchanges of ideas in literature. 

Asians have the capacity to read and have read on the subject of self-governance. They are competent to comprehend and have understood a wide literature. They have original thinkers who modified, not only western ideas, but multiple Asian intellectual traditions as well. Initially, the unsourced ad-hominem attack on my contribution seemed a sort of derivative [[Social Darwinism]], which, although once fashionable at our alma mater in the 19th and early 20th Century, is no longer influential among the history faculty there. Thank you for reading into Ma. Please now see Li Quing Yu of Nanjing University, “The fact that Dr. Sun Yat-sen became a great revolutionary and thinker is inseparable from the influence of American democracy, especially the U.S. Constitution, upon him.” as cited in the notes. 

Lincoln, Juarez, Rizal and Sun all sought an equitable rule of law within their own traditions, based on free, widely based national suffrage, and apart from any regional militia coercion, hidalgo encomienda, colonial oppression or feudal warlord. All of them believed in the possibility of “progress” over time, if by degrees, their people could move away from those antecedents of tyranny and oppression of the individual. Surely to describe those who believed there can be progress, the historian must describe the subjects' belief in “progress”. 

There are distinctions among teleological histories of “progress”, Whig, Transcendental, Marxist, and others which in fact do qualify as wikipedia sources. I prefer authors working out 'contingency' to understanding personalities in their historical context. A third framework held by scholars used in wikipedia look to intellectual analysis by deconstruction. Each editor will have their 'druthers'. Historiographic source labeling is not crucial to Wikipedia editing, only good faith. 

An editor need not personally adhere to a subject’s world view, only fairly represent it. The historian must not deny facts just because he fervently wishes they were not. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 05:17, 25 July 2011 (UTC) 

:Relative to the article, it seems that coolCaesar and I have now narrowed our differences to relative emphasis on the origins of the “Three Principles of the People”. I concede that the three categories are derived from Lincoln, though expression of this and in constitutional writings “consisted merely of certain parallels”. 

:At the risk of being accused as 'wild' again due to the author's interest in literature, a source for the intellectual history of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address can be found in [[Gary Wills]]’ book, “Lincoln at Gettysburg: the words that remade America” {{ISBN|0-671-867742}}-3 (PBK). Ideas from Bancroft, the Jacksonian Democrat, included “government by the people, not just for the republic” (Wills, p.46) More directly, the abolitionist transcendentalist, Theodore Parker, advocated “the American idea" of rights and equality, and “The idea demands for its organization, a democracy—a government of all, for all, and by all…” (Wills, p.107).

::Okay, let's discuss it. My starting point is that the paraphrasing found here on "United States Constitution" is a well written resource that makes the U.S. Constituton accessible. It is exemplary. Everything in the article besides the paraphrase ought to drive the internet surfer into the paraphrase-text. A wall of the text alone will not do that.

::One reason for putting any other words or pictures in at all, besides the paraphrase, is to give the general reader a motivation to take in the actual paraphrase-text. To develop an understanding of a document, to give its words meaning, this includes giving a context relative to its adoption, its use and its significance. 

::Another reason for expanding on the paraphrase-text alone, is that an encyclopedia article should be more than a transliteration from 1700s British colonial legalese into 21st Century American. That would be a title in a documents compendium, a different literary enterprise. How am I doing so far? [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 13:34, 1 August 2011 (UTC)
:::"Everything in the article besides the paraphrase ought to drive the internet surfer into the paraphrase-text." Really? I disagree and don't see the logic in that. This is an article about the United States Constitution. It should explain why it was written, what it says, and what place it holds in the world. In an article called "United States Constitution", it is absurd to put the part that explains what the Constitution says at the end. If "one reason for putting any other words or pictures in at all, besides the paraphrase, is to give the general reader a motivation to take in the actual paraphrase-text," the most important reason is to explain what the Constitution says. That should happen before, not after, explaining its use.

:::You have a strange fixation on motivating people to read what you keep calling the "paraphrase". That is irrational. If people come to this article, presumably they either want to know about the Constitution. There is no need to motivate them to do anything. Frankly, if they don't want to read the "paraphrase", they will. If they don't, they'll skip it. Our concern is not whether a la carte readers are motivated to read what you think they should read. Instead, the organization of the article should provide a logical treatment of the topic for the reader who chooses to read the article from beginning to end. A logical treatment is one where article builds on itself as it goes, not one in which the middle "motivates" readers to continue on.

:::Finally, your last paragraph doesn't make much sense. You say that the article should be more than a "transliteration" from the original test to modern English. The article already is, so it is completely unclear what the hell you are trying to say. What's more, the section is more than a "transliteration" or "paraphrase". It is an explanation of what the various parts do, which is essential to the article. If you took that out, people who didn't know anything about what the Constitution says would take nothing from this article. As for "How am I doing so far?", I have no idea what that is supposed to mean, so I reserve comment. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 20:09, 1 August 2011 (UTC)

The article should explain “why the Constitution was written, what it says, and what place it holds in the world. “ You do agree, and you see the logic, and you adopt the same analysis. We are good there.  We agree on the general scope of an encyclopedia article. We agree misspellings are not as important as the Preamble. 

I will substitute “restatement” for [[paraphrase]], as it seems to offend. No need to explain. There are so many backgrounds among Americans, the definition of a gentleman here is “someone who never knowingly gives offense. “  Along that line, I love reasoning, I read some philosophy and logic in college and since. Would you do me a courtesy in this discussion, drop the word “absurd”? Don’t worry about labels, just reason, and trust to the good faith and “natural light of reason” in others. I’ve supported you before, and I will again, regardless of the outcome here.  

Chronological sequence should not prohibit other kinds of article organization. The Constitution as a document has its own integrity which stands apart from the context narrative. The guiding rationale I propose is that article context should appear before the document restatement. 

The logic of chronological events should not trump communication, regardless of audience. For another way of looking at editing, see WP:AUDIENCE. An alternative logic would place the context before the document. The Wikipedia guide is, “Make your article accessible and understandable for as many readers as possible.” We can evaluate the context we have built in an article by asking, “Can people tell what the article is about if the first page is printed out and passed around?” The context should be placed on top. 

Splitting the context above and below the document may be appropriate in a kind of newspaper style. That would place less important items at the bottom. But here the rule is WP:MOS, which is governed by the logic of a more academic audience as found in [[The Chicago Manual of Style]], [[Hart's Rules]] and [[The MLA Style Manual]].

:I concur with Rrius that the current structure is the clearer arrangement---first, here's what fed into the Constitution; second, here's a summary of its key provisions; third, here's the impact of the Constitution.  It's a simple causality structure.   --[[User:Coolcaesar|Coolcaesar]] ([[User talk:Coolcaesar|talk]]) 15:00, 2 August 2011 (UTC)

:You say you agree with me when I say the article should explain "why the Constitution was written, what it says, and what place it holds in the world," but you take that to be simply a list of what should be in the article rather than what the order in which it should be, which is what was clearly intended. The logical order Coolcaesar and I propose does far more for the audience than does yours. You don't like the word "absurd", so instead I'll say that your opinion that it isn't all that important to discuss what the document actually says anywhere near the beginning of the article is astounding. Nothing in MOS says your position is correct, and none of the others is relevant. The structure that I support, the one that has been around for a while now, is repeated throughout Wikipedia. This is not a complex topic. A nice, boring chronological structure is what best communicates this topic to readers. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 16:02, 2 August 2011 (UTC)

[http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_14.html Charters of Freedom] webpage at the National Archives and Records  Administration is precisely coolCaesar’s argument.  “Making of the Charters”, The Charters”, and “Impact of the Charters” is the order of the exhibits as we file by left to right. Without another editor to join me to advocate Context - document organization, he has persuaded me to relent for now. And, the National Archives webpage has given me a couple of ideas to expand our Wikipedia article.  

I think I may see my disconnect with Rrius. I see discussion here as collegial exchange. But in the case of a debate, the affirmative says a) there is a need. b) here is a workable plan. c) good things will follow its adoption. The negative side says a) there is no need. b) the plan cannot work. c) worse things will follow if we try. 

Rrius seems to take a debater’s stance. He can deny my addressing our disagreement only by ignoring my paragraph 3,4,5. Then somehow while we agree on the WP style for an introduction, I am misrepresented as deleting the introduction. I would not, see my earlier article edit.  If I do not make an answer in my allotted rebuttal time, the debate judge will score an unanswered point for Rrius. (Un)fortunately, by the debate analogy, our discussion is a wash, since Rrius did not deny my WP:MOS point that there is an audience. The judges score card will say that for the purposes this debate, editors write for an audience (buzzer, time called). 

Here is the difference. In a discussion, coolCaesar made an argument; he spent not a word denigrating mine. He drove me into research for evidence to support my point of view. I discovered that for now, the example of subject organization I found supports his argument. On the other hand, Rrius seemed to spill a lot of ink to pin my ears back with mischaracterizations and punishing declamation. I don’t get it. But I still maintain that Rrius has made good contributions, and he will again.

== 10 of 13, or is it 11 of 14 -- still the same date. ==

The states had Article V power to alter the Constitution directly, regardless of the action or inaction of Congress, in session or out, an acknowledged weakness under the Articles of Confederation. No President could have the power to stop it. If there are 13 states in the Union, 13 x .75 = 9.75, Virginia’s ratification, making the tenth of them, puts the first ten amendments into effect. 

Vermont entered the Union March 4, 1791, nine months before Virginia’s ratification. When the Union grew from thirteen states to fourteen states, 14 x .75 = 10.5, the ratification hurdle changed from ten to eleven. We can’t say that until we have a reliable resource among a preponderance of scholars to overrule the National Archives source for the “ten” requirement. 

If it is fourteen states, Vermont is in the tenth to ratify as of November 3. It does not matter that [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=003/llac003.db&recNum=2| Washington transmitted the news] to Congress Wednesday Jan 18. Virginia’s ratification on December 15 gave the fourteen-state Union the eleventh state for three-quarters ratification “for all intents and purposes”. So the date remains in a thirteen-state Union or a fourteen-state Union, the first ten amendments are ratified on December 15, 1791.

== San Marino's constitution(s) ==

San Marino is certainly a republic. And attention must be paid to a place that Abraham Lincoln accepted honorary citizenship in 1861. (See the [http://www.consigliograndeegenerale.sm/on-line/Home/Listituzione/PalazzoPubblico/Storia.html  Lincoln bust] in the Great Staircase of the Government Palace in the Public Plaza, San Marino, photogallery, page 5, lower left.) And it has great stamps, the sale of which provide a substantial portion of annual government funding. 

However we may not consider its Constitution older than 1924-26.  And it may not be a self-governing nation-state comparable to the United States. According to the U.S. State Department, [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5387.htm San Marino], by the constitution of 1600, lower court judges were forbidden to be citizens. The reform legislation of 1924 allowed citizens to be judges, but “most lower court judges remained Italian citizens”. 

According to The World Factbook, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sm.html San Marino] has ceded its right to allow broadcasting from its soil, the nation-state of Italy is responsible for its defense, and the “electoral law of 1926 serves some of the functions of a constitution”. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 13:09, 10 August 2011 (UTC)
:Is there an explicit source that calls San Marino's constitution the first in the world? I imagine that such a thing is the sort of trivia generally found near the beginning of many books on the American Constitution.

== Bill of Rights ==

"...the first ten amendments are known as the Bill of Rights."

Is it correct to call the Bill of Rights big ten amendments? I thought they were original parts of the document, and therefore not amendments.

Should they not be called articles? [[User:Modinyr|Modinyr]] ([[User talk:Modinyr|talk]]) 06:26, 12 August 2011 (UTC)

:There was actually discussion in Congress as to whether to re-write the Constitution including the new phrases and re-promulgate it. The vote was for appending each amendment as it was ratified in its order, leaving the original intact. Then, if you had a "true" copy of the Constitution, it is like every other extant. As in so many other things, they fashioned themselves after the ancient Roman Republic, with which virtually every member was familiar. (that last prepositional phrase is English in the Latin grammar, now falling into disuse).

:In this case, the Constitution is akin to the [[Twelve Tables |Roman Twelve Tables]]. "In 449 BC, the second decemvirate completed the last two codes, and after a secessio plebis to force the Senate to consider them, the Law of the Twelve Tables was formally promulgated.[3] The Twelve Tables were drawn up on twelve ivory tablets (Livy says bronze) which were posted in the Roman Forum so all Romans could read and know them." 

:The First Congress of the United States saw themselves in a stream of ongoing history with change made by those living. They would not impose on future generations in Jefferson's phrase, a tyranny of "the dead hand of the past". They anticipated that there would be more changes after them, but each change would be considered without reopening discusssion of each previous article in its entirety. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 11:14, 19 August 2011 (UTC)
::None of which answers the question. The Bill of Rights was not an original part of the Constitution. It became clear during the ratifying conventions that it would be necessary to provide for one, so the 1st Congress sent 12 proposed articles of amendment (as amendments are formally known) to the states. Ten of those were ratified, becoming what we call the Bill of Rights. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 13:15, 19 August 2011 (UTC)

== New power allocations  ==

[[Forrest McDonald]] treats the Constitution's new power allocations in chapter VIII, "Powers, principles and consequences" in his "Novus ordo seclorum: the intellectual origins of the Constitution", 1985. The Wikipedia article reports that "in 1987, the 200th anniversary of the United States Constitution, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) selected McDonald for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities."

== Flag of Second Spanish Republic  ==

Editor Xufanc correctly points out that the [[civil ensign |civil flag]] for the ships at sea merchant marine of the Second Spanish Republic never had a crest. I relied on the flag pictured in the article [[Second Spanish Republic]] for comparison purposes. But on reading the article [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic]] and re-inspection of the one-peseta stamp, it strikes me that the Statue of Liberty blocks the entire view of the Spanish flag, just as it does for the American flag opposite. 

If the Spanish flag extends just beyond the edge of Liberty’s side, it is the “military version of the flag with different, almost square, dimensions.” The military version, like the civil design, had no crest. If the Spanish flag has the same dimensions as that of the United States, it is the banner of earlier republican groups opposing the Bourbon monarchists. Or, it may simply be the variant pictured in the wikipedia flag article, dictated by economy measures in wartime flag production. 

So, relative to information on the actual design and engraving for this stamp to make a definitive statement in our article, I guess we are left with, Where is a [[philatelist]] when you need one?

The source was speaking about the end of the slave trade rather than the end of slavery.  There was a prediction by one delegate that slavery "was fated to die out" under the Constitution, but this does not support the broad claim made in the material I deleted.

:How about we tighten up the edit referring to converting the anti-slavery delegates to supporting the Constitution. 
:The offending passage is " but the Constitution would provide for its regulation and eventual extinction."  The edit intended only that 'abolition of slave trade' means 'regulation' of one aspect of slavery, and for slavery to 'die out', there would be an 'extinction' of the institution under the Constitution. 
:The page 201 citation reads, "As for slavery, he ['Isaac Backus, the Baptist minister'] too hated slavery, but he noted that the Constitution had opened a door for the future abolition of the slave trade that was absent in the Articles of Confederation and affirmed an earlier prediction made by Dawes that slavery itself was fated to die out." We may disagree as to the emphasis or shading of 'affirm' (not I-can-go-with-that0 and 'fate' (not one-day-over-the-rainbow). So here's a re-write, something to the effect:

== ToC and article organization ==

The edit on the table of contents follows WP style and the editor consensus to follow chronology as an organizing principle for the article. 

*Chronology: The major headings are now  (1) History, (2) Original text, (3) Amendments, (4) Judicial review, (5) American “civic religion”, (6) Worldwide influence, (7) Commemoratives, and (8) Criticism. The chronology rule explains moving “judicial review” after “amendments”, “worldwide influence” after “American ‘civic religion’” “criticism” after “commemoratives”. 

*Terminology: “Constitution” is removed from major headings because the reader knows that they are on the “Constitution” Wikipedia page. Likewise, repeated restatements of a heading is removed from its subheadings. Subheadings have been rewritten to reflect others in the article as written, not a list. In the newly named “original text” section, each of the first three articles describe a branch of the national government: composition, selection and powers. “Powers” alone is incomplete. It becomes unnecessary if each branch is named: legislature, executive, judiciary. Similarly throughout. “Calling and convening” was demoted into “Work of the Convention”. 

Categories: 
*The merged category required a split for “Sessions of the House”. In the source documents, the Convention Journal, Madison, et al, the delegates all refer to themselves collectively as the “House” as though sitting in a legislative body, indeed, as their rules implied, Mr. Wilson's protests notwithstanding. 

*Historical influences over the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are nested under “Historical influences” because they are together considered the supreme law of the land. The influences on the Constitution bears expansion, probably from McDonald and Wood. 

*The “Original text” is given new categories to assist international readers. All articles are not created equal. The first three Articles establish a national government. It is composed of three branches, dividing the central power as Montesquieu recommended, by service to the people. All true "republicans" agree, power in the hands of government must be divided to protect the people. This functional division of governmental power is not like others, where the division can be accomplished by society (British Parliament), geography (Articles of Confederation), or family (Venetian Republic). The outline now reflects this important division among the Articles, and uses an internationally understood term, "national" to refer to the national government established in the Constituton.

*The last four Articles define relationships among the “central government” and the “states’ governments”. In the same way that what is known worldwide as the "national central bank” is known by Americans as the “Federal Reserve Bank of the United States”, international readers will find the more internationally understood terminology “Central government” of help in the Table of Contents.

== Op. Cit. ==

To the editors who have been working on this page recently: nice work. Still a lot more to go, but it's definitely looking a lot better than it was earlier. I noticed one thing though. The use of op.cit. has crept into the article quite extensively. The [[WP:Citing sources|guidelines]] don't explicitly prohibit this, but they do recommend against it. It's generally preferred to use something of the style <code>Lastname year, pp. #-#</code> for short references. Would anyone mind if that were changed?

Current reference 49, which I just picked as an example, current looks like this:

{{quote|Bowen, op.cit., p.93. He was the son of a shoemaker, now a farmer and lawyer. Although awkward, vulgar and laughable to more polished colleagues, he was an honest political broker. The most frequent speakers on the Convention floor were Madison, Wilson, G. Morris, all nationalists. Roger Sherman of Connecticut, a small-state ‘federal’ delegate, was fourth. His legislative philosophy was, “When you are a minority, talk. When you are a majority, vote.” Among the small-state advocates, he would make the most speeches throughout the Convention.}}

== San Marino's constitution(s) ==

San Marino is certainly a republic. And attention must be paid to a place that Abraham Lincoln accepted honorary citizenship in 1861. (See the [http://www.consigliograndeegenerale.sm/on-line/Home/Listituzione/PalazzoPubblico/Storia.html  Lincoln bust] in the Great Staircase of the Government Palace in the Public Plaza, San Marino, photogallery, page 5, lower left.) And it has great stamps, the sale of which provide a substantial portion of annual government funding. 

However we may not consider its Constitution older than 1924-26.  And it may not be a self-governing nation-state comparable to the United States. According to the U.S. State Department, [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5387.htm San Marino], by the constitution of 1600, lower court judges were forbidden to be citizens. The reform legislation of 1924 allowed citizens to be judges, but “most lower court judges remained Italian citizens”. 

According to The World Factbook, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sm.html San Marino] has ceded its right to allow broadcasting from its soil, the nation-state of Italy is responsible for its defense, and the “electoral law of 1926 serves some of the functions of a constitution”.

:Is there an explicit source that calls San Marino's constitution the first in the world? I imagine that such a thing is the sort of trivia generally found near the beginning of many books on the American Constitution.

== Op. Cit. ==

To the editors who have been working on this page recently: nice work. Still a lot more to go, but it's definitely looking a lot better than it was earlier. I noticed one thing though. The use of op.cit. has crept into the article quite extensively. The [[WP:Citing sources|guidelines]] don't explicitly prohibit this, but they do recommend against it. It's generally preferred to use something of the style <code>Lastname year, pp. #-#</code> for short references. Would anyone mind if that were changed?

:There are really neat conventions available to Wikipedia editors that save server space in aggregate over thousands of articles or aid in bot scanning and amending. Us newbies do not always have those arrows in our quiver, and some are just plain, old fashioned, back of the garage, elegant coding. Sweet. 
:Along a similar, but low-tech line, I would like to cut down on the numbers of footnotes by consolidating references by paragraph, listing multiple pages from the same source, or multiple sources supporting the same paragraph, perhaps with a phrase to relate a source to the sentence where the attribution is not readily apparent. This convention would follow the practice found in a scholarly book, rather than that of an academic paper. I believe that it would ease the visual flow, and that, at some graphic level, the clutter of blue boxes becomes obstructively pretentious to the general reader. Without objection. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 10:42, 24 October 2011 (UTC)

== Quotes in references ==

Current reference 49, which I just picked as an example, current looks like this:

{{quote|Bowen, op.cit., p.93. He was the son of a shoemaker, now a farmer and lawyer. Although awkward, vulgar and laughable to more polished colleagues, he was an honest political broker. The most frequent speakers on the Convention floor were Madison, Wilson, G. Morris, all nationalists. Roger Sherman of Connecticut, a small-state ‘federal’ delegate, was fourth. His legislative philosophy was, “When you are a minority, talk. When you are a majority, vote.” Among the small-state advocates, he would make the most speeches throughout the Convention.}}

I assume the part after the page number is a quote? '''<font color="navy">[[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]]</font>''' ''(<font color="green">[[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]</font>)'' 18:39, 22 October 2011 (UTC)

:The passage after the page number is an editorial expansion of the narrative which would kill the flow of the main article for the general reader. It is taken from the referenced page, paraphrased. The material in the quotes is a quote from that page. I have also used the convention, "(Jones, page 74)" at the end of a note which is from another referenced source not called out at the beginning of the note, when "Jones" is fully cited elsewhere in the article. Otherwise, I tried to give an external link for reference in the note.  

:In trying to avoid endless listing, enumeration and tables, and to extend explanation of detail which is fascinating to someone like myself who is interested in the mechanics of the convention, but to none others, I have tried to use the Wikipedia footnote link like a scholarly "old school" text, with notes on the bottom of the page throughout, such as Wood's "Creation of the Republic". This once gave the reader immediate access to wonderful details, but at each reader's discretion as time and interest allowed. It has the same advantage for the general reader as the scholarly publishing innovation which puts all notes in an appendix at the text. But here in Wikipedia, an article footnote is accessible at a click. That is much better than turning to the back back of the book to some sort of ad hoc reader-devised system of color-coded paper clips at the top, side and bottom of ending pages. 

:Some of that which is of special interest is lost in Wikipedia when a following editor determines it does not meet his "significance" threshold by the criteria of HIS hobby horse, so he deletes it instead of demoting the judgement of the lesser editor to a referenced footnote (unreferenced passages deserve a different fate). If it is preserved in a footnote, however misguided at the moment, an editor at a yet subsequent reading might take the information driven down into "also-ran" footnote status, and make an new expanded section to the article, or initiate an altogether new article, for the advancement of the encyclopedia.

== Note extensions ==

I have added note extensions of commonplace observation, such as "Jones was a signer of the Declaration of Independence." which may be of help to a new reader or the international community. Background knowledge is essential to understanding, one must "bring knowledge to gain knowledge." So I have included informational lists of big population states then and those south of the Mason-Dixon Line, or relative city sizes then and the source of their commercial prominence. These lists relate to discussions which I believe are absolutely essential for understanding. 

For multiplier effect and reader convenience, notes along with links inform encyclopedia reading in a way that no other media can convey the subject information. They do not impact the readability of the article. Each element of supplemental material noted can be supported by scholarly citation when challenged. I have followed the general WP guideline that the work does not have to be perfect before beginning our collaborative publication. Out of interests of collegiality and collaborative enterprise, a skeptical editor could well serve the project by tagging "citation needed" wherever unsure, or if policy requires, I will happily return to the scene of the crime and exhaustively document.

== Material by Maier restored  ==

per the discussion above, the passage has been rewritten: 

Just as the abolitionist George Mason refused to sign the Constitution, in the ratification conventions of Massachusetts and Virginia, the anti-slavery delegates began as anti-ratification votes. Still, the Constitution "as written" was an improvement over the Articles from an abolitionist point of view. In the Massachusetts Ratification Convention, Federalist anti-slavery delegate Isaac Backus confronted abolitionist Anti-Federalist Thomas Dawes, trying to gain his support for adoption, reasoned that the Constitution provided for abolition of the slave trade but the Articles did not. Sometimes those opposed to slavery were persuaded that the evils of a broken Union would bring worse consequences than allowing the fate of slavery to be determined gradually over time.... 

Good eye. The source material is clearer with a more focused, unambiguous contribution in the narrative. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 12:02, 24 October 2011 (UTC)

== Pics for “subsequent amendments”    ==

Amendments to the Constitution are a decision recommended by two-thirds of Congress, both of ''state'' delegations in the House of Representatives, and two Senators per ''state''. Amendments are enacted by three-fourths of the ''states'' in their legislatures, without any other agency. They do not depend on re-passage by either house of Congress, signature of the President, nor Supreme Court concurrence, all of which were considered during the Constitutional Convention. 

To symbolize states and state legislatures, the pictures of state capitols are chosen to represent the diversity of the state legislatures. Visually, the architecture is intentionally variable. There is at least one state from each of the six major epochs of state admissions. One state for seven of nine major cultural-political regions of North America. 

Of the “[[Nine Nations of North America]]”, the state capitols represent “New England” Massachusetts, “Dixie” Virginia,  “Foundry”  Ohio, “Bread Basket” Iowa, “Ecotopia” Oregon, “Empty Quarter” Colorado, “Mexamerica” New Mexico and “Ecotopia” island, Hawaii. (This omits Quebec and “Islands”-Miami).  [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 20:50, 1 November 2011 (UTC)
== Amendments and original text edits.  ==

In edits this week, I am trying to minimizing lists by categorizing related elements, then writing paragraphed narratives with topic sentences. These are also meant to provide structure for future expansion from scholarly sources. Then editors can more readily elaborate each section with additional historical context and analysis. Thus, grouping voting related items together, or trial procedure items together, as those are categories found in the literature of several disciplines such as history, sociology, political science and law. 

Avoiding characterizing historical development as ‘liberal’ or ‘conservative’.  “Liberals” want state gun control when they have no national majority. When “Conservatives” have no national majority, they want state health insurance. The focus of the article is Constitutional, federal relationships among national and state governments, not fruitless labeling.  

Following modern usage, applying “commerce”, “trade” and “gender” to disambiguate from procreation and copulation implied for the modern reader by the words  “sex” and “intercourse”. 

Removal of time-sensitive narrative relating to political parties and legislative majorities. Removal of links to original text where links in adjacent sentence lead to same information, such as “First Amendment”. Removal of uniform list reference to (date) by an amendment where the date is called out in an adjacent sentence in the narrative; the date is available at the link. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 15:46, 3 November 2011 (UTC)
== Parsing the Preamble ==

The extended quote of the Preamble is broken into phrases to aid the new reader to understand a difficult compound sentence. At its root is the meaning, 'We do ordain and establish'. It remains controversial among grammarians whether, 
:(a) 'In order' is to form a ''union'' and to secure ''blessings'' (derived from liberty), then 'perfect ''union''' is described by justice, tranquility, defense and general welfare, or 
:(b) the 'in order to' ''purpose'' is union, justice, tranquility, defense, general welfare and blessings. 
Editors will note I chose (a), primarily because the Enlightenment cast of mind tended towards balance and symmetry, not laundry lists. If challenged, I propose a footnote explaining the controversy, and leaving it as edited for the reader.

== Recent illustration ==

The rationale for illustrations in sections follows: 
:'''The Great Compromise:''' pic of "The Spirit of '76". The younger nationalists taunted the older as "men of '76", meaning old fashioned. Henry answered, As old as I am, I am still proud to be called a Rebel. (He used the word 'appellation'.) It also establishes context. At the time, no one knew the Constitution would work. There was nothing dishonorable in being true to the principles of the Revolution, Mr. Randolph's little rant about treason notwithstanding. Those opposing did not call themselves, "Anti-Federalists", by the way, so I have tried to minimize the term in these historical sections, but I caved to the overwhelming modern convention later in the article. 
:'''Slavery in debate:''' pic of "Escaped Slaves". Freedom in mankind is a force of nature. The couple are attacked by mastiff hunting dogs, a force of nature. No row of docile field hands hoeing, no picture of  a permanently crippled man or woman maimed on a whipping post by an unhinged overseer who could not find a punishment to fit the crime, no picture of separating babes-in-arms from their mothers. The balance WP strives for related to a theme of interest addressed by the abolitionists both in the Convention and in the States. Abolitionists are represented since C. Pinkney was the only delegate to defend slavery, and he only once during the Convention. Most slave-holding state delegates spoke to getting ratification back home, or for abolition like Dickinson of Delaware and Mason of Virginia.
:'''New power allocations:''' since I got my ears boxed in another article for another editor's hand drawn map, I made a point to find polished maps here. Marvelous pic in winter of a statue on the steps of the modern (1935) Supreme Court Building in the foreground, with the new (1865) Capitol dome in the background to symbolize the two new branches of national, centralizing government which are agreed by the people in the states to check state legislatures under the Constitution. 
:'''Ratification and inauguration:''' pic of "Washington taking the Oath of Office". As for Adams behind the pillar, I think he had it in mind that he might be able to make the Vice-presidency into a sort of coordinate office, like the pairs of dictators chosen in the ancient Roman Republic. Washington gave him no chance, although Adams had his turn at the presidency. Adams was the first to hang his laundry in the White House, among un-plastered rooms of a design that Washington had chosen. 
:'''Republics and fundamental law:''' a pic of "Cromwell dissolving the Long Parliament". Not to put too fine a point on it, Cromwell was a finally victorious general in a civil war, fabulously popular with the people, who ended the rule of a monarch and established a republic. Everyone in the Convention knew the history. Back in Virginia, when Patrick Henry held forth against the dangers of "some future Cromwell", he was talking about his political enemy, George Washington, and everybody there knew it. 
::By the end of Cromwell's Commonwealth, it may be remembered, English in their tyranny executed one another for the crime of dancing. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 18:15, 8 November 2011 (UTC)
:'''Native Americans:''' pic of Pontiac "Giving a talk". Disputation to show culture clash without atrocities of either side. Delegates to the Convention were informed and had an interest in, developments on the frontier, and knowledge of Amerindians. With all the cultural differences, it is of profound interest to me how there remained, among those on both sides of the divide, those who sought to deal with one another in good faith. Neither side could restrain bad actors with the judicial governance each had in place. 
:-- For a European example, see Franklins famous editorial condemning Pennsylvania militia for slaughtering Christianized Amerindian farmers and their families in their fields instead of marching west to battle warriors of independent Amerindian nations at war. For an Amerindian example, see any number of nations where young men had not met the qualification for war chief (plan, prepare and lead three raids with booty returned and no loss of life in the war party). Europeans who could not successfully negotiate with the legitimate councils of the nation would arm the unqualified youths to begin making war on their European enemy. But still, there yet remained among both cultures elders, the impulse to peaceful coexistence. Puzzling. Worth a WP article one day. 
:'''Article One, Two, Three:''' pics of early 19th Century exterior and chambers for House, Senate, President, Supreme Court. Not the twentieth Century illustrations usually given. Revolutionary veteran John Marshall, a member of the Virginia Ratification Convention, was walking these paths of Capitol Hill as Supreme Court Chief Justice on his three-mile walk every day, and on them he saw these structures go up, and at work when he was in town and not out on the federal court riding, he saw the rooms furnished, expanded and relocated.  [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 01:14, 8 November 2011 (UTC) 
::'''Captions:''' Editors will note all members of Convention are tagged with their state, but for two. They are George Washington (American) from Virginia, and Benjamin Franklin (American) from Pennsylvania. These are the only two who are arguably "American" in the modern sense of the word, and recognized as such by their contemporaries in every part of the country.

== judicial review - expansion ==

The scholarly source for expanding 'judicial review' comes from C. Herman Pritchit's "The American Constitution", Chapter 9. "Judicial Review".  He had a 30-year career in the political science department at University of Chicago, then an emeritus career at University of California, Santa Barbara. He authored the landmark publications, "The Roosevelt Court: a study in judicial politics and values, 1937-1947", and "Public law and judicial behavior", 1968. Pritchit was a groundbreaking scholar of enormous influence in studies to better understand how judges actually decide cases, and why. The American Political Science Association's "Law and Courts Section" award's an annual "C. Herman Pritchit Award", named in his honor.

== BOX - "authors" amended ==

The article box had the authors of the Constitution as the "delegates of the Philadelphia Convention". The attribution is amended to "twelve state delegations in Philadelphia Convention". The document is signed, "done in Convention by the Unanimous Consent of the States present". Of course, editors may personally view using a private source as more compelling. Wiley Washington wryly wrote in his diary that night, "signed by eleven states and Mr. Hamilton". But I prefer to use a style describing the authors as they did themselves for the public on the public document in the WP summary article box titled the "United States Constitution" (that document). Mr. Hamilton as an individual delegate might be duly ref-noted if an editor challenges, referencing General Washington's dairy. But I would rather not.

== collapsed tables - members & Marshall ==

To avoid the clutter of tables which can contain interesting and informative detailed information, I have added two more collapsed tables to the previous Ratification by state, one concerning the members of Convention, the other members of the Marshall Court. 

The first is members of the Convention. I have added to the signers table found elsewhere on WP to include those present and refusing (3), and those absent (13). Absentees are not distinguished between great advocates of the Constitution such as Wythe, and great opponents such as Lansing. That is the work of another day to footnote or otherwise tag each absentee, or color-code the font, or perhaps provide a second related table of the reasons of those not signing, and their eventual support in state ratification conventions, and subsequent national and state office. 

The second new collapsed table is the Marshall Court. this is taken from a table of all U.S. Justices which is found elsewhere on WP. It includes the Justices on the bench at Marshall's appointment, two of whom are illustrated in our article, and those appointed throughout Marshall's service, including two illustrated.

== Does Wikipedia have a list of constitutional scholars? ==

Wondering whether anybody knows this or should we have such an article. I'm trying to contact them on a related project [http://knol.google.com/k/thomas-sulcer/the-second-constitution-of-the-united/38jyd65oa42fm/37# here] but I only know of a handful.

== Restore 'First government' pix ==

The “First government” text refers to events during the Articles government. The pictures illustrated paragraphs, per WP policy. Third paragraph described British forts on American soil, illustrated, and Barbary Pirates, illustrated. Fourth paragraph addressed domestic disorder, illustrated. 

Nevertheless, the illustrations were crowding the text. The pix were out of text sequence, which might have lead a reader to miss their relevance. 

The section is reformatted to conform with illustration elsewhere in the article. The two international pix are aligned in a gallery with appropriate captions, aligned with their paragraph. 'Disruption' pic is aligned with its text. Visual impact of the pix is no longer overwhelming. 

An improvement, I think. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 13:21, 15 November 2011 (UTC)

== Note to the reader ==

Note to the reader box is added to invite the first timer to spend ten minutes to see the article through. It seems best for a lengthening article, though still WP "readable". 

Table of contents might show the next level, but that pegs the first section off the top two screens. Can ToC be broken into columns to allow for expansion without visually disrupting the continuity of the article?

Although the U.S. Constitution is regularly mistaken to be "The Supreme Law" of the Untied States, it is in fact not. It is only how the government should be run, and it protects the rights that a U.S. Citizen has.

The constitution is not the laws, it only sets it up so that we can have laws and rights, and a government that functions the way that our founding fathers envisioned it running.

:As to the substance of your comment. The understanding that there can be no "Supreme Law" is a noble philosophical tradition. There are still threads of it throughout American jurisprudence, as when a jury finds a defendant guilty, then awards no penalty for a law it does not believe to bring justice in the case, as a matter of equity. For instance, In Tennessee, Scopes was fined one-dollar for teaching evolution. This was the same rationale used by a judge to declare the Union dissolved before the South Carolina legislature did. (There was no referendum to the people among those persuaded that states are sovereign, not people.)

:Nevertheless, this article's subject is the U.S. Constitution, which allows itself, to be the "Supreme law of the land" prima facie. The phrase is from the days of Magna Carta, and a time of customary law ruling most of English courts. The topic in most libraries, history of the English Constitution, will lead you to fascinating variety. Without a will, Common Law holds 1/3 goes to the widow, 2/3 to the children, however many they may be. In some shires, it was all to the widow, in others, all to the children. 

:The article fails you in not discussing the evolution of "fundamental law" and its adoption by the people in the states of the newly created Union, at a minimum of nine, begun with eleven, then thirteen ...  whatever may have been the England of Edward Coke in 1616. And again, we preserve for ourselves, from the work of Coke and many threads from many sources, the right to silence in a court of law. 

:And again from Coke, his compelling maxim, "A man's home is his castle", with all the rights to privacy only the nobility enjoyed at the time for every man, and now, for us, for every man and woman and child.

::'''Note''': in the literature, "modern English history" means after 1066. Before William the Conqueror, under Anlgo-Saxon customary law was, if one of my kin is killed by one of yours, justice is served if one of my kin kills one of yours. see [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]] for a 20th C. American example. Early in Norman rule, murder became a crime against the Crown, not the deceased family. The accused went before a King's court. The jury was empaneled by twelve peers. Thus if you were an accused baron with ten men-at-arms, the jury had 120 at their command. The king needed no standing army to enforce the jury's decision, the sheriff had immediate resort to an armed posse, and the Normans won the affection of the great mass of the people, who otherwise lived under a feudal order where the lord could literally get away with murder.

== Judicial review: intro pix and new category   ==

A gallery illustration for the ‘Judicial review’ section is added. Chase Court and Taft Court are pictured in the intro section. The titles, ‘Chase Court’ and ‘Taft Court’ are referenced to discussion of the Court significance found in their respective Chief Justice WP biographies.  The ‘interpreted Reconstruction’ and ‘incorporated Amendments’ are referenced to the WP list of court cases in each Court, along with a link to explain ‘incorporation’.  

In the introductory section, a detailed sentence on the Marshall Court is deleted as it was included in the ‘Establishment’ section. 

A balanced way to treat judicial review would be to address accomplishments made by innovative courts as this doctrine was developed. The earlier section ‘civil rights’ is deleted. The new section ‘Subsequent Courts’ follows the ‘Establishment’ section discussing the Marshall Court in judicial review. Other courts to be considered in the context of judicial review are the Chase Court, the Taft Court, the Warren Court and the Rehnquist Court.

== "Re-allocate power" revision ==
Careful readers could not connect the dots in the "Re-allocate power" section as written. Illustrations seemed unconnected to densely written text which too closely tracked a single academic author. I have added two additional sources, reordered some of the sentences, tightened up the narrative, provided transitions, supplied sub-headers, restored two deleted illustrations, added a third, and extended the narrative to better explain the difficulties that the Convention faced in sorting out the new "sovereignty of the people" in new federal allocations of power. I think it is improved. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 16:16, 17 November 2011 (UTC)
== TOC revision, continued  ==

Edit headers throughout to 1-3 words per WP style, simplify and rewrite intro and transitions for “Work of the Convention” into “Sessions” into “Convening”. Under  Convention “sessions” is now clustered ‘convening’, ‘agenda’, and ‘slavery in debate’.  

In ‘original text’, repeating “Article” for seven subsection titles is against WP policy. The enumeration of seven items as a list confers no meaningful information in a list so short. The titles of the articles of the Constitution are named and linked by official titles “Article One”, etc. at each subsection.  A table of contents is not a list of official titles. The same edit  is repeated for the word “amendments” throughout the ‘Amendments’ section for same reason, as was done for “Constitution”  throughout in an earlier edit for the same reason. 

Demote ‘slavery in debate’ into ‘sessions’ because it was not resolved in convention. Demote “time ran out” as one of the ‘abandoned’ amendments clustered with ‘quit by practice’ and ‘quit by policy’. Demote “separation of powers” under “judicial review”, a practice which developed as it became “established”.  

There are now seven major divisions. Each major division has 2-4 sections.  Each section has 0, 1, 2 or 3 sub-sections ... a more conceptually rigorous outline, I think. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 17:19, 18 November 2011 (UTC) 

::Pegging TOC left, floating 2-column galleries, allows for illustrating the Table of Contents with two ,representative pix from each of the first six major divisions, excluding "criticism" only. All INFOBOX text remains unchanged, though earlier parchment dimension is lessened 20px to align spacing. For a browser narrower than outlook, the INFOBOX will narrow the first pair to one illustration, then the sixth division, "worldwide" pops below the TOC holding its gallery=2 without a break in the article continuity. Works for expansion of screen out to MacBook dimensions. Continued header cleanup per WP:STYLE manual.

== New Constitution for United States ==

Many have asked and I shall here confirm that Citizens of These United States are drafting a new Constitution.  The authority for a new Constitution emanates from the Founding Fathers of These United States as expressed in the Declaration of Independence signed on July 4, 1776, in that Great City of Philadelphia.  

To wit:  “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”

We, the People of These United States, call upon The States of the United States, jointly and severally,  to enact Article V of the United States Constitution and to revise, refine, and restore to the People of These United States the penumbral Constitutional “Right of the People and to alter or abolish” the United States government and “institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”

We the Citizens of These United States call upon all Citizens and Residents of These United States to join this petition and declare the United States Congress in Contempt of the People for its Betrayal of Public Will and Conscience.  The United States Congress has become synonymous with Tyranny and Injustice, its members salaciously putting first their selfish fiscal welfare and to the detriment of the Rights of the People.   Throughout These United States and, indeed, the World, the government of the United States of America has become synonymous with Corruption, Illegitimate Secrecy, and Betrayal of Public Confidence.  Against the Will and Interests of the People in Peace, Justice, and Prosperity, the United States government has forsaken its primary duties to Safety and Happiness, usurping the Privilege of Office for personal greed and a standard of living alien to those they have sworn to represent, even divesting themselves of the Responsibility to adhere to the laws they pass.

Therefore, We the People of these United States declare the United States Congress in Contempt of the People and call upon the States of These United States to convene a convention as authorized in Article V of the United States constitution.  We call upon the Leaders of those several movements now known as the Tea Party Movement and the Occupy Wall Street movement, and all People of These United States and, indeed, the World to join this Declaration of Contempt of the United States Congress.  We call for the States of These United States to invoke Article V of the United States constitution to restore to the People of the United States a GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE, representing Justice and Equality for all in a form, “as to them shall seem most likely to effect” the Safety and Happiness of the People of These Fifty United States.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Math5577|Math5577]] ([[User talk:Math5577|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Math5577|contribs]]) 05:27, 22 November 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:As a Manifesto, please note that the Declaration is in the traditional form of an [[Indictment]] which includes a [[Bill of particulars]]. This has none. There is an interesting WP article on calling a new Convention, at [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution |convention to propose amendments]]. All states but Hawaii have called for one, and seriously, 32 of the required 34 were concerted together in the 80s for a balanced budget requirement. The previously enacted law requiring a Balanced Budget co-sponsored by Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin and Sen. Harry F. Byrd, Jr. of Virginia, in the 70s did fail. No Congress can bind a succeeding Congress by law, since the people are sovereign, not the legislature. Hence current interest in an Amendment, that is, a fundamental law directly from the people to bind Members of Congress. 
:This, like the proposal by an editor above to include a thesis in the body of the article that "there is no fundamental law", is properly an aspect of the '''Criticism''' of the Constitution, which if properly researched, would be welcome by WP editors as an expansion of the "Criticism" section. Additionally, I think that there has been a national convention of third-tier parties such as those for Libertarians and Native Americans for self-governance which have more recently met more than one year, and so may meet the encyclopedia "significance" threshold (?) to be included. 
:As the overly long manifesto now reads here, an unkind WP editor may unceremoniously delete it without explanation for being overlong, or worse, [[WP:SOAPBOX]], if it is not to lead to some sort of actual contribution.

== Pirates text = Pirates pix ==

:Broadcast101 has returned to delete the same illustrations as before, and more, as "unrelated" to the text. For instance, the first section speaks of the international situation in the first government including (a) British Forts and (b) Barbary Pirates. Deleted pix include (a) a contemporary British Fort on U.S. soil with descriptive caption, and (b) a contemporary Barbary Pirate attack on a French flagged vessel with descriptive narrative. 
:Caption includes the observation that the French paid the extortion (a word attributed to the pirate activity by source Pauline Maier). The comparison of U.S. and French experience and policy concerning the Barbary Pirates is made by source scholar Pauline Maier, cited in the text with an inline reference.  
* The Articles government had difficulties in their international relations as a sovereign nation, as seen by nationalist contemporaries, and similarly assessed by modern political science scholars of nation-states. They were unsatisfactory in many dimensions. British Forts on U.S. soil trading with Amerindians within the boundaries ceded by Britain was a problem. Barbary Pirates seizing U.S. shipping in international waters, demanding extortion, taking possession of ships, cargoes, and enslaving U.S. citizens was a problem. They should be illustrated with the subject images as significant, of interest and relevant.
* Wikimedia Commons has illustrations immediately available for use in the article. There may be better illustrations extant. Editors are invited to download them following WP policy and substitute the better illustrations. Lacking that, they should be illustrated with the subject images. 
:Is there any sourced discussion as to the inclusion of British Forts and Barbary Pirates in the text? Is there any sourced discussion as to the veracity of the illustrations as characterized in the illustrations as found on Wikimedia Commons? Both referenced text and referenced illustrations concern the same subject matter, at the same place, in the same time. 
:In what way is "Barbary Pirates" text not related to "Barbary Pirates" illustration? [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 12:23, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
== too many little pictures ? ==

:These faces are not vanity cameos. They represent substantially different points of view. Those who suggest that the Constitutional Convention was a conspiracy against the pure revolutionaries of 1776 insist that the secrecy in Convention was covering a monolithic cabal. To picture only one point of view for each topic is to conform to their “hubris”. The nationalist of 1787 were not “borderline sacrosanct” but neither were the “Old Patriots” of ’76, nor the Secessionists of 1860, for that matter. 

:Captions are written to reflect the diversity of positions represented of the text in a clear, graphically related '''four-pane-matrix''', each related to the others. Editors will recognize this systematic approach from philosophy, social science and business school textbooks. In the case of the Great Compromise illustration, there are two examples of unicameral legislature proposals, two examples of bicameral. One state-only apportionment, one people directly only. Two pictured are mixed people and state apportionment: one is apportioned by two ratios of population only, one (adopted) was mixed apportionment with population variations and state equality. Where sources allowed, I chose a diverse regional representation so that all opinions were not pictured as coming from one section, ancestry worship being a problem in history bias as editors and in judicial ruling as interpreters of the Constitution  (a critical scholarly insight reflected in the 'judicial review' section as written.) 

::In an effort to minimize the graphic impact of the illustrations, 2-row galleries are used, trying to maintain the editorial discipline of  limiting each to 1-2-or-3 lines of captions, minimizing the lettering further by using full sized font for the first line title. The result is the WP:style balance of illustrations, spaced through the text. One does not bleed into the adjacent section's text. There is no wall of pictures as in a list or a wikimedia commons feature. the illustrations do not dodge left and right to cram oversized pictures into too-little-text. We can review the illustrations for these kinds of WP guidelines, resizing, deleting or extending text as we discuss the article together. 

:Since inclusion of every illustration is substantiated by scholarship cited in the accompanying text, any deletion as "unrelated" to the cited text needs to be substantiated with a preponderance of scholarship to the contrary, that the illustration is not majority or influencial at the time. The article may be better served by including the adverse point of view in the text which takes exception to the expressed point of view pictured, rather than asserting in hubris that any picture of a point of view disagreed to by a challenging editor needs to be redacted. 
::It may be that an editor does not like direct election of president, so picturing its advocate in Convention, James Wilson, as equal in importance to Madison is objected to. Nevertheless, there were those even in Virginia who were persuaded to the idea, 
::One place where substantial minority views needs attending to as the article is now written, is in the "Judicial review" section, since dissenters in one Court have written so compellingly that there is a later majority holding in a subsequent court ruling that their interpretation applies.  

*Rather than delete illustrations, please tag them with a “needs citation” along with a comment in the discussion about what is found lacking, and a source disputing the subject’s inclusion in the article.

== Pictures, mentoring, article improvement ==

(note: I copied this from my talk page, which had the title ''Mentoring an editor request'', since it relates to this article.)--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:10, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

:I'd appreciate your mentoring me in a situation so that it does not degenerate into an editing war. I've been working on U.S. Constitution for a few months. Trying to build a better encyclopedia article. Most of my edits are correcting and improving my own contributions. My only serious push-back came early on when an editor did not want pictures of Asians or the full-blooded Indio Mexican President Benito Juarez, something about this was an article about America, and these faces were not American. I did the research to source U.S. Constitutional influence on each pictured individuals, in the case of Sun Yat-sen, both a Taiwanese scholar and a mainland Chinese scholar. The editor relented in his criticism of foreign faces as "not relevant.". Virtually every other editorial contribution has improved the article, including the one that blanked my "Note to the Reader" box ...  long story. 
:When I see something sketchy, I try to enlarge on it. So, a while back someone tried to blank out "translations" on the grounds, they said, Everybody knows it got translated drop it, or words to that effect. The original listing of translations seemed to be related to Broadcaster101. It still can be found on his Talk Page. So, anyhow, I did research, opened up the scope, expanded the section with sources, improved the presentation format, and did not change a thing in the original contribution, preserving it, then protecting from future assault by placing it in a larger context of the article structure, which is my favorite thing to do with worthy stubs which are unreasonably attacked with the intent of blanking. I would think that Broadcaster101 would see me as a colleague. 
:Well, a few months have passed and Broadcaster101 has recently deleted pics in the article. I amended formats, enlarged sources, added transitions, tightened up narrative. He has returned to delete the same illustrations and more as "unrelated" to the text. For instance, the first section speaks of the international situation in the first government including (a) British Forts and (b) Barbary Pirates. Newly deleted pix include (a) a contemporary British Fort on U.S. soil with descriptive caption, and (b) a contemporary Barbary Pirate attack on a French flagged vessel with descriptive narrative. It includes the observation that the French paid the extortion (a word attributed to the pirate activity with comparison of U.S. and French experience and policy by source scholar Pauline Maier, cited in the text with an inline reference). 
:If there is a common element among most of the Broadcast101 deleted illustration, it is those with international context! I understand that edit wars hurt an article's status in the eyes of WP senior editors. On the article itself, there is still lots of work still to do, like research and extend the place-holder text in "fundamental law" section, and writing the 'original text' bullets into a narrative, and footnote cleanup, and citing footnote sources in references, etc., etc. But one of the article notices had it that the piece may be under consideration for "featured article" status in the near future. Any suggestions on how to proceed to restore the text illustrations and avoid an edit war?

::''Mentoring an editor request''? ??? Since you're a rather experienced contributor here at Wikipedia, what I'm sensing is that you're wanting me to side with you in a dispute about pictures on the article [[United States Constitution]]. Generally I do not like to get entangled in disputes, but at the same time, skimming the article, and noting that it is a highly read article (8000 readers/day sometimes) then it may be worth it for me working on it in the future.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:10, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

::From my experience here at Wikipedia, one of the most difficult -- but rewarding -- challenges for contributing is to work with other sharp people here, and there are many, including yourself ''and'' Broadcaster101, and learning to respect Broadcaster's judgment about things too. Simply put: we don't know everything. None of us are experts here (even the so-called "experts"). We need to take into account the views of others. They bring a different perspective, sometimes contrary to our own, yet it is important to listen to their suggestions and try to value their views, and work out what is best. Sometimes they're right.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:10, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

::My sense is the article is (Nov 22 2011) nowhere near Featured Article status. My rough sense is there are ''too many'' small pictures -- mugs of players -- and too much focus on the history of the Constitution (there is a separate well-read article on that more specific topic). And the article is not really impartial since it somewhat reflects (in my view) a hubris that the US constitution is borderline sacrosanct. The criticism is buried at the bottom. A big question in contemporary politics today is: is the 1787 Constitution to be interpreted literally, what some scholars call ''original intent'' meaning what the Framers intended back then? Or is it a ''living document'' which morphs based on new developments particularly what Supreme Court justices say it is? (or some kind of balance?) This issue should have more ink, in my view. Further, I would like to see more discussion about the architecture of government -- choices, analysis of how the parts work together, and such. And the way to improve it is for us to ''keep learning'', to study constitutional scholars more seriously who write about the US constitution, and more viewpoints perhaps from college textbooks analyzing the constitution. Finding good secondary resources invariably improves an article.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:10, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

:::See, this is why I like working against you, even though I do not remember your ever agreeing with me. Every exchange we have is like a splash of cold water to wake me up. I was not fishing for support. You have been around the block, and I wondered if you could share a strategy with me that you have used to avoid an editing war, even though you and I do not agree on most things. I take it that the short answer is no, you have no suggestion to avoid an editing war to assist in the U.S. Constitution article. 
:::I am not an experienced editor. I have never been in an edit war, for instance. I do not even know best practices footnote code which the experienced editor brings to the table. I am still stumbling around in op.cit., for instance. One editor here gave me a suggestion, and I intend to systematically go through the notes updating the notation. I may be striving for excellence, but I am neither delusional nor a straw man. 
:::I want to illustrate important points embarrassing to the Articles government which might explain why anyone in their right mind might consider something else in 1787. 1783-1788 was not the golden age of the American republic. There are other sources on the origins and interpretation of the U.S. Constitution besides Jefferson Davis’ “Rise and Fall of the Confederacy”. Considering how much we all have to learn, do I understand from your discussion that until Broadcaster101 shows some sourcing on the subject, his undocumented deletions without discussion should simply be hit with the (undo)? Please read the rationale offered above on Pirates text = Pirates pix. 
:::I was hoping it would not come to that, since I have avoided it in three other disagreements in other articles. Broadcaster101 has not, twice now, shown any judgment that you so glowingly attribute to Wikipedia editor exchanges, only capricious fiat. I thought there might be a technique you use to elicit points of view other than your own. I take it that the short answer is no, you have no reconciling strategy to share with me.

::::I have been trying to look above, into your comments, to search for any hints that perhaps you might be somewhat open-minded about the views of others such as Broadcaster101 or myself. Rather, you seem dismissive (eg "Broadcaster101 has not, twice now, shown any judgment..."). And so if you're asking me for a strategy to avoid an edit war, it's this: please try to become more tolerant, more open-minded; please try to listen to others; Broadcaster101 was trying to tell you something by deleting the pictures.

== it is what it is  ==

:The underlying premise of the article is only that its adherents, the Federal and State officers, elected and appointed, operate on the assumption that it is “supreme law of the land.” Editors may object that there is nothing to swear to, and that there nothing compelling about an oath. Nevertheless, regardless of these interesting and important questions, I humbly suggest that it is enough to examine the nature of the Constitution as fundamental law in a democratic republic used to administer a modern nation-state.
:For the purposes of the article, it is what it is. In several places, at the end of a section, there is a paragraph devoted to critics specifically addressing the topic of the sub-seciton. ‘’’Criticism’’’ of the Constitution as a whole should be expanded at the end of the descriptive narrative. Researched sub-sections should address at least these points, 
:(a) There is no fundamental law, so the Constitution cannot be an example of it. 
:(b) Moves in the past for an Article V petition to initiate a modern Constitutional Convention addressing its widely understood flaws in structure and operation. The last was 1980s that got 32 of the required 34 on the issue of balanced budget amendment (see discussion above). 
:(c) Current moves to build an Article V coalition for calling a convention by state legislatures among disparate third-party movements, from Libertarians to Amerindian self-governance advocates. These address the shortcomings which do not provide for permanent minorities. 
:(d) Non-amendment, state-sponsored, systemic change in selecting the president. Double-digit state legislation has enacted it (2011). When a majority of the popular vote is cast for a candidate, all electoral votes in the endorsing states, are thrown to the majority in the popular vote. This ensures popular vote majority winner apart from state voters or the undemocratic Electoral College. 
:(e) a cluster of academic critiques relative to the operation of the Constitution and its operation for its failure to provide a wider participating democracy, addressing shortcomings in state registration, voting procedures, and counting practice. 
:(f) a cluster of academic critiques relative to the operation of the Constitution and it’s operation for its failure to provide for coherent, authentic political communities of underlying social and economic reality, addressing state Congressional gerrymandering in particular.

== Image guide – add, subtract and substitute   ==

These article guidelines have been taken from WP style sheets, WP:ACCESS and WP essays. They should be followed until a consensus substitutes other WP manual elements. “Generally” denotes my contribution. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 19:19, 23 November 2011 (UTC) 

Add an image
:''Selection.'' Article images (a) relate directly to the text, (b) the text is referenced to a reliable source.

:''Sizing.'' Minimize the graphic impact of the images on text. (a) Do not allow images to interrupt the flow of text. (b) Do not cross the 40% width on an Outlook browser. Generally that translates to a 2-row width gallery. 

:''Image Captions.'' (a) Concisely describe the meaning of the image in a caption. (b) Link the reader to additional WP articles or extended notes in the article for background. (c) Use a full-size title, generally one < small > font reduction for descriptors as space requires. Generally limit captions to 1-2-or-3 lines. (d) Detailed descriptions can be supplied by either (1) the image description, or (2) more generally, a footnote in the article. 

:''Include an alt attribute'' for the image. (a) Even an empty one is a substitute for the image for blind readers, search-spiders, and other non-visual users. (b) If additional [[WP:ALT |alt text]], refer to the caption or adjacent text. 

:''Placement.'' Images are adjacent to text as spacing allows. (a) Images are within the respective sub-section or the section introduction, after the heading and other articles links. (b) They are not in the heading nor at the end of the previous section. (c) Images are spaced evenly in the text of each section, align images right to meet access standards. 

:''Overall view.'' Follow WP:ACCESS. Generally, as an editor begins an edit to a section, the effect of these guidelines should be reviewed and exceptions posted to the Talk page. Adjacent images can be resized or deleted if they have become redundant with the new image, or text can be extended. 

Galleries
:A ''gallery section'' illustrates aspects of a topic that cannot be easily described by text or individual images. (a) Collectively they must have encyclopedic value, adding to topic understanding. (b) The gallery is to be clear, precise and engaging. While [[1750–1795 in fashion]] is the WP example of a “good use of galleries”, the arrangements violate accessibility guidelines. It is disruptive of the text continuity. Generally, there is not enough text to support the numbers of images.

:The ''gallery caption'' connects the image to the text and to the gallery theme. (a) The gallery is titled unless the context is clear from the adjacent text. (b) Generally, if properly done, this can eliminate the clutter of level-5 Table of Contents categories. 

:All ''tables'' are collapsed to give accessibility to the text. (a) Title description enables those unable to see the image to gain some understanding of the concept. ''Charts or diagrams'' have (a) text equivalent, or (b) title description. See WP:ACCESS.

Substitution 
:Generally, editors are encouraged to find better images (a) in Wikimedia commons, or (b) download additional resources into Wikimedia commons and apply them to existing image galleries in the article. 

Removal 
:Since proper inclusion of every image is substantiated by scholarship cited in the accompanying text, any deletion needs to be substantiated with a preponderance of scholarship to justify its omission. The sources must demonstrate that the subject is not either (a) a substantial element of the topic at the time or (b) it never becomes influential in the future. 
:Editors who object to the inclusion of an image as being incomplete or partial can better serve the article by including the adverse point of view in the text, and either (a) provide a footnote in the caption with extended remarks with an WP article or external link, or (b) as space allows, directly add an exception in the caption with a link to another WP article. 
Collegiality
:When an image issue is raised, (a) Tag an image at issue with a “needs citation”. (b) Add a comment in the Talk section about what is found lacking, along with at least one source disputing the subject’s prominence or influence. (c) If possible, contact the editor who uploaded the image, telling them of your concerns. You may be able to resolve the issue at this point. (d) If a copyright violation is found, use WP guidelines for contact, notice and tag.

== maps restored ==

:Nation-states have territory. The map shows the extent of U.S. territory governed, and the land west to the Mississippi. The caption describes the expansion. There is a link to an article on the Treaty with supplementary maps. The westerners were difficult to govern by the state governments shown in pink. See text. The westerners stopped paying taxes to the original states, held constitutional conventions, voted four separatist governments, established courts, taxed themselves, raised militias, declared themselves independent states and treated with Spanish, English and Amerindian nations. See text. The map locates where this was happening as described in the text. 
:Without an illustration of the territorial extent :of the United States, the reader is in danger of “present-ism” that is, assuming the extent of the United States today was the extent in 1787. The map illustrating the extent of settlement relates where the existing sovereign state governments as then confederated held sway. They did not occupy the territory ceded in the Treaty of Paris 1783. That is illustrated in the picture of the British Fort related to the text in the “first government” section, which Broadcast101 also deleted without discussion and without sources denying the existence of the British forts on U.S. territory as described in the text. 
:The second map illustrates both territory and surrounding empires of British to the north and Spanish to the South. Links in the caption show supplemental maps for British, Spanish, Creek and Iroquois. No source is provided to deny the presence of “foreign gold” or that its source came from the mapped territory as labeled and described and referenced in the text. 

*The illustrations directly relate to the text, captions link the reader to additional linked WP articles for background, illustrations are evenly spaced in the text, do not zigzag across the page, do not bleed into the section below.  

*Most new illustrations have a rationale described above in the talk session, “recent illustration” of 8 November. That should be the start of a discussion to delete them, along with citations to references contradicting the text.

== Criticism ==

:Tomwsulcer would elevate the ‘Criticism’ section from its location at “See also”. “Criticism” is written into the article according to WP style. There are criticism paragraphs at the end of several sections. Editors add sourced critiques throughout the article at the end of any section. Can this fail the WP impartiality test on account of no criticism? 

:A quick survey of political science articles show some interesting returns. There is no criticism section of political science project articles [[Petition of Right]], and [[Magna Carta]], Good Article (GA) articles. Articles on sovereign state legislatures have no criticism, such as [[Parliament of the United Kingdom |British Parliament]] and [[Parliament of Canada]] both former Featured Articles. 
:[[Fascism]] has no “criticism” section. Its introduction refers to “organic entity”, “suprapersonal connections”, and “century of authority”. Its critique on Talk speaks to particulars. What would be the particulars, if any, indicating disqualifying bias in this article? 

:Some political science project members do have criticism sections, all at the end of the article, just above “See also”. They include [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |the treaty to report discrimination against women]] and [[New Jersey State Constitution]], both GA articles. This article is not disqualified from GA status for placing “Criticism” in the body just above “See also” according to WP style.

:The '''severest criticism''' of the U.S. Constitution as written is the ratified Amendments themselves. Each amendment section should LEAD with the criticism of how the Constitution was proven inadequate to sustaining a more perfect union of national community. The original text was so destructive of the common good in how it actually lived out among the people, that their sustained, widespread denunciation of it brought about a super-majority 2/3 of the House (people) and 2/3 of the Senate (states) to repudiate a provision. Then a super-super majority of 3/4 of the people as states agreed to abolish the inadequate portion of the old, and establish new fundamental law to better secure their safety and happiness. No "tempest in a teapot", that. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 21:13, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
== Gallery links ==

There are links to gallery pictures throughout the history section/s ([[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], et cetera), but not in the intro paragraphs ([[James Madison]], [[James Wilson]], [[José Rizal]], etc.). I propose this to be changed. Thoughts, comments, suggestions? [[User:Bullmoosebell|Bullmoosebell]] ([[User talk:Bullmoosebell|talk]]) 23:44, 5 December 2011 (UTC)

== Lead guide ==

Write the lead as a stand-alone overview, concise and uncluttered, limited to four paragraphs. Establish the notability of the topic along with its context and a mention of major controversies. Significant information should not appear, specialized terminology avoided. Writing concerns include adequate summarization, length, and accessibility.

== Lead rewrite ==

:Bullmoosebell suggestion to mention major figures featured in the article seemed to me to establish summarization, notability, context and accessibility in a way that was lacking. Following the article guide, I rewrote the fourth paragraph to be summary, footnoted parliamentary tradition for international accessibility, deleted specific information treated in appropriate article sections, and added mention of controversies. The general discussion of its adoption now precedes the significance of specific included articles. 

:Although reference to common law tradition is outside the scope of this article and therefore not appropriate for the introduction, two are footnoted. England because it is a contributor to the U.S. tradition, San Marino as an example of Continental mixed government emerging during feudal Europe. 
:The Founders took into consideration models of philosophy and history, “republics ancient and modern.” Though it must be said, open minded as the Founders most assuredly were, American judges were going to be American citizens, San Marino’s example, choosing foreigners for their jurists, notwithstanding. 

:The reference to the scribe who penned the Archives manuscript is detail found in the article. Other elements of the last paragraph and their links are carried forward in the edit. Linking every name clutters, it violates WP:STYLE. They are linked in the body of the article.

== Screenpage and TOC gallery guide  ==

The model for the U.S. Constitution article is the Feature Article, [[Gettysburg Address]]. It surrounds the Table of Contents (TOC) with a cloud of captioned illustrations to fill the opening screen, avoiding the large white void which still recurs in WP List articles. 

Concern over the opening, first page composition with large white voids at the TOC is a standing issue at WP. Here, to meet an article with a longer TOC, the illustrations follow standard conventions and WP:STYLE. 

The illustrations are directly related to the TOC text. The TOC is anchored left. The advantage here is that the two-row gallery illustrations wrap on small-view browsers without creating voids. This achieves WP composition standards, (a) not floating TOC, (b) images do not impinge on the text of the section below, and (c) the solution works on all browsers, consistent with WP:ACCESS.

== Article scope and infoboxes  ==

This article treats topics related to the U.S. Constitution. While there may be kindred paragraph topics here or there, such as the observation that the Convention took place in Philadelphia, it does not replicate, substitute, or replace any existing WP article on the Constitution, the Convention, and so forth. 

Main articles on topics are linked throughout. For instance, while there is an article on the history of the Constitutional Convention in chronological order which is far more comprehensive than can be treated here, the topic "Great Compromise" is summarily treated in this article, narrowly looking at Roger Sherman's role, with a link to the more comprehensive WP article. That article encompasses all of Sherman's major contributions throughout the Convention, not this narrow snapshot of general interest. The links to more comprehensive articles appear not only within sections, but also within applicable subsections throughout. Wikipedia is meant to be a collaborative enterprise looking at many aspects of complex subjects. This article presents a broad-brush, topical treatment meant to lead the casual reader into more developed articles elsewhere. Please help by adding additional links as appropriate.
 
The wide-ranging nature of this comprehensive survey makes it of interest to many WP Projects. Project infoboxes in the past have been located adjacent to the text in the article which most directly related to the interest of each project. Likewise, original text is featured with an infobox connecting readers to Wikisource. Aligning the infoboxes for all interested projects along the right hand side of the screen would be disruptive of the article and accompanying illustrations directly related  to the adjacent text. That would, in itself, be a violation of WP:STYLE.

No effort is made to feature or exalt one project over the other at the opening screen or at the lead article infobox. The focus of the article format should be the subject matter of the article as it is encountered by a reader. It should not be given over to specialty infoboxes outlining the scope of various WP Projects as featured by interested and related groups of WP editors.

== tag questioning "federal government" removed  ==

The editor, tagging the assertion that the Constitution establishes a federal government as unverified, seems to propose that the Commerce Clause has dis-established the states in all their forms and operations. This is not an accepted point of view held by the preponderance of scholarship in the subject area. Even if one were to be persuaded to that point of view by the roadside billboards, "Impeach Earl Warren", which still can be found along America's byways, that point of view cannot govern Wikipedia as an encyclopedia that holds itself out to be balanced. 

The editor's assessment of changing federal relationships apart and away from the original document is a useful insight for understanding current political practice in the U.S. It is accounted for under article sections "Amendments" and "Judicial review". Regardless of one's assessment surrounding recent American jurisprudence, it should not alter the characterization of the Constitution as a primary document establishing a "federal government" in the article introduction. The tag is removed. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 11:57, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
:Woah woah woah, my point was merely that citing the words of the [[Tenth Amendment]] (as opposed to other passages) as the nexus for the federal system of government seems questionable given that the amendment has been said to have "added nothing to the [Constitution] as originally ratified.", by no less than the Supreme Court, and also "The Supreme Court rarely declares laws unconstitutional for violating the Tenth Amendment". --[[User:Cybercobra|<b><font color="3773A5">Cyber</font></b><font color="FFB521">cobra</font>]] [[User talk:Cybercobra|(talk)]] 17:34, 7 December 2011 (UTC)

== TOC gallery restored  ==

:Cybercobra blanks the Table of Contents (TOC) illustrations. The rationale without citation is that it is “non-standard” and may be “unprecedented ?”. The contribution does no harm, in the sense that it imposes a look like Featured Articles [[Meningitis]], [[Oxidative phosphorylation]], and [[Shoe polish]]. But illustrating the TOC is not unprecedented. 

:The “TOC gallery” is not standard for an article. None is, which is why the blanking edit has no source reference for authority. Attempts at a solution are not unprecedented at WP. Here are five solutions readily found looking through current Featured Articles at Wikipidia.com. 

:(1) TOC illustrated with subject matter adjacent to the TOC . See Featured Article adopted as a model for this page [[Gettysburg Address]].  

:(2) Project infobox. The right side of the page is filled with a wide, brightly colored photograph or graphic, supplemented with colorful charts, tables, maps and oversized legends to fill the void to match TOC length. See Featured Articles [[William Henry Harrison]] and [[Variegated Fairywren]]. 

:(3) Stack full color photos of the topic in combination with infoboxes or for graphic balance, whether or not applicable to the TOC and article text. See Featured Articles [[Free will]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Greek mythology]].  

:(4) Blow up the infobox five times the size of the TOC. See Featured Article [[Hoysala Empire]]. 

:(5) Omit an infobox, limiting the TOC under ten lines, and feature a colorful action photo.  See Featured Article [[Montreal Screwjob]]. 

:I prefer the U.S. Constitution TOC illustration consistent with the policy adopted on the article discussion page, and in a fashion that is related to another important primary document of United States history. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 13:40, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
::(Re: 1) Those images are more of a collage and do not correlate with specific TOC sections, so the situation is different from here (Re: 2 & 4) None of those examples appear to make the infobox/image extra-long for the express purpose of filling the TOC gap; their infoboxes just-so-happen to be that long, or at least this is done '''much''' more subtly than was done on this article. (Re: 5) Is there evidence that the article was structured specifically to avoid a lengthy TOC, as opposed to just happening to have a simple structure with few subsections? (Re: 3) [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] doesn't seem to be an overt example of this (Re: Generally) What's wrong with white/voidspace alongside the TOC? I agree it's not perfect, but crowbaring in images just to fill the space seems worse than the disease. I don't favor [[Gettysburg Address]] as a model to follow; the images jumble up the text alignment and crowd the lede up, IMO. And none of these examples correlates images with TOC sections; in this respect, your approach seems (to my knowledge) unprecedented. --[[User:Cybercobra|<b><font color="3773A5">Cyber</font></b><font color="FFB521">cobra</font>]] [[User talk:Cybercobra|(talk)]] 17:19, 7 December 2011 (UTC) 

:::Thanks again for your detailed work on the article, and here for a reasonable reply. 
:::* All of your objections to the Feature Article [[Gettysburg Address]] are met by the TOC galleries. (1) there is no jumble up in text alignment. The two-row galleries are not 'crowbarred' into the lede, crowding the void in the same way as the Featured Article 'Gettysburg Address'. We are agreed 'Gettysburg' is too tight. My point is that even the composition that you and I agree is too crowded is allowable, and does not compromise the article's eligibility for Featured Article status. It is precedented, but improved upon with a TOC gallery, as the gallery is structured, uniform and accessible. Conceptually, an image is an image, the distinction between a single image coded [[file: with caption, and a gallery image coded <gallery-pipe-file with caption, is a distinction without a difference. 

:::* I yield on the crowbarring comment. Consider TOC gallery, alternate #2. You may be right with the two-row option. On second thought, I would prefer a one-row-one-image gallery and increase the article infobox image up to the allowable 300pix. How about using one-row galleries and narrowing the titles? I have not published it because the spacing is thrown off with the addition of the Constitution project infobox. "Gettysburg" is a model in my view only as a demonstration that the TOC in an article with narrative does not necessarily require the void of WP List articles. The TOC can be illustrated and attain a Featured Article status.  

:::* The void is a problem because it is unsatisfactory as a front-page composition when the reader opens up the browser screen to an article. While we have been discussing the issue, the infoboxes are returned for (1) Constitution document and (2) American politics. Other editors have chosen a stacked infobox solution which is fine for the folks promoting their favorites. Again there is no discussion relative to removing the infoboxes alongside applicable text as required by WP:STYLE. You see how neatly on an Outlook browser the two stacked under the article intobox just meets the bottom of the TOC. In the abstract  a solution in composition, but they do nothing to draw the reader into the text, only to lead one out of the article immediately on entering, off to the editor's favorite project apart from the subject context found in related text found in the body of the article. But the favoritism omits other WP projects: (3) philosophy, (4) U.S History, (5) Conservatism, (6) Liberalism, and (7)National Archives. 

:::* To include all seven infoboxes above the first section would crowd the lede with crowbarred illustration, and interfere with the text in many browsers, especially those for the legally blind, see WP:ACCESS. The second info box now impinges on the first section text with a large screen browser, such as the MacBook Pro. You and I agree this is not the optimal solution in the case of the 'Gettysburg Address'. Is it not also an unsatisfactory composition in the case of two, never mind seven, Project infoboxes? WP does not allow for any article to become captive of only one Project; none can exclude others. Perhaps all seven project infoboxes need to be in a gallery in the 'See also' section for a pleasing graphic array, or each collapsed into a single line there as is the convention for five or more on a Talk page.

:I really like the discussion about voting rights for DC residents. Great minds ... The template for remanding most of DC residential neighborhoods is found in the example of Arlington, Virginia. A casual inspection of a county map will show it was part of the original "ten miles square" boundaries surveyed by [[Benjamin Banneker]]. The people there now vote for their own U.S. Representative and U.S. Senators. 

:Basically, the federal district needs only be the Mall encompassing Capitol Hill to the White House. Security concerns for embassies might add a strip up Massachusetts Avenue ... But reality hits. In the 1960s and 1970s, the proposal in Congress faced a House sub-committee with majorities from Maryland. Adding DC residents would make Maryland politics resemble Missouri, split between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. No way Baltimore politicians, Republican or Democratic, were ever going to cede preponderate, permanent power in the state to some sort of shared democratic free-for-all. Districts would be redrawn, the Rand McNally Commercial Atlas says that the center of regional banking has already shifted from Baltimore to DC. Way to messy for professional politicians, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, you see. The proposal never made it out of committee.

== TOC and references ==

VirginiaH asked me to come to give my thoughts as i've also been editing the article. quite a lot to follow on the talkpage and therefore difficult to follow. Regarding the TOC, this shouldn't be a bid deal, personally i try to minimise having a large white space but it is acceptable for this to happen. personally i don't like the gettsyburg style, i very much prefer TOC to go straight down left-hand side, not with images on left as makes TOC harder to read. the big problem with the article it seems to me is that it is '''too long''' about 20 000 words if i recall (on IE today so prose size tool doesn't work). i think you'd have some problems getting it approved as featured with this length, as it suggests it's not in summary style. VirgH, you asked whether it was ok to '"gang" pages from the same reference in the same paragraph'. i think it's okay, ideally you would break-up to match each page reference to each sentence in the article that it's supporting, but if that's not possible, i.e. because it's a mix and they don't match like that, then it's okay.

:Your entire understanding of the Constitution is critically flawed from both a historical and legal perspective, starting with your statement above that the article should be in philosophy style.  You have turned what was a mostly coherent, compact analysis of the Constitution into an rambling, over-illustrated chaotic mess.  The result looks like a mini-textbook on the Constitution for fifth graders with ADHD.  You also need to take a remedial English composition course at a community college and get up-to-date on current citation formats---op. cit. was abolished decades ago by most citation guides.  Unfortunately, I am too busy defending paying clients to drag you through Wikipedia's enormously time-consuming dispute resolution process.

The article as I found it was a collage of interesting bits and pieces made up of unconnected and unorganized editor contributions. It was not coherent, the style sheet has helped and others see the improvement as such. I was most appreciative of the one-paragraph paraphrases found in the original text section. These are preserved throughout subsequent edits.  

Compactness had been achieved with bulleted lists, mirroring another article. WP would have articles written in an encyclopedic style and policy forbids population of multiple articles with the same text. This article now makes a distinctive contribution to the encyclopedia by using a topical treatment not found in articles of greater detail. The more complete treatments are link referenced in each section. More to do. 

“U.S. Constitution” is part of seven WP projects. Philosophy is one of them. The article now conforms to an established WP style sheet. What is your preference? If you find the Philosophy style sheet chaotic, you owe the Wikipedia Foundation the benefit of your insight to straighten out those folks over there. All those referenced professional journals should have helped, but who is to say. Thank you for caring and sharing. 

The illustrations in this article meet WP standards for spacing through the article, sizing, and encyclopedic standards for galleries as discussed. You are the fifth editor to note that some historical detail doesn't fit an encyclopedic style. Got it, on it. You are the second editor to dismiss my work by association with community college. Virginia's seem to be other than some. That will be addressed in another section.  

“op. cit.” is now practically eliminated in this article by collaboration. See [[Peter Drucker]] on the corporation. The great operational virtue of this business entity as societal organization is that to the outside, it seems as though it has no weakness. Any individual's shortcomings are irrelevant. Attacking “op. cits.” here, is, by the term-of-art used among published historians and legal scholars everywhere, “flogging a dead horse”. Watchful editors may more severely interpret the exercise as disruptive.  [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 14:38, 11 December 2011 (UTC) 

* My graduate level courses on the Constitution were given credit for both History PhDs and Doctorates of Laws. The reason for joint Law School-History Department sponsorship was because they were not very popular among law students. Lawyers want to prepare themselves to make money. Most adversarial jurisprudence is based on case law. As a practical matter, a constitutional defense is the last resort for a client without case law to justify their action. In a way, if it not the last resort, it's like admitting you are no good as an attorney because you have not done your homeowork.
:It is very, very iffy. Promising a prospective client years of ground-breaking constitutional appeals is not the best way to garner large continuing retainers for you or the firm. Most law school curricula have a ConLaw course or two for background and something about torts, then on to the real meat of the business at hand: two years of case law courses applicable in a chosen specialty. The general elements of introductory ConLaw courses found in a three-year law school are the basis for topical treatment of the original text in this article.

== "Introduction" style edit  ==

The rationale for editing the introduction style follows. 
:Paragraph sequence for the Introduction:
: First element. paragraph 1) Definition. paragraph 2) Description. 
:Second element. paragraph 3) History. paragraph (4) Notability, acceptance, usage, criticism. 
* paragraph ONE. The national government has a relationship primarily with (1) its citizens, then (2) states and other incorporated legal fictions, then (3) those within its borders like tourist people and resident aliens.
*  paragraph TWO (old three). “evolving historical constitutions” to give accessibility for international readers. The order in the branches of government follows the hierarchy of the Constitution from closest to furthest from the people. 
:The earlier sentence, ‘They also specify the powers and duties of each branch.’ is embraced in the phrase, “All powers not enumerated”.  
:Federal relationships among national and state governments are manifestly “for the people” as seen in the incorporation of Amendments governing state constitutional law. 
* paragraph THREE (old two). Capitalizing T and P and placing “the people” in quotes is sarcastic usage banned in articles by WP:STYLE. It may just be errata. 
:Phrasing sequence reflects chronology: ratification, ten amendments, then those to total 27. 
:Once the “first three” articles are addressed in the description, the “last four” are.
:Bill of Rights is linked to US BoR in a lead paragraph for US. Constitution. To assume readers will confound English BoR, etc. with the U.S. BoR here is over done. The linked article handles any disambiguation that might be required for the general reader.
* paragraph FOUR. WP:LEAD requires significant criticism to be included in each article introduction. One is provided for those of liberal persuasion, another for those of a conservative bent. --- Note: If a balanced Federal budget were easy, the Byrd (VA) - Proxmire (WI) 1972 “Debt Limit Bill” would have done it.  
:“International figures” replaces a more arcane political science expression for easier understanding by the general reader. Standard American usage requires capital “Federal budget”.

:All right; a quick skim makes me think the biggest problem is the biggest section, History.  About 90% ought to go. To start, any material that appears here and not in the history article should be moved. That makes the majority of it. If that doesn't also get rid of all that back-and-forth about "A" said the party hats should be red and "B" said white so after discussing pink everyone agreed with "C" for candy stripse, then those too should go. With the blow-by-blow accounts go the portraits, or most of them, hence moving the double-column question to the other article for eventual solution. I don't expect all this to happen overnight though I would be pleased if the paragraphs that keep repeating the word "surprise" would vanish. These simplifications pave the way for trimming the article-by-article sections by moving prose to the various article-by-article, umm articles. Does anybody think these ideas point in a hopeful direction but need some clarification and adjustment, or a load of hogwash?

::Good going. Oh, and it seems to me the intro shouldn't mention names. Or anyway not the names of foreigners, but even the names of principal authors of a very much collective work  should perhaps be deferred to the body of the article.

::After sleeping on the more weighty matter of the oversized "History" section, I hit on a simpler idea. Since [[History of the United States Constitution]] has a small section about the 1787 convention, and the present article has the large one, a few hours ago I put a proposal into the other article's talk page, to swap them. This is obviously a big change to both articles, which is why I ask again for opinions on the method rather than just go ahead on the basis that nobody has yet objected to the goal. If nobody points out why this is a silly idea or thinks it a stroke of genius and beats me to it, I expect to do it tomorrow. Several items must be cleaned up afterward, including adjusting subsection depths and perhaps repairing broken citations. Still later, we can think about where the material transferred here should be trimmed. Further trimming of history will shift the focus of this article to [[exegesis]], which I think is the proper one. The present article's discussions of Annapolis, etc are more modest and the question of trimming them can be put off to after we settle the Philadelphia matter.

::::As text is assigned elsewhere, if that article length can support additional images, I would nominate those cut here for there.

== “Introduction” errata edit  ==

By (1) history of convention and ratification, (2) constitutional law as held in the nation and in the states, and (3) national political practice over three centuries, the introduction as previously written was rife with confusion leading to errata. 

* Paragraph ONE. 
:1.	Confounding the national government’s primary relationship with the citizen-sovereigns of "We the People" and the secondary, derivative relationship it has with states which the people also erected for their purposes, is errata. 
:2.	Co-mingling citizens as equivalent to tourists using “people” to describe those with visas but not for citizens establishing the Constitution, is errata. 
:3.	The descriptive adjective to modify the U.S. Constitution’s government as established is “national”. Confounding the descriptive “federal government” with the modern convention “Federal Government” is errata. 

* Paragraph TWO.  (old three)
:1.	The Tenth Amendment is not in original text. Confounding original text and amendments is errata. 
:2.	The Tenth Amendment refers to the people apart from the states. Confounding the nation’s people and the people in a state, is errata. 
:3.	The Constitution establishes a national government with federal characteristics. Confounding that with an Articles of Confederation “federal system”, is errata. 

* Paragraph THREE.  (old two) 
:1. Eleven states ratified to establish the Constitution in 1789. The people of Rhode Island and North Carolina did not, but Congress honored them for their earlier “perpetual Union” with the first ratifying eleven. Subsequent states were admitted by Congress: no to Frankland, yes to Vermont. Later, Congress admitted states formed from states for the people of Maine, Kentucky, and Tennessee. 
:A regular territory-to-statehood process evolved for places without royal charters from England or Spain, founded on the people living there. Congress admitted Ohio, and Texas, but not Kansas on the first petition due to undemocratic procedure. Confounding ratifying states with admitted states is errata. 
:2. In the Constitution the phrase “the People” only has people capitalized. Capitalizing T in the Constitutional phrase is errata. 
:3. Earlier assertion concerning the historical constitutions of San Marino were properly dated. But they were not older than the historical constitutions of England and others. Regardless, confounding historical constitutions of common law with prescriptive constitutions of establishment, is errata.

==Article length==
It's now about 166K. Should it be trimmed further? Perhaps getting it down to 125K would be make it more manageable? What do people think? I spun off two subarticles -- [[United States Constitution and worldwide influence]] and [[United States Constitution as a civic religion]]. --[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 02:40, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
: "US Constitution as a civic religion". Does this name comply with [[WP:UCN]] guidance? I've never heard of the concept. It seems contrived. --[[User:Srich32977|S. Rich]] ([[User talk:Srich32977|talk]]) 03:35, 22 December 2011 (UTC)03:38, 22 December 2011 (UTC) 
::- WP style renders it "civil religion". A search redirects to "civil religion". So, it is found at [[Civil religion]] and [[American civil religion]]. 
::- The concept is that there can be group identity and several levels of social cohesion and concerted action in a large aggregate of population where there is a common ethos. Of course, all sense of human connectedness and commonality is "contrived" in the meaning developed by Sartre and the existentialists. On the other hand, it seems that nation-states may be with us for now, and the U.S. is among them. If people act like a "nation", there is such a thing as a "nation" and they are one. A rose by any other name, etc., etc. "Civic religion", likewise. 
::- "'''Civic religion'''" is from the ancient Roman republic and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, [[Social Contract]]. See the general concepts of tolerance, republicanism, civic virtue, democracy and equality. Additional writers include Erasmus, Locke, Montesquieu, Kant., in Sociology see Bellah and Herberg. The concept is broadly understood and widely used in philosophy, history, political science, sociology and religion. 
:* Now elevated to an article title, the WP style should be used. It should read, "US Constitution as a '''civil''' religion". Should it additionally be merged with [[American civil religion]] ?
::[[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 07:41, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
:::What? This line above confuses me -- ''The concept is that there can be group identity and several levels of social cohesion and concerted action in a large aggregate of population where there is a common ethos.'' What does this mean? I'm having trouble grasping at what is meant. I do think that in America there is a kind of "Constitution worship" going on, in that people almost revere the document as sacrosanct, perfect, above being challenged; is that what is meant? The term ''Civic religion'' -- well I have not come across it that much in stuff I've read. Ditto ''civil religion''. It may have been used by some writers but I do not think the term was that widely used, or have I just not read enough?--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 13:16, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
::- Previously, an editor found my 5th grade prose objectionable. I over-reacted. My bad. The concept is, People see themselves connected and act together in large numbers when they believe the same thing. To say that concept is "contrived" is to say that no one believes anything together because some unnamed authority has "never heard of the concept". Well, I named [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], but I thought I took care of him relative to an encyclopedia using the construct of "nation". Read him. Enough of the "Honest Abe" on my part providing case sources for another side. The concept of "civil religion" has been academically critiqued as a descriptive analytical concept of American 20th-century society in sociological literature. Cite your own sources. If, on reading them, you find them applicable, they can be included. I did not, so did not include them in my edit. Collaborate with me. 
:::There have been many occasions, while contributing here at Wikipedia, that I run into people who are much more knowledgeable than me about a particular subject, and much smarter too, and in this instance, my hunch is that you, VirginiaHistorian, are one of these people. So thank you for explaining the concept of [[civil religion]] and I will try to learn more about it.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 14:10, 23 December 2011 (UTC) 
:::About the writing level. I agree fifth grade is too amateurish. But we should probably strive for ninth grade level perhaps. Writing at the college or graduate school levels risks alienating readers. So I try to avoid words like "aggregate", terms like "concerted action", "common ethos" and make it as simple as possible when I write here. If there is no way to avoid a difficult concept, I work into it slowly, by beginning with the familiar and tiptoeing into the new. One of my concerns with the current ''United States Constitution'' article is that it is written somewhat over the heads of most users, and that simplifying and clarifying the text without losing accuracy or quality would make it more helpful.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 14:10, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

::- The Constitution has been amended 27 times. Who proposes to make it "above being challenged"? They are not referenced in the piece under discussion. In view of U.S. history accepted by the preponderance of scholars in the field, they may not make the "significance" cut at WP. What reliable source do you read to find of this "going on"? If there is none, reference to such is a "[[straw man]]", and not useful in good-faith discussion. Cite your sources, and they can be included. 
:::What I had meant by saying that the current Constitution was "above being challenged" is not to deny that individual amendments can be added, or parts tweaked, but challenging the Constitution as a whole is unthinkable. I know. I challenged the original Constitution with my rewritten one [http://knol.google.com/k/thomas-sulcer/the-second-constitution-of-the-united/38jyd65oa42fm/37# here]. My version gets practically no attention and it probably never will. I am thoroughly cynical about politics but still enjoy learning new stuff.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 14:10, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

::- The "worship" aspect of the Constitution is deprecated in the [[Gordon Wood]] citation, promoted by Washington, dismissed by Jefferson, and they are also, in turn, properly referenced. The context is provided by a Constitutional scholar who generally agrees with your skepticism, [[Sanford Levinson]], in an article published in the William and Mary Law Review. The balance achieved is generally conservative Gordon Wood v. generally liberal Levinson; generally conservative Washington v. generally liberal Jefferson. What reliable sources do you read to dismiss Wood, Levinson, Washington and Jefferson? If there are only fuzzy attacks without supportive alternative references, it is "[[ad hominem]]" and not helpful in collegial discussion. Cite your sources, and their weight can contribute to missing balance.  

::- Background reading might include [[The Social Contract]], although it is not fashionable to have a "[[Western canon]]" of great books. It was influential in the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution and Gandhi's non-violent revolution in India. Also, the French generally use deductive reasoning, which is instructive for those educated in English, a language which tends to use educational resources emphasizing inductive reasoning. An interest in the U.S. Constitution may lead to reading references found in the WP article [[Civil religion]]. Wikipedia is the place to start.  What are you reading now?

:::What am I reading? I have read Sartre, Levinson, Rousseau, but haven't yet come across Gordon Wood and others. I am open to suggestions. I have never quite finished Montesquieu. Have read Federalist Papers. And lots of other stuff from many disciplines, particularly history, philosophy, economics. My problem as I get older is trying to remember stuff I've read earlier. The good thing is that the big picture usually sticks in my mind, so I can see the overall problems; the details are harder to keep in mind, but with the Internet and Google, finding facts is much more do-able than it would have been fifteen years ago.--[[User:Tomwsulcer|Tomwsulcer]] ([[User talk:Tomwsulcer|talk]]) 14:10, 23 December 2011 (UTC) 

:Goodness, are we to discuss the substance of state theory in the discussion page? My two bits worth are that all government is based on faith, which is sometimes treated the same as "religion" and the US Constitution is part of that. 
:Moving on to the topic of spinoff, we've done three so far. Mine, rather a swap with the history article than a new article, was the first and most ambitious and not entirely successful yet. Both of the moved parts need further integration into their new home and the part that arrived here needs more trimming. More urgent, the swap's success is marred by broken refs persisting rather than being repaired by a bot. Either it isn't running or it's busy or the repairs were too complext. I also split off a little bit to [[Connecticut Compromise]], making that article's structure ungainly but we'll eventually get to that. 
:Tom created two articles; the religious one I figure should be merged to an existing similar article, which is perhaps slightly more urgent. When I saw the worldwide impact article it made me ask why I didn't think of it myself, though the name gives me a vaguely uneasy feeling. We'll either find a better name or learn to like it. Umm, but now I've got a vaguely uneasy feeling that I ought to be proposing something. Can't think of it, except "carry on".

== Criticism of the Constitution  ==

Criticism of the Constitution in the [[History_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Criticism_of_the_Constitution|History of the U.S. Constitution]] has a new sub-section describing the "States Rights" critique in the context of the history of the U.S. Constitution, illustrated with images of John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis. This will give proper balance to the encyclopedia over-all when the too-detailed items explaining "states rights" are removed in the U.S. Constitution article as now written. The U.S. Constitution article can then more pointedly be given over to the explication that consensus on this Talk page has proposed.

[[States rights]] is that smaller pie, and of somewhat poorer quality as well, so that's the main place for such material.

== Biased Text ==

In the intro it states

"The Constitution is an object of veneration, but those living under it also lawfully overthrow it by Amendment. "

This is very biased.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/99.150.204.182|99.150.204.182]] ([[User talk:99.150.204.182|talk]]) 17:46, 11 December 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:I'm removing the last two sentences:
:''"The Constitution is an object of veneration, but those living under it also lawfully overthrow it by Amendment. Recent impulses for reform have centered on concerns for extending [[democracy]] and [[Taxing and Spending Clause#Restrictions on spending |power of the purse]]."''

:Neither are cited. The first sentence reads quite strangely; I don't think "venerated" is quite appropriate and I think very few would describe amending the document as "overthrowing" it.

:On the second sentence, there are some amendments that people are discussing (balanced budget amendment, a federal marriage amendment) but I don't think these warrant inclusion in the introduction, and I have no idea what is in mind for "extending democracy". [[User:Equilibrium007|Equilibrium007]] ([[User talk:Equilibrium007|talk]]) 01:38, 12 December 2011 (UTC) 

(1) Thank you for a specific itemization of your objections at the time of your edit. I wish more WP editors were as considerate as you have shown yourself to be. It means we can collaborate.
(2) [[WP:LEAD]] requires the introduction to mention controversies. Please cite a WP policy to support your thinking before altering a section well documented on this discussion page. 
(3) The two sentences still may be improved. Do you have alternative wording? Summary items in an introduction need not be footnoted as they are treated in the body of the article.  

(4) "Overthrow" means "invalidate", which a constitutional amendment most certainly does to some part of the Constitution. Lawful invalidation is not forceable overthrow. To your point, it may be that the common linkage of "forceable" and "overthrow" comes automatically to the American ear, as in the residency/citizenship question from the [[Smith Act]], "forceable overthrow of the United States Government". The sentence should probably be rephrased. WP does not advocate the forceable overthrow of government in its U.S. Constitution article, that is not the intended "take away" for the reader. There should be no misunderstanding on this point. Thank you. 
(5) "Veneration" is backed up by citation. In the criticism section, Robert Dahl is cited in his "How democratic is the American Constitution?" as referring to the "worship" Americans bestow on the Constitution. The section on "Civil religion" cites Gordon Wood. "Veneration" is precisely an equivalent expression of "worship", although more secular in connotation. Please cite a source which backs your English usage of the terms proposing that "worship" as used in Dahl is not equivalent to "veneration" as used in the article summary.   

(6) The summary criticism, example (a), the "conservative" one, was the balanced budget amendment. It got 32 states (64%), two short of calling a convention. The federal marriage amendment is not the same. Editors may unbiasedly distinguish between the balanced budget effort and a 2011 bill for "marriage amendment" with 66 sponsors ( 15% ) in the 435 member House. Nineteen state constitutions ( 38% ) restrict marriage and civil unions together. To assert 32 > 19 and 64% > 38% is not biased. No other "conservative" criticism comes close, so it balanced budget is chosen for the summary. It is mentioned in the "Amendments" section as unratified among the people rather than in the Criticism section with the academics. 
(7) The summary criticism, example (b), the "liberal" one, relates to "extending democracy". The four scholars cited in the article's "Criticism" section all relate to this topic. "Extending democracy" means literally "expanding majority rule". That is the concern of four academics who are cited in the article "Criticism" section. This includes Dahl in "How democratic is the American Constitution?". The direct popular election movement to bypass the Electoral College is mentioned in these Talk sections as a future extension of the Criticism section. It will align with the summary reference to the criticial  concern for "expanding democracy" in the Constitution. 

(8) Again, thank you for giving concrete explanations of where you found the article to be in need of improvement. You have a good ear for the connotations of idiomatic expressions for the American reader, as in your catching the "overthrow" phrasing. Please critically read through the article looking for additional points to improve the article. Thanks.

:I think the current text is better, but I'm still not clear on the "extending democracy" point. There may be some academics offering ideas about this but they don't as far as I see have much political traction and in my mind that ought to be the standard for inclusion. The only one I can think of with political traction is the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] but that isn't a constitutional amendment. The marriage amendment is at least pretty high profile in the political discourse. [[User:Equilibrium007|Equilibrium007]] ([[User talk:Equilibrium007|talk]]) 08:40, 22 December 2011 (UTC)

I feel like the entire "Potential military coercion" section under Amendments (written about the Second Amendment) is written with a biased tone. I'm not sure that I'm up for the rewriting (as, honestly, I'd probably be a bit biased in the other direction) but wording and fact choice could use a bit of work.

== “Introduction” rationale for edit  ==

Readers of the article introduction should not be misled into interpretations of the Constitution which are reasonable, historically interesting, and, properly cited, to be included in this article’s Criticism section. But these are best addressed elsewhere than the introduction. The Constitution was a document written in 1787, incorporating twenty years’ experience in national and state self-governance. Yet a number of interpretations are current which have been derived from the Whig philosophy of 1760. 

“State sovereignty” is accounted for in the article by describing the conscientious old men including most of the signers of the Declaration of Independence attending the Convention, the “men of original principles”. The philosophy is a powerful touchstone among Americans, for when applied to U.S. political culture one hundred years after establishing the Constitution, these same principles resulted in consequences unintended by any party, including immense loss and long term suffering among all parties. The differing points of view were adhered to sincerely, passionately, but there was no Golden Age imagined in some retrospectives. 

Americans sustained violent conflict among themselves for over ten years of Civil War and Reconstruction, a time unimaginably costly in blood and treasure and terror for all concerned. The passage was tragically and fatally flawed for the entire mid-nineteenth century American experience. In an empathetic, romantic way, I’ve seen it in my mind's eye, walking the very lands of my home, “where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground” (Whitman). 

The revisions made to the introduction are meant to make it conform to (1) the history of convention and ratification, (2) the constitutional law as now held in the nation and in the states, and (3) the national political practice. This is meant to be a long, broad view, (a) not just in the twenty years before ratification, (b) not just over the twenty-year mid-19th Century tragedy, but (c) for that which is predominant for two-and-a-half centuries.

In the criticism section:

because the Electoral College allows the possibility of electing presidents who do not win the majority of votes.[218] Three times in American history, presidents have been elected by the Electoral College despite failing to win the popular vote: 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison) and 2000 (George W. Bush).[

It makes it seem as if all other presidents who won an election won a majority when in fact many of them won a plurality of the vote, not an absolute majority.  I think we should change it to:

::Well, yes, but the vote apart from the Electoral College, the national “popular vote”, the “popular majority”, these terms are used by advocates for reform, best discussed in any detail in an article which the “Criticism” section links to. So far, I think the article is okay on this point. Still, consider:

::Historical studies of elections in the United States show that every state varied, and every election in each state has been variable. There have been differences in (1) who legally qualified, registered and voted, (2) variable levels and changing targets of violence by local and other police, hired and vigilante perpetrators, (3) which votes were counted, how they were reported, when challenges issued and who won on appeal. This is “little-d” democracy, sort of. It oughta-be that everyone equally everywhere registers, votes and gets counted in every election. 

::But all votes have not been equal, and any reasonable assertion of comparison among them among different states would require a stratified statistical analysis we have not seen in proposed sources. No scholar of the Constitution currently attributes any lasting impact on American political life from the effects of a national “popular vote” for President. WP articles related to the Constitution should focus on the Constitution’s Electoral College count. Discussion of state and national reforms related to it such as the state district plan and direct popular election of the president should be referenced by See also, Further reading and Main article, mostly.

No less than [[Hubert Humphrey|Hubert Horatio Humphrey]] (D-MN), HHH, one of my favorite U.S. Senators ever, said that the national government had a federal relationship with the states. He walked the walk and talked the talk of federalism, personally supporting the Minnesota ban on serving margarine alone in restaurants the during his lifetime, for instance. Virginia does not have the same interest in the dairy industry, so margarine can be served here, unencumbered with the added cost of equivalent butter each serving. According to the [http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/09/19/wisconsin-ban-on-margarine-targeted-for-repeal/| CBS/AP story], with only 11 of the 132 Minnesota state legislators sponsoring it as of September 19, 2011 the bill to abolish the law did not stand a good chance. No WP editor on this page proposes an act of Congress to allow restaurants to serve cheaper margarine alone in Minnesota. Could it be '''"federalism"''' at work? On the merits, of course, I prefer Minnesota butter over margarine made with Virginia corn, regardless of the cost, POV. . . . on further prompting, I would now list the 10th and the 14th for abbreviated introductory purposes, were '''Jeisenberg''' to collegially agree to collaborate in that way. 

Does anyone here remember the annual cheese and apple reception thrown by Capitol Hill staffs of Senator Proxmire (D-WI) and Senator Byrd (I-VA)? Not only did Minneapolis steal my childhood Senators baseball team, Wisconsin staffers used to win in the softball game every year. But all is forgiven for giving women the right to vote sooner than Virginia. Win or lose, we could all drink to that. or we used to. But I digress.

The number of representatives from each state is based on, "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. [http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/freedom/constitution/text.html]"  This section of the Constitution also happens to be one of the most misunderstood.  Many people believe because the Constitution only counts slaves as three-fifths of a person that it is a racist document.  However, it is the South (slave states) that wanted slaves counted as whole people.  It was the North (anti-slave) that want slaves not counted towards representation.  The North argued that only free men could be counted towards representation.  Slaves would not want to be counted so the South gained more representatives in order to gain more votes to keep slavery legal. Without counting slaves as people counted for representation the South knew that the North would out vote them and end slavery once the Constitution passed.  The compromise was for slaves to be counted as three-fifths of a person. [http://www.nhccs.org/Mnotes.html Madison's Notes From the Constitutional Convention]  The South could go home saying they got the better part of the deal (3/5's is better than half) and the North still had the majority of votes.  However, as history showed the North did not have the resolve to call the South's bluff and end slavery.

::Right, that's kind of the point.  In the original Bill of Rights as passed by the first House of Reps, there were 12 Amendments.  Each had to be individually ratified by the states.

Which means that each amendment had to be ratified individually, going into effect once sufficient states had ratified it.  The Constitution was "amended" once the last necessary vote ratified the proposed amendment.  So the 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992, which was when the Constitution was amended(not in 18th century).  The first Amendment was ratified on Dec 15th at a certain time which amended the Constitution, then the 2nd Amendment was ratified which amended the Constitution (etc).

:- Unlike San Marino, the '''United States''' has a charter constitution. It is older than Switzerland's because Switzerland summarily re-chartered their republic in the same way France has done, rather than altering the original document by amendment and allowing inconsistencies to be interpreted in the Courts over time. 
:- The European summary manner was considered by Madison as floor leader in the First Congress for the first twelve amendments, but the first round of state ratifications was such a near run thing that it did not make any political sense to chance a failure to get the Bill of Rights through. And even then, only ten of the twelve made it through, but Anti-federalists still gave the new U.S. government a chance.  
:- There was no need to seek a European-style lock-step in the U.S. The states physically adjacent with like legal traditions would have separate decisions in each of three appellate districts. Further appeal to the Supreme Court was limited. So there was diversity in state federalism AND regional federalism concurrently. 
:- The '''Virginia and Plymouth''' corporate charters are not properly considered state constitutions. The British colonies of 1776 all had western boundaries along the Appalachian Mountain chain according to the Proclamation of 1763. The United States established boundaries west to the Mississippi River, successfully negotiated competing colonial claims to establish a Northwest Territory without slavery and a Southwest Territory with slavery, and all state constitutions were subsequently written anew. I believe all states have changed their Constitutions in a summary manner at least three times in American history, during the span of the Early Republic, Jacksonian Democracy and Progressive Eras. Rhode Island in the Early Republic Era may be the only exception I know of, and that led to the [[Dorr War]].

::::The [[Constitution of Massachusetts]] is not a charter of "supreme law" because the US Constitution (as well as federal law when applicable) has supremacy over it.  While it is the oldest continuous charter Constitution and is historically very important due to its influence on the US Constitution (and other constitutions), it clearly can't be considered a charter of "supreme law"  [[User:PantsB|PantsB]] ([[User talk:PantsB|talk]]) 03:25, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::The US Constitution only has supremacy over state constitutions in areas of exclusively federal or shared jurisdiction. Each state is a separate sovereign, so within its exclusive sphere, each state's constitution is the supreme law of the land. By contrast, city charters and the like are wholly dependent for their existence on the state, so a city charter (or town by-law or the like) cannot be the supreme law of anything. Scholarly breeze is right: the word national is necessary, so I've added it while also restoring the more natural and meaningful "written constitution". -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 09:20, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
::::::  This is not true.  see: the [[Supremacy Clause]], Article VI, Clause 2. "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the '''supreme law of the land'''; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding."  The states are also not [[sovereign state]]s as it is generally understood in large part because of this clause.  [[User:PantsB|PantsB]] ([[User talk:PantsB|talk]]) 19:16, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
:::::::The fact that you would say any of that shows you have no idea what you are talking about. The federal Constitution is one of enumerated, and therefore necessarily limited powers. Where the US Constitution does not extend, a state constitution is supreme. Acts of Congress, etc. can't trump a state statute or constitution in an area where the federal government doesn't have explicit power to act under the Constitution. If you don't understand that, you clearly don't understand the American federal system. If you don't believe me, go read some court decisions about federalism. It is that simple. As for states not being sovereigns, I'm sure the thousands of judges who have stated the contrary would be very surprised. Even the article [[Laws of the United States]] mentions it. It's right there in the lead. It's right in the first sentence of [[U.S. state]]. Even if they are not sovereign states in the sense you meant (foreign relations?), they certainly are in the sense that I intended and that is relevant when talking about constitutional law.
:::::::: I don't know why you are getting worked up.  You are also incorrect.  [[Supreme law]] is just that - supreme.  If a law can be overturned by a higher power it is not supreme.  That's just the basic definition.  A state is not sovereign just because it retains some powers under the '''federal''' constitution.  A federal law can never be nullified by a state law or Constitution, it can only be restrained by limits placed on federal power by the Constitution, because the US Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.  When the powers of the Constitution have been made more broad - such as when the 14th Amendment extended the Bill of Rights to restrict the power of the states- it overrules state law or state Constitutions.  States are not [[sovereign states]], they are the textbook example of [[federated states]] in large part because they've ceded this authority.  [[User:PantsB|PantsB]] ([[User talk:PantsB|talk]]) 21:45, 6 August 2012 (UTC) 

:::::::::- Ancient feudal prerogatives of the dead do not rule the living in a democracy, and the 600,000 bloodshed of the slaver-led rebellion 1861-1865 was not for free. The "sovereign state" issue ends when the '''Fourteenth Amendment''' says all protections of the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, shall be extended to citizens of every state under every state constitution. Then, the '''Fifteenth Amendment''' says that everyone who has rights in the U.S. has the same rights in every state. 
:::::::::- So, 13th = we are all free, 14th = we are all citizens, 15th = we all have rights (men vote). Thousands of judges have held since 1868 that the 14th amendment applies to the STATES, and precedents constraining the federal government do now ALL constrain the state governments, and they are just as limited relative to the sovereign PEOPLE as the national government has been in all its branches. 
:::::::::- And, for the '''Seventeenth Amendment''', when the states in their legislatures abused their trust granted from the people long enough, the sovereign PEOPLE  by 2/3 of the people in the House, and 2/3 of the people in the states in the Senate, and 3/4 of the people in the states in their state legislatures, WITHDREW the privilege of voting for U.S. Senators on loan to the STATES in their legislatures during good behavior, and gave it to the PEOPLE in their states. The sovereign people of the nation removed the state privilege not only from the states which voted for it, but from all the legal fictions we call states, which are all subservient to the sovereign people in theory and in practice. 
:::::::::- Article VI is very precise, clear and short. The Constitution, U.S. laws, and U.S. treaties are the '''supreme law of the land''', "the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of '''any state to the contrary notwithstanding'''. Members of state legislatures, their judges and their governors "shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution." There are no "sovereign states" in ANY sense of the term. Their Constitutions are NOT supreme relative to the Bill of Rights or any other provision of the U.S. Constitution as constitutionally enacted by the people of the United States, including selecting U.S. Senators or any other thing.

:::::::::::- Thereafter each state admitted into the U.S. was made up of people acting in their sovereign political character petitioning the U.S. Congress to be admitted into that perpetual union on the very same footing as equals, perpetually unalterable in any way in law or in fact -- but by free discussion and deliberative action made through the people's representatives in the several states according to the uniform process of Constitutional amendment conducted under the auspices of -- either (a) two-thirds of the U.S. Congress, ratified by a three-quarters concurrent majority of the people in the states, -- or (b) in a Constitutional Convention called by a majority vote of the U.S. Congress, of all the states, by a simple majority vote among the state delegations, freely elected by their people for an express purpose. 
:::::::::::- Yes, in that we may be agreed. The amendments referred to above only made abundantly clear to the folks reading law, that they would be mistaken were they to believe that the character of the states was unaltered by the sovereign people since 1775 by either their first United States constitution, or its second. Over the course of events in that national perpetual union, it mattered to make it clear at some length that the character of the states had in fact changed since 1775, sir, since that misunderstanding led to the late unpleasantness between the states, to which I believe you do now obliquely refer.

== If Puerto Rico Were a State, Electoral Votes ==

The following paragraph from the article is not entirely correct:

:"The Twenty-third Amendment (1961) grants presidential electors to the District of Columbia. DC has three votes in the Electoral College as though it were a state with two senators and one representative in perpetuity. If Puerto Rico were given the same consideration, it would have seven Electoral College votes."
:
If the Twenty-Third Amendment were applied to Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico would have the right to appoint three electors, not seven.

The Amendment states, in part,

:"The District constituting the seat of Government of the United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct:
:
:"A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State..."
:
So as long as there are states that have only one Representative in Congress, the number of electors that may be appointed by the District of Columbia is limited to three no matter how large their population gets.

== Qualifications to be President of the United States ==

The U.S. Constitution, as it stands now, does not allow a woman to be president of the United States.  The reason being Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Article II make it very clear by the use (twenty times) of the masculine pronouns, “he” and “his” that the drafters intended that only a man could be president.   The drafters intent is further evidenced by the fact that they did not give women the right to vote plus who among them would have thought that a woman could be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States?[[User:Craryja|Craryja]] ([[User talk:Craryja|talk]]) 19:40, 16 September 2012 (UTC)

::Sorry, your concern is '''linguistic''', not legal, philosophical or political. English is inherently messy. "He", like "Los" in Spanish or "Les" in French, may be either masculine, or masculine AND feminine. Also, there is a crying need for second person plural, because "you" means both "usted" and "ustedes". This is supplied by English dialects everywhere, hence my favorite '''second person plural''', ''y'all'' and ''you-all'' (south), but also ''you-uns'' (appalacian), ''yous'', ''guys'' and ''yous-guys'' (mid-atlantic). [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 12:53, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

:::Yes and no.  You might be oversimplifying things a bit.  First, every "linguistic concern" in a legal document including the constitution is a "legal concern".  Secondly, yes, there are gender-neutral forms in English that are spelled out in the masculine.  "Mankind", "Penmanship", "History of Man", etc.  Further "He" is an appropriate substitute for "He/She".  HOWEVER, that aside, there is no doubt that the framers were using it in a far more gender specific manner: They did '''not''' intend for women to vote, nor did they '''ever''' conceive of a woman commander in chief.[[User:Tgm1024|Tgm1024]] ([[User talk:Tgm1024|talk]]) 14:28, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

::::Except he TVH isn't oversimplifying things. Even Justice Scalia wouldn't look to that particular bit of original intent.

::::Look at the qualifications for a representative: "No Person shall be a Representative who shall not...be an Inhabitant of that State in which ''he'' shall be chosen." And those for a senator: "No Person shall be a Senator who shall not...be an Inhabitant of that State for which ''he'' shall be chosen." Also, look at the language that necessitated Hillary Clinton's [[Saxbe fix]]: "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during ''his'' Continuance in Office." And are female fugitives from justice not subject to extradition? Because here is what that text says, "A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which ''he'' fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime." There is also the 6th Amendment: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right...to be confronted with the witnesses against ''him''; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in ''his'' favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for ''his'' defence." (Emphasis added in all quotations.) The 20th Amendment uses the male pronoun to refer to the president in 1967, decades after women had already begun to serve, notwithstanding the male pronoun being used in the first two passages cited above.

:- '''1)''' Tgm1024 shifts the ground a bit. We began the discussion over the constitution '''as it stands now''', which as amended, has been ruled in federal court to universally include women in all its terms and phrases. 
:- '''2)''' When the constitution was drafted, New Jersey allowed '''women voting''' when they met the same property requirements as men – mostly widows at the time. There was no provision to review or reverse state laws in Congress, Madison's suggestion to that effect was voted down in the constitutional convention.
:- The '''federal nature of the union''' found in articles IV - VII allowed women to '''a)''' persist in voting where they did, '''b)''' gain the vote in states where they did not, 41 of the 48 in some way by 1920. See [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution#Background|map]],  '''c)''' lose the vote, as New Jersey did by the same men who ratified the Constitution when they met in state legislature, see [[Pauline Maier]]'s "Ratification". But that original intent, such as it may be, does not pertain to the constitution '''as it stands now'''.
:- '''d)''' The "federal nature of the union" forbade interference by the FEDERAL government in the states to protect the woman vote – until the 14th Amendment, when rights and privileges were uniformly extended to every STATE government, -- then '''e)''' the 19th Amendment required women’s vote for FEDERAL elections in all the states, '''as it stands now'''.  
:- '''3)''' Women were '''conceived''' as commander-in-chief from the start, see [[Rousseau]], his General Will is explicitly "men and women", also Abigail Adams, but such idealists did not then have the votes for the requisite majorities to impose their will. 
:- '''4)''' Nevertheless, the '''original intent''' of the framers was to confer upon U.S. citizens the widest possible privileges under the most expansive rights of any nation on earth conceived up until that time, and they intended their creation to be amended in ways THEY had not conceived, and so wrote Article V to amend it, for us the LIVING to use, '''as it stands now'''.

:- Good point, I may have not been clear. Lots of folks here confound (a) the ''freedom of states'' versus (b) the ''freedom of individuals''. The short answer is, The Constitution operates on individuals, not states. As explained in the Federalist Papers before we got this thing ''res republica'' started, if the national government operated on states, every geographical conflict would become an invitation to civil war. Then came the Whisky Rebellion right off the bat!
:- One reader's background speaks to (a) the sovereignty of the STATES, the other to (b) the sovereignty of the PEOPLE. One view would have (a) states with the right to hold any individual as a slaves, the other would have (b) any individual held as a slave to be free in every state. The preamble is pretty clear, it is (a) We the PEOPLE, not (b) we the states. 
:- You are perhaps referring to the doctrine,'''“Freedom is not possible without slavery.”''' found in the Richmond ''Enquirer'', April 15, '''1856''', quoted in Oakes, “The Ruling Race”, 141 and placed in context north and south perspectives in Chapter 8, “The counter-evolution in 1861”, page 244, in James M. McPherson’s Pulitzer prize winning  [http://books.google.com/books?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&q=definition#v=onepage&q=definition&f=false| Battle Cry of Freedom], 1988, viewed November 14, 2012. An alternative recent treatment of the definition of ‘freedom’ from another historical tradition is found in Eric Foner’s “The Story of American Freedom” 1998. 
:- The tragic misunderstanding is sorted out during the civil war, and codified in the Constitution in the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. Most importantly, the 14th because for the FIRST time, an Amendment applies not only to (a) limiting the power and possible oppressions of the FEDERAL government, but the Constitution is (b) extended to protect the rights of the people against their STATES. I believe all modern amendments explicitly carry forward that 14th Amendment phrasing to operate on (a) BOTH federal and state governments for the sake of we the living sovereign PEOPLE, and not exempting (b) the legally subordinate creatures of the people, the states.

It takes about 35 years of persistent majorities in Congress on a subject to see the Supreme Court reflect a change of its constitutional understanding. The 14th Amendment began the re-education of the Supreme Court and federal jurisprudence. Nothing happens here overnight. A viewpoint must prevail AND be sustained to take hold.

== San Marino has the oldest constitution ==

Many students in the US are taught that America has the oldest constitution, however there is a [[Constitution_of_San_Marino]] written in 1600. On these talk pages over the years, the debate is repeated every archive. 

(1) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_1#Not_the_oldest_constitution]] (2005) the facts of the matter are not debated and the article changed.

(2) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_2#Oldest_constitution.2C_again]] (2006) claim that the 1600 law was not a constitution because other important laws were later added, which is irrelevant as pointed out at the time. 

(3) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_3#San_Marino.3F_not]] (2007) claim that the status of the 1600 law was was disputed, but concludes "No evidence sofar of a dispute among scholars".

(4) [[Talk:United States Constitution/Archive 3#Statutes of 1600]] (2008) complains the then wikipedia article mentions about a dispute among scholars about San Marino without any evidence.

(5) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_3#San_Marino.2FMedina]] editors are trying to make sense of why San Marino constitution is being dismissed or disputed. Conclusion: "By what silliness does one country's constitution be counted as 'real' or 'true' but not another?"

(6) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_3#The first constitution]] No disagreement that San Marino is the oldest constitution.

(7) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_4#The oldest constitution in the world?]] (2009) It is claimed that San Marino does not have a written constitution, because only parts of it are written (no references offered).

(8) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_4#The oldest one?]] (2009) "It's only the shortest one, being the oldest the Constitution of San Marino", no further debate.

(9) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_5#Oldest_constitution:_US_vs_San_Marino]] (2010) argument that "considering the size of the population living under it, makes San Marino rather insignificant by comparison [to the US]" (which is irrelevant)

(10) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_5#Shortest and oldest constitution]] (2010) "I don't know about shortest, but it definitively isn't oldest.", no further debate.

(11) [[Talk:United_States_Constitution/Archive_6#San_Marino.27s_constitution.28s.29]] (2011) argument that San Marino may not be a self-governing nation-state comparable to the United States, because Italy broadcasts there (irrelevant in 1600) and because the 1600 constitution used Italians as judges (no source provided).

The answer to this question is very simple: 
(1) San Marino is recognised as a nation, (it's size is irrelevant)
(2) It has a supreme law describing its government that was written in 1600 (in Latin) and there was never any dispute about it. 
(3) That 1600 law is in force. 
(4) Just like the US, other constitutional laws have been added, and these two laws (electoral law and human rights law) recognize the 1600 law as the original law in their preambles. 
(5) San Marino does not need to follow American constitutional notions to have a constitution (unless the claim is that the US has the oldest American-style constitution)
(6) The San Marino 1600 laws describe the governance of San Marino (unlike the Magna Carta)

Regarding the politics of editing this page:

(1) Some people in any country will exaggerate the claims of their country and continue their national myths, even if it means inventing implausible or fictional arguments. I thought the broadcasting rights argument was amazing. 

(2) It seems that only a few wikipedia editors are responsible for pushing an agenda and it's obviously going to be pointless to argue with them. It's why I left wikipedia about six years ago.

(3) In wikipedia in other languages, the age of the San Marino constitution is not disputed. So the rest of the world knows the simple truth.

(4) I think it is insulting to the highly-regarded reputation of the US constitution and its positive, lasting influence on the world, that such silliness is published and defended.

(5) The US has so many important and significant firsts, that it strikes me as extremely petty for citizens of a giant superpower to seek to "dispute" this curiosity from a tiny country. It informs us more about the fragility of American pride in some people (but I know many Americans with a real pride in their country).

No, I'm not going to argue the point... just look to the previous arguments.

::::- But the only argument that needs to be lined up is that the two constitutions are of different kinds, so its apples and oranges. As explained before on this talk page.

Among the states of the U.S., I believe that John Adams early on, 1774? laid out a blue print for legislatures representing Americans to create their own state constitutions to supercede their colonial charters, and Massachusetts may have been the first (oldest) because his cousin Sam Adams and John Hancock prevailed in the Massachusetts legislature.

:Even some of what you list points to the document being part of San Marino's constitution without being the sum total of its constitution, as is the case with the US Constitution. "A type of informal constitution" is not a written constitution. Notably, when San Marino has added things to its constitution, it has simply passed a completely new law. In the United States, and in other jurisdictions with written constitutions, it is necessary to actually amend the written constitution under its own terms. What you are not getting is the distinction between this sort of document and the looser arrangement of San Marino. Yes, San Marino has a document of constitutional significance that is older, but that document is not a written constitution. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 21:30, 15 October 2012 (UTC)
::Saying "that document is not a written constitution" contradicts the sources. I probably do understand that a 16th century constitution will not have the same qualities as one from the 18th. Unsurprising you picked out the comment saying it was "informal". I doubt it was informal in 1599; more that legal standards improved in the intervening 187 years? or it is that the document does not say "Constitution" in its title.

::But I can show, more easily that this distinction between written and unwritten is about explaining the English system. Did you notice the 1835 encyclopedia article on constitutions does not even mention a "written constitution"? [[A. V. Dicey]] writes that "When we call the Constitution unwritten we mean ..." and uses "the [capital C] Constitution" to show he trying to explain the United Kingdom, not an abstract nation ( [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=Xlo2Kx92u2YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=An+Introduction+to+the+Study+of+the+Law+of+the+Constitution&source=bl&ots=gfLzyWOb4b&sig=X3snF2giVj0CLEUKK_Ak7h4_8Is&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ei=aXZ9UKPsJaSWiQesw4CwBA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=written&f=false] p68-69).

::Dicey also explains that "where a constitution is written or enacted the articles are frequently but by no means always 'rigid'; they cannot that is be by the ordinary legislative power".

:::Saying it is a written constitution contradicts the sources. It is a constitutional document—a part of a constitution—not a constitution.

::::San Marino can pass additional constitutionally significant laws, such as the 1974 Declaration of Citizen rights, without resetting the age of its written constitution. The way the USA amends its constitution is not binding on San Marino at all. They can organise any constitutional document structure they like, and if it is written, it's written.

"As the political scientist Jorri Duursma notes, "'''San Marino does not have an official Constitution''' as such.

There is no "charter Constitution" outside of the sitting legislature, the sovereignty of the nation is in the legislature, so it is different from and other than "charter Constitutions" which derive their authority from the people, from an authority above and outside of the legislature, such as that found in the Constitutions of the United States or France.

:::::Certainly, none of that is true, except for the first word. You're not going to find any sources for these claims. Some of them are absurd. Since there is a wide range of views in the secondary sources, what happens if I look at the primary document?

The first article reads like a preamble and refers to the people's authority. There's sections about reforming the law (riformazioni), how votes are counted. If the Captains interfere with the courts, they can be deprived of their office. Anyway, I cannot quote from the primary sources. Nevertheless, 61 pages is a lot of written constitution. The 1974 Declaration of Citizens' Rights is 4 pages, but it is in English.

:- Please assume a less dismissive tone. The business -- about how a PhD says there is no constitution, because he would help you distinguish between two classes of constitution which are generally understood by students of government and political science -- is called, in logic and in rhetoric, reducing your opponents argument to absurdity, [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In high school and college debate, you will have points deducted from your side for using either faulty logic or an oratorical trick. Debate judges are neither amused nor impressed, unlike the reporters passing along candidate-employee recaps after a presidential debate in the spin room for national television instant analysis. Here, it just means you have violated one of the pillars of wikidom, collegiality.

:: I reject your criticism for the following reasons: (1) As proven above, Rjensen modified other pages in Wikipedia to help bolster his position in this talk (2) As proven above, he falsely quoted sources and inserted them directly into the articles (if he is a PhD student, he should know better) (3) He tried to twist Wikipedia policy to mean tertiary sources could not be discussed, when in fact it says to use them in this and some other circumstances (4) I used [[Reductio ad absurdum]] fairly with respect to the United States has a partially unwritten constitution. It's not a fallacious technique; I've backed it up with sources; and it is not intended to prove it has an unwritten constitution, but that being written is a matter of degree, which it is (5) I am happy to deduct "debating points" for cherry-picking and not providing sources. (6) I can also be concerned about dismissiveness, because a large number of sources (above) are being ignored. (7) There was no doubt from the beginning, that the maintainers of this page will not alter a of this claim.

:- Sources abound establishing '''Magna Carta''' as is a written constitution for the English in 1215, I believe there are earlier such 'written constitutions' elsewhere in Europe. For instance, the golden age of the '''Republic of Florence''' begins with the constitution of 1343, earlier "Captains" as you properly call them, were elected in Florence as a legislative body in the mid-1200s. See William R. Everdell, "The end of kings: the history of republics and republicans", {{ISBN|978-0-226-22482-4}}, pp.87-107.

:- ''There is no need to rehearse either the '''history of written''' constitutions, nor the '''history of republics''' in the U.S. Constitution article introduction.''  A couple years ago, I think an earlier version of the section on the 'origins of the constitution' had my contribution referring to the Republic of Venice as a model, quoting from the Federalist Papers, but I think that that was overwritten months ago. Regardless, INTRODUCTIONS require very concise, [[WP:SUMMARY]] style.
:- I like San Marino. San Marino made one of my heros, Abraham Lincoln, a citizen during his lifetime. San Marino has published beautiful stamps since 1877. When I was a boy, I had a 1920s commemorative stamp in my collection showing the three fortresses on the mountain. My family has great stories of Italy and Italians. My grandparents saw Etna erupt in 1928. The first place I ever saw city streets washed clean in the morning by fire hydrants was in Milan in the 1960s.

::A little bit off-topic. I've presented numerous sources which refer to San Marino having an older constitution and a written constitution. Most constitutional law books say that there are aspects of unwritten and written law in every constitution, for example: [http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8fgVpN0bDhUC&lpg=PA85&ots=khhlRpa1gg&dq=written%20unwritten%20constitutions&hl=zh-CN&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=written%20unwritten%20constitutions&f=false] "the difference between [written or unwritten] is one of degree and not of kind" (p85) and this source specifically discusses the Magna Carta (p84). If you want to be strict about it, the short United States constitution would also have an unwritten constitution based on the 4 sources provided earlier. My source also says "The Constitution of England is the one solitary example of an unwritten or evolved constitution in the present world.

::After reviewing five years of archived discussion, plus this discussion, there is still no source stating unequivocally that San Marino doesn't have a written constitution. Given that there are many which do say it does have one, and that the constitution comes from the Statutes of 1600, it is time to revisit the claim in the summary. [[Special:Contributions/221.219.127.184|221.219.127.184]] ([[User talk:221.219.127.184|talk]]) 13:26, 21 October 2012 (UTC) 

:- [off topic] Ah, I see we have someone trained in the Oxford debate style. I loved watching on cable TV a Brit, atheist [[Christopher Hitchens]] and an Indian, Anglican [[Dinesh D'Souza]], have at it across the U.S. talk circuit in their debates about God, religion, relativity, creationism, Darwinism, etc. incredibly rich stuff. A noble tradition we can all profit from. Good to have you here. that said off topic, 
:- '''(1)''' I do not understand the selection of San Marino as the vehicle for addressing the article's introductory claim except that you did your homework and reading the discussion you sought common ground with editors who had weighed in previously. With that sort of preparation apparent on your part, if I go to court, I want you on my side. 
:- '''(2)''' So, at the link you provided above, the third edition of “Political Science” by D.K. Sarmah, we see on [[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=8fgVpN0bDhUC&lpg=PA85&ots=khhlRpa1gg&dq=written%20unwritten%20constitutions&hl=zh-CN&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=magna%20carta&f=false| page 84]], -- when you click, wait just a moment, on my browser, the translation from Chinese will appear in English automatically --  “It is significant to remember that an unwritten constitution is not completely devoid of written elements. As for example, the Constitution of the U.K. which is cited as an ideal example of an unwritten constitution contains written parts like the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Act of Settlement, judicial decisions, etc., over and above the customs and conventions.“ 
:- That is to say, by the D.K. Sarmah reference, ''the British written Constitution is older than that of the San Marino''. And that continuous use by San Marino was interrupted by the Fascists. So, we should drop San Marino. Likewise, substantial revision of the constitutions in the republic of Switzerland, also a model for the U.S. Constitution, like that of Venice, can be dismissed for our purposes here at the WP.U.S.Constitution. Further, in the case Switzerland, I am uneasy about admitting Switzerland to the same class of constitutions, since citizenship is expanded only by internal increase: both parents must be Swiss, or the children can never be. A nation-state may not be considered "modern" if its standard of citizenship is akin to the ancient Hindu tradition of both parents Hindu as a precondition for a child's salvation. I prefer the tradition of the ancient Greek city-state democracy: citizenship by birth on the soil of the sovereign territory. 

:- '''(3)''' If we continue with Sarmah, -- and we should, since he has much important to say about making a multi-religious, multi-national modern nation-state work in peace and prosperity -- since the rulings of the Supreme Court interpret the U.S. Constitution, Sarmah would have it, as a matter of jurisprudence, in a practical way, that the U.S. constitution is the same as the English. ''But we are not practicing law, we are writing for a general audience about the forms of government''. 
:- [aside] You mentioned the "short" U.S. Constitution. There is no inherent virtue in the length of a Constitution. Without much ambiguity and little detail, there would have been no U.S. nation-state. Without much more detail and much less ambiguity, there would have been no India nation-state. Nationalists as diverse as Abraham Lincoln, Benito Juarez and Sun Yat-sen took from all sorts of traditions and innovations in combination to invent their country for the people living in it -- to protect the life, liberty and their pursuit of happiness -- and if not the pursuit of "property" as in the U.S. tradition, pursuit of "socialism" as in the preamble of the Constitution of India.]
:- Therefore it is useful to make a distinction between constitutions which are written as a charter -- beginning a nation-state, -- such as the United States, the French, the Indian, the Japanese, -- versus those which '''have no one date''' of ordaining inauguration of its constitutions. In doing that, it is fair to make the claim, that the U.S. Constitution is the ''oldest written national constitution in continuous use'', with a link defining a written constitution as a set of fundamental principals, rules that constitute what the entity is, and “When these principles are written down into a single collection or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to comprise a '''written constitution'''.” 
:- Or, '''what wording would you propose''' to make a statement about the duration of the U.S. Constitution in the article introduction -- which is neutral in an internationally, scholarly way?

::(1) I discuss this at the beginning summarising discussion over several years. The US is has become benchmark written constitution and it's circular reasoning to call it the oldest only based on that analysis, where there is an alternative claim which is certainly older.
::(2) The British constitution is older than the US, and the Magna Carta has some clauses valid still today. The commentary and analysis almost universally refers to the UK constitution as unwritten, for a variety of well-explained reasons. I see no reason to deviate from this view and I'd go further to say that the English have the benchmark unwritten constitution, and I think that is even recognised by Canadian law.
::(2a) San Marino's territorial sovereignty was violated in 1944 as Italy was invaded, however I haven't read anything to say an occupying government was established or the Sanmarinese government suspended. 
::(3) I wouldn't be concerned that the US constitution has evolved unwritten parts, except that the argument was put that because the Sanmarinese constitution has reformations* (functioning as amendments), an entrenched citizens-rights charter and some unwritten elements, it was not a written constitution. (*some translations just say "reforms".)
::The problem with your analysis, is you're assuming that the 1600 statutes are like the Magna Carta, however they are completely, completely different. The Magna Carta is focused on a new settlement between the King and aristocracy. The 1600 statutes are a detailed codification of all the law in San Marino, with a 16th century conception of compiling it together in one collection of books. Maybe they did it because the old books were falling apart, or because they'd learnt something from the renaissance and wanted an up-to-date set of laws.
::(4) I would propose that you write something less definitive. A pleasant way to put it is "the oldest constitution of its kind ..." and allow the remainder of the paragraph says that most other countries copied this kind of constitution. The qualities of nation, federal, democratic are felt in such a phrase without getting stuck on the precise definition.

:::And multiple editors have rejected your proposal. The San Marino document is part of a constitution. It isn't even the only document that is part of that constitution. You can argue that the US having unwritten constitutional whatsits all you wan't, but that is your belief, and you can't find other documents that form part of the US's constitution. Your blithe dismissal of Magna Carta isn't persuasive in the least. You also try to dismiss the question of whether San Marino has even had sovereign, but that is of vital importance. San Marino's document cannot be the "oldest written national constitution in continuous use" when it has not continuously been an independent nation for the relevant period.

==It CAN Be Changed==
The line about how the US Constitution is unusual because it can't be changed; instead, it is amended - is absolutely ridiculous.  ''Of course'', the Constitution CAN be changed.  That is what an amendment IS - it is a change to the Constitution.

What is unusual, as compared to most state constitutions within the USA, is that the amendments are not incorporated into the main text of the document; they are appended to it.  That way, it is patently clear that each amendment applies to the entire Constitution, including all amendments that preceded it in time.

As to the arguments below, the oldest charter of supreme law in continuous use is Magna Charta - which is Latin for "Great Charter".  So, be careful what you're calling a "charter".

Besides which, charters are granted by a sovereign authority.  Thus, Magna Charta is a charter, because it was granted by the sovereign.  The Charter of the City and County of San Francisco is a charter because it was granted by the sovereign state of California.  A corporate charter is a charter because it, too, is granted by a sovereign state.

The US Constitution was not granted by a sovereign but drafted by delegates representing the federal sovereign entity called the United States - so it is not a charter; it is a constitution.

As written constitutions go, the Constitution of Vermont dates from 1777 and is still in use, so it is older than the US Constitution - which, by its terms (see Amendment X), is the supreme law of the land but only within the jurisdiction of the federal United States; the individual states are not subordinate to the federal state but are co-equal to it, because they exercise the sovereign powers that the US Constitution does not allow the federal government to exercise.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.181.62.103|69.181.62.103]] ([[User talk:69.181.62.103|talk]]) 21:34, 12 January 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Introduction: “oldest written national constitution”   ==

Excerpt from discussion above:
:- What wording would you propose to make a statement about the duration of the U.S. Constitution in the article introduction -- which is neutral in an internationally scholarly way? [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 09:54, 22 October 2012 (UTC) 
::I would propose that you write something less definitive.

:- From the discussion and reading into references cited elsewhere here at Talk, there are aspects of constitutions treated from parliamentary traditions of study which most U.S. political science scholarship does not address. I propose to refine the introduction to be more internationally inclusive as follows: 

:-- '''Intro paragraph #4''' amend to:  “The Constitution guides American society in [[law]] and [[political culture]]. It is the oldest constitution of its kind, and it influenced later international figures establishing national constitutions. Recent impulses for reform center on concerns for extending [[democracy]] and [[Taxing and Spending Clause#Restrictions on spending|balancing the federal budget]]. “ [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 12:15, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

Excellent.  Well, I shall quibble a little, but at last we concentrate on how to rewrite the intro, or specifically Paragraph 4. Questions of what's a "charter constitution" and why San Marino counts or does not count belong in their respective articles, their relevance here being scant.  Now down to brass tacks.  I prefer: 
:“The Constitution guides American society in [[law]] and [[political culture]]. [[Founding Fathers of the United States of America|Its writers]] incorporated recent developments in [[constitutional theory]], and their work influenced later writers of [[constitution]]s for other nations. It has been [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|ammended]] over the centuries.  Being shorter than other constitutions it is supplemented and interpreted by a large body of [[United States constitutional law]]. “

This allusion to the seniority question is even vaguer, which I think appropriate to a complex yet trivial question.  My second sentence connects to the way the original document both followed and set precedents, and the final sentence points the way to the fact that much more is involved than just the document itself.  And it ignores the question of future ammendments, which don't belong in the intro.  But, that said, I like your version a lot more than the current.  [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 16:00, 24 October 2012 (UTC) 

:Sorry, no. The primacy issue has to be dealt with as it will be added back at some point. It is so commonly trotted out that a properly qualified version is necessary. IP's contention that San Marino's document counts even though it is just a part of the written portion of San Marino's constitution and San Marino wasn't always a sovereign state is simply unacceptable. I agree that none of that needs to be discussed in the article, but bowing to nonsense is equally foolish. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 16:24, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

:- @ Rrius. very well. "Primacy" of the U.S. Constitution may be imperfectly arrived at in collaboration by using "first of its kind". 
:- @ Jim.henderson. At [[WP:BETTER#Lead section]], “The lead should … include mention of consequential or significant criticism or controversies … “ In this article of an historical document, I am not sure whether the principle should apply. But by way of explanation, 
:- I thought, what better '''concise way''' of communicating significant criticism than alluding to efforts to amend the constitution itself by the representatives of the very populace living under its governance. In the past, favorites have been suggested but taken off by consensus, the "Introduction" standard for inclusion being categories of those amendments sponsored by triple-digit numbers among U.S. Representatives and Senators sustained over more than one Congress, and to avoid a laundry list of various editors favorites jammed into the introduction. 
:- Hence the last sentence encompasses liberal (democratic-e.g. direct election of president) and conservative (federal budget-e.g. balanced budget) concerns in '''two general categories''' aggregating several specific proposals by that objective criteria in the way rendered:  “Recent impulses for reform center on concerns for extending democracy and balancing the federal budget.” [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 20:20, 24 October 2012 (UTC) 

::- can we say, Introduction, paragraph #4. 
::- :“The Constitution guides American society in [[law]] and [[political culture]]. [[Founding Fathers of the United States of America|Its writers]] composed the first constitution of its kind incorporating recent developments in [[constitutional theory]] with multiple traditions, and their work influenced later writers of national [[constitution]]s. It has been [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amended]] over time and it is supplemented and interpreted by a large body of [[United States constitutional law]]. Recent impulses for reform center on concerns for extending [[democracy]] and [[Taxing and Spending Clause#Restrictions on spending|balancing the federal budget]].“

:::"Recent impulses for reform center on concerns for extending [[democracy]]" -- I assume that's a reference to the electoral college, but it should be better defined, and dealt with in the actual article.  And balancing the federal budget should probably link to [[balanced budget amendment]] since that's less of an [[WP:EGG|Easter egg]] '''[[User talk:Hot Stop|<span style="font-family: symbol;"><span style="color:#0d254c">Hot Stop</span></span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Hot_Stop|<span style="font-family: symbol;"><span style="color:#0d254c">(Edits)</span></span>]]''' 06:17, 25 October 2012 (UTC)
::::- Agreed on both counts. In addition to the direct popular election which the article should address, there is also the district plan used in Maine and Nebraska, and voted down recently in California? Though as I remember a district plan would have resulted with the same percent split in California as the actual popular vote there. Maybe a dozen states have tried it, mostly during early expansions of universal manhood suffrage, then ended with the advent of 19th Century machine party politics ...
::::- Advocates argue that the diversity of each state would be reflected in the district E.C. votes, the state majority in the two at-large, the tombstones voted in some districts could never count more than the weight of those living there in the national total, so every contested election would not end up as awarded by federal judges ... 
::::- by the way, recent electoral-map speculation of an E.C. tie 269-269 assumes Obama cannot take the one urban district electoral vote up for grabs in Omaha City, or rather it omits consideration of a repeat there from the last election, where Nebraska split 4-1. For small states, the district plan means there is no more "fly-over" country. Interesting ground-game election this year. 
::::- Could you give the wording a try to replace "extending democracy" -- referring somehow to "direct election of president" -- since that is the proposal in that direction with the most backing in Congress? [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 08:27, 25 October 2012 (UTC)
:::Splendid.  Well, I don't see a good way to insinuate direct election, but our latest Virginia draft gives three quarters of what I wanted, and it's definitely the better three quarters and better worded.  Perhaps we can insert it later today.  [[User:Jim.henderson|Jim.henderson]] ([[User talk:Jim.henderson|talk]]) 11:00, 25 October 2012 (UTC)

:::::- Thanks. A final quibble, in the spirit of Jim.henerson's 'three-quarters' rule for collaboration, I do not agree with dropping 'society' but I will CONCUR the with the Rrius amendment for later today:
:::::- DROPPING "society" is weird if we are persuaded by the [[Brandeis Brief]] that society is apart from the political culture, and the LAW should should serve the PEOPLE in their changing circumstances, and NOT the living people serving unchanging law set in precedent. Or it may be that I reread the [[Federalist Papers]] too recently. Never mind. Let's take care of the U.S. constitutional 'primacy' and put 'San Marino' to rest later today. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 14:17, 25 October 2012 (UTC)
:::::I don't understand what you are saying in terms of your argument for keeping in "society", why you are talking about things happening "later today", or whether you are saying you are standing by or waiving your objection. The "guiding society" sentence may have some meaning, but that meaning is unclear. If you take out "society in", it would read "The Constitution guides American law and political culture." That sentence is true enough, though a better verb might help. Political culture isn't intentional or, generally, something people are conscious of, which makes the concept of Society being guided by it unclear. So, at best, the current version is hard to understand, and at worst it doesn't mean anything. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 06:48, 26 October 2012 (UTC)

Hi, this article contains a substantive error in the following excerpt from the wiki page as currently written: " 'For example, the First Amendment - "Congress shall make no law" establishing a religion ...'

I understand that "establishing a religion" is not within quotes and therefore is an attempt to paraphrase the sentence. However, the paraphrase "establishing a religion" is a loaded interpretation of the original phrase "respecting an establishment of religion" (provided below citing national archives" 

Given that this wiki article is not attempting to interpret the Constitution but rather explain it, and given the parsing, dicing, and divisiveness concerning interpretation and use of specific words much less understanding the specific intent behind the words, I think the simple edit of this line to reflect the actual phrase "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion... is in the public's best interest.


http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html
Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

There is no reliable source that will say that the U.S. Constitution cannot be changed. [[User:Famspear|Famspear]] ([[User talk:Famspear|talk]]) 17:28, 25 January 2013 (UTC)

OK, I corrected the weird language in the article, which misleadingly stated that the Constitution could not be "changed." Saying that the Constitution cannot be "changed" is like saying that statutes cannot be changed, or that case law cannot be changed.

The error is based on a misunderstanding about how the Constitution is physically published. It would be correct to say that the Constitution itself ''is not codified''. What that means is that amendments are published at the end of the original text, rather than being incorporated into the "original" text as new amendments are added. The fact that the text -- as published -- is not ''codified'' is not the same as saying that the Constitution is not "changed."

Similarly, the statute books published by the United States Government Printing Office, known as the "United States Statutes at Large," which show (among other things) Acts of Congress as published in chronological order, are not physically codified ''within those books themselves''. (Many of the statutes ''are codified'', but that is done in a ''separate'' publication known as the "United States Code"; that's a separate issue.) In other words, if a new statute in 2013 repeals or changes a statute enacted in, say, 1993, the 1993 volume or volumes of the actual, physical publication known as the United States Statutes at Large would not be "reorganized" and "reprinted" with the year 2013 material incorporated into the 1993 volume.

Similarly, if a given court decision is overturned in a later year, the actual physical law book reporting the original case is not "reprinted" with the old case deleted.

That is not the same as saying that the case law in the original case, or the law in the original statute, etc., isn't being "changed."

The article language was indeed misleading. [[User:Famspear|Famspear]] ([[User talk:Famspear|talk]]) 17:40, 25 January 2013 (UTC) 

:The wording of the original seven Articles is NOT changed. Following European precedent, redrafting the entire constitution to insert the new wording would change previous meaning. Instead Amendments are subtended below the Articles. The Courts are left with the task of reconciling interpretations of the articles and amendments with each other. I propose,
* ''"The first seven articles are not rewritten at each amendment. Changes in the supreme law of the land are re-interpreted by the federal courts taking the entire Constitution as amended in view."''

== American constitution was inspired by the Warsaw Confederation (religious tolerance act) ==

Hey, I found an interesting link. It seems that the religious tolerance embedded in American constitution was inspired by Warsaw Confederation (an act of religious tolerance guaranteeing freedom of religion and their equality), said Jefferson:

Poland as a then 'modern' example of a republic to study, Poland even made it into the Federalist Papers because its King was elected by the national legislature for life --- with Washington in mind a serious consideration for the U.S. --- but that provision for the term of the chief magistrate was voted down in Convention.

== Intercourse and sex ==

We write for the modern reader. Esoglou missed earlier discussion on 19th century American idiom. Contemporary 1920 ‘Intercourse’ meant “trade”, and ‘sex’ meant “gender” in modern usage. In the text, the 19th Amendment (1920) “prohibited federal government and states from forbidding a citizen's vote [[women’s suffrage|due to gender]].” The link is to women’s suffrage, <nowiki>[women’s suffrage|due to their gender]</nowiki>, which does not explore their sex, it discusses their vote. Reverted to 'gender' until further discussion. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 11:14, 25 May 2013 (UTC)
:The nineteenth amendment states: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."  Why raise the question of the meaning of "intercourse" in 1920 (20th century, not 19th) or 2013, a word that appears neither in the amendment nor in the edit that you reverted?  Why not quote the amendment faithfully and then, if necessary (but is it?), add a sourced non-original-research comment on any pertinent difference between the 1920 and the 2013 understanding of a person's sex?  (Surely it's a one-track mind that would make it mean nothing but sexual ''intercourse'' by the person. That can't be what you mean.)

::The constitution article need not directly quote lengthy passages from any amendment because they begin each subarticle, see [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]]. You have now extended the passage outside encyclopedic style. The idea is communicate to modern readers the ''information'' that women who could vote in over twenty states for school boards, mayors, state or federal officials in some states would then be qualified to vote for federal officials in every state. 
::There is no need to refer to "sex" when gender is the clear meaning, and not the titillation of a late-night monologue for modern readers. In this case, longer is not better, and you should know better --- wait a minute --- WP is your joke. I get it. Esoglou is very clever, dressed in underwear all tied up on her talk page. Should we include a quote from the opponents of women suffrage concerning early 20th century women's inability to grasp serious political matters? No, no, then there would be two jokes about women voting -- one is enough for each WP article.

Okay, apart from your joke, in relation to the 19th Amendment, reliable sources do not use ‘sex’ to describe ‘gender’ for the modern reader.

* Scholarly source: [http://books.google.com/books?id=h3itDekmfAIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=womens+suffrage+for+gender&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4mmmUdTFLq2q4APRyIDwAQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=womens%20suffrage%20for%20gender&f=false Splintered Sisterhood: gender and class] in the campaign against woman suffrage. By Susan Marshall. Suffrage and anti-suffrage was “grounded in the politics of gender and class”. [p.xi]. 
There is no provision to remove voting rights from transgender persons who have voluntarily altered gender to realize a personal ambition for an alternative private identity. Voting is based on US citizens resident in their state or territory one year or less -- it is not restricted by their 'gender' or your 'sex' anywhere in the US.

::I am so sorry, you are using a search engine without regard to substance, settling for tertiary sources using 'sex' to convey the language of the 1920 amendment, when we have secondary government and scholarly sources available to show you how to convey the meaning clearly with 'gender', without titillating modern readers using 'sex'. You asked for use of the word 'gender' to describe women suffrage, it is given. You fear for those of a third gender but we expand the suffrage to include all citizens apart from sexual orientation or identity, multiple expressions of personality, -- we do that in part by using "gender' not 'sex' -- which can not only be flirting among the very young, but provoking angry opposition in some groups.
::The encyclopedia article can use 'gender' in the constitution narrative for clarity, the sub-article can use 'sex' in its historical context without being controversial. The WP audience is general international readership, including those using English as a second or third language. In the modern era, 'sex' refers to sexual activity, and 'gender' is seen as a synonym. Among feminist, women's or gender studies, the distinction is made between biological 'sex' and the social construct of 'gender', which allows for all persons of whatever cultural sexual roles they assume in a social or political context. You seem to be earnest, not joking (!?) --- if so, I apologize.

I would like to propose a simple addition of one sentence, extracted from the Articles of Confederation page, to be inserted after the first sentence in this section. The current reading is:

The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was the first constitution of the United States of America.[3] The chief problem with the new government under the Articles of Confederation was, in the words of George Washington, "no money."[4]

I would like to see this sentence inserted immediately after reference [3]:

Its drafting by the Continental Congress began in mid-1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777. The formal ratification by all 13 states was completed in early 1781.

my history books never failed to mention, and always made clear this:

There were several competing constitutions and the convention bickeded continually in the heat, and if i remember Thomas Jefferson worded the drafts.  That the two basic lines were those for indirect democracy ruled by polititians and those set against it.  That in every paragraph one can see a dividing line between the conflicting interests.

who worded the various drafts ?  that was thomas jefferson is that right ?

During the time many countries such as France 
had already been doing similar revolutions.

Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence

Thomas Jefferson

1776

Note: Italicized words or phrases were omitted in the final draft.
Bracketed words or phrases were added to the original draft and appear in the final draft.

A Declaration by the Representatives
of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in General Congress assembled.

WHEN in the Course of human Events it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth the separate & equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation.

I'm pretty sure i read the first daft republished in a very old book and it said all men are equal (there would be no slavery) which was of course taken out.

Sorry if this has been asked and answered before, this is the first time I've written anything on Wikipedia.

Every time I try to use Wikipedia to look up something in the US Constitution, which is often, I'm annoyed by the format that makes it a bit difficult to just browse the whole document.  I'm not asking to delete anything.  I'm aware of the Wikisources version, which includes hyper-links and other extraneous text, and has the amendments separately including unratified parts of the Bill of Rights.  What I'd like to see, and I'm willing to assemble it myself if necessary, is all the text of the Constitution and active amendments, with no other text added, no hyperlinks, no commentary interspersed.  The text should be absolutely complete and accurate, IOW the "official" version, with all the original capitalizations, punctuations, etc.  I don't care so much about the typographic formatting; it could use different font sizes and bolding to make the document more readable, and use space and indenting to show section breaks, etc.  If people think it necessary to have some table of contents or index, it could be rendered on a separate page as links to the "clean" version.  I think this is unnecessary, as the current Wikipedia pages already do this.

Is there any reason this hasn't been done already?  Am I the only one who's interested in having the complete, accurate US Constitution on one page, without commentary and hyperlinks, suitable for printing?  I'm sure there are other web sources for this, but it's just strange and surprising for it to be missing from Wikipedia.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.161.89.182|69.161.89.182]] ([[User talk:69.161.89.182|talk]]) 15:08, 28 January 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== RE:Last sentences in introduction ==

I recently removed a sentence at the end of the introduction (''Research has shown that this influence may be on the wane, however.'') for bring un-encyclopedic and non-NPOV.  As a result, the last paragraph of the introduction reads:
{{quote|The Constitution is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]]. The Constitution of the United States was the first constitution of its kind, and has influenced the constitutions of other nations.}}

:As often, my own preference is for bare bones in an introduction, or in a master article that has several subordinate articles.

::Henderson's removal will take away the last bit in the introduction of the previous compact-of-sovereign states POV from two years ago, which misapplied Articles history to the Constitution in the fashion of the Lost Cause tradition and the writings of Jefferson Davis.

The very phrase "Articles Congress" is unfamiliar to most readers. Googling "Articles Congress" one concludes that the phrase has been excessively abbreviated (this isn't Twitter; you aren't limited to 140 characters) and should be written out more fully "Congress as organized under the Articles of Confederation." Further, the reference to a Supreme Court during the period of "first government" is very confusing. The relevant decisions were in fact made by the Supreme Court ''after'' the Constitution had come into force, but that is not at all obvious from the existing text. Someone unfamiliar with American history is going to be scratching their head for a long time over this. Finally, this section, though titled "First Government", says almost nothing about the first government of the US, before the Articles of Confederation had been enacted. If the rest of the Wikipedia article is this confused, it need to be reorganized along more logical lines.[[User:Floozybackloves|Floozybackloves]] ([[User talk:Floozybackloves|talk]]) 18:22, 22 August 2014 (UTC)

:Please do elaborate the constitutional elements of the Revolutionary Congress with additional sourced contributions. But the sentence with the phrase "Prior to the Articles of Confederation and ''the Articles Congress''," --- does not need to be rewritten "Prior to the Articles of Confederation and ''the Congress as organized under the Articles of Confederation''". That assumes the reader cannot follow an introductory prepositional phrase and it results in a stilted style of needless repetition. 

:When the Supreme Court is used as a reference in the narrative, as we use "historian John Smith", it is common to link cases, which are dated after the establishment of the Constitution. Problem solved. I agree compound sentences are sometimes difficult to follow for the elementary reader, though the general newspaper reader comprehends at a sixth grade reading level.

==Original Text section edit==
I have simplified the subheadings in the [[United States Constitution#Original text|Original Text]] section.  There is no need to have four and five levels of subheadings in this section.  I also tweaked the wording in the Articles 2, 5, and 7. The wording now follows the pattern in the other articles more closely.  In the final paragraph of the section I modified the wording to match the wording Congress uses RE:Amendments (''This amendment shall be inoperative unless ...'') I have also removed the sentence mentioned above by [[User:Arcanicus|Arcanicus]] as its point is made up-page in two places. [[User:Drdpw|Drdpw]] ([[User talk:Drdpw|talk]]) 23:39, 26 June 2014 (UTC)
:You have violated the word limit of 3-4 words for subheading titles. Perhaps eliminating calling out the number of each sequential article would help. 
:The insistence on stressing the nine rather than eleven, when nothing happened to constitute the new government until Congress certified that eleven states had ratified and disbanded itself, reflects the contention of Jefferson Davis, that the United States existed until there were only eight states left, implying states ability to secede was inherent in the Constitution. His position is wp:fringe Lost Cause historiography. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 11:54, 27 June 2014 (UTC)
:::I couldn't find a wiki-rule limiting size of subheading titles VH.  I did modify the headings used in the section a bit.  
:::I know nothing about Confederate lost cause historiography and, probably because I'm a Yankee, the point you were trying to make sailed past me.  The reason for stressing the number nine in the Article VII subsection is because that's the "magic number" referred to there.  That's as far ahead as the framers thought.  The stress is on the number eleven earlier in the article, and appropriately so, as that was the number of states that had ratified the Constitution when the Confederation Congress certified that the Constitution had been ratified by more than the number required by its terms for it to become operational and made it so.  Its not a matter of insisting on one over the other.  Its seeing each as being appropriate to stress at the appropriate point in the narrative.

== GF edit to introduction by MorrisS ==

While the current legal system of San Marino began in 1600 and is far older than that of the USA, it isn't correct to call the Leges Statuti of 1600 the Constitution of the Republic of San Marino, even though its Book One does contain constitutional elements. For an in depth discussion, see [[Talk:Constitution of San Marino]].  The consensus, RE: this article, was to refer to the United States Constitution as "the oldest constitution of its kind ..."

== "Frame of Government" ==

We have major sections entitled "Frame of Government", "Modifying the frame" and then "Amendments". Why not rename "Frame of Government" to "Original Text"? After all, the ''entire'' constitution is the frame of the government, so the current section title is misleading. The "Modifying the frame" section is just a long explanation of the amendment process and rationale. First off, this was already covered (in less detail) in the section covering Article Five. Second, shouldn't it just be part of the "Amendments" section? Third, there's so much detail here that you could almost spin it off into a new article. And even if we're going to keep the basic structure here, "Modifying the frame" should be renamed as "Amendment Process" or something, shouldn't it? As it stands, it sounds as if "the frame" is something distinct from "the Constitution". [[User:Sonicsuns|Sonicsuns]] ([[User talk:Sonicsuns|talk]]) 00:44, 1 August 2014 (UTC)
:{{reply to|Sonicsuns}}Thanks for your input.  I see your point and I've made some modifications to the article.  The ''Modifying the frame'' section has been split up, with parts going to the ''introduction'', ''Article Five'' subsection (replacing a couple sentences that looked like ''original research'' and said basically the same thing) or ''Adopted amendments'' section.  You'll note that I didn't change the ''Frame of government'' section title.  Now, without the ''Modifying the frame'' section, and with the introductory sentences beneath the title, is it clearer that "the frame" is not distinct from "the Constitution"?  [[User:Drdpw|Drdpw]] ([[User talk:Drdpw|talk]]) 19:52, 1 August 2014 (UTC)
::{{reply to|Drdpw}}Thanks for making those changes. I still think that "Frame of Government" should be retitled "Original Text", though. It still implies that the adopted amendments are not part of "the frame". Yet in actual practice, the First Amendment (for instance) is ''very'' important. You could easily describe the Bill of Rights, and indeed all the adopted amendments, as being part of "the frame" on which the government operates. "Frame of Government" is ambiguous, but "Original Text" is objectively true.[[User:Sonicsuns|Sonicsuns]] ([[User talk:Sonicsuns|talk]]) 21:36, 5 August 2014 (UTC)
:::Perhaps the title should be "Original frame". The United States government in its "Original frame" is organized as a central government in a federal system. It is a central government with three branches to protect against centralized tyranny, in a federal system with states to protect against state tyranny. The amendments are improvements on the frame, such as presidential elections specifying vice president, or removing corrupt state legislatures from electing U.S. Senators. 

:::The Bill of Rights was very important to secure the ratification of those fearful of the central government before the checks and balances at the federal level were well understood. Indeed they are still important, as much of the national jurisprudence of the Supreme Court over the last century and a half since the 14th Amendment is the work of conforming the states to the Bill of Rights which was initially only applied to the central government.

== Amendments enumeration ==

This effort continues the general effect in recent edits to eliminate historical context and encyclopedic style, replacing it with a restatement from other articles in an mechanically itemized fashion. This has the consequence of making the article impenetrable for the general reader. The effect is exaggerated with the proposed expansion of the list of amendments article then translated into this one. 

Simply restating the organization of the subsidiary articles violates one of Wikipedia’s principles, a prohibition against articles mirroring each other. Diverse content, organization and illustration across related articles is encouraged, but now that is to be lost, removing the value added by topically organizing the material with historical context, and replacing it with a mere descriptive listing.  

Instead, section 4. "Adopted amendments" should be subdivided into 4.1 “Bill of Rights” with three subdivisions topically organized: individual rights, trial and sentencing, and potential military coercion. 4.2 “Subsequent Amendments” with three subdivisions topically organized, citizen rights, three branches, and states and abuses. This makes the material more accessible for the general reader. 

{{ping|Drdpw}} The recent rewrite of the second amendment description per se by Drdpw may dodge some of the recent instability from POV edits. But it should be addressed topically along with the potential military coercion addressed in the third amendment.

:I had intended to stay out of this, since law and legal history are not among my major interests, but was asked very politely and with much flattery, so I'll throw in my two cents worth.  The article as a whole has expanded some 10% in the past two months, and the majority of the expansion is in the Amendments section.  As it happens, large articles often trigger my sense of [[WP:TOOBIG]], in part because of my two tablets and an old smartphone, none of which can read this whole article.  Many readers, though few highly active editors, have their only access to Wikipedia by similarly limited means.  So, here with my real computer, I look at article [[United States Bill of Rights]] which handles its particular topics rather thoroughly without saying much in its itemized list.  It would not suffer much if it where bigger (especially since it is a more advanced topic, thus less interesting to underequipped readers) whilst our present article would definitely benefit from being smaller.
:Notice, I have thus far ignored my old friend {{ping|TheVirginiaHistorian}}'s concern that handling the amendments thematically (he's one of the editors who did that, years ago) made it all easier for the reader to understand.  This too is an important consideration, as other articles, most of them linked from our text, handle each list item better and a serial summary of them is not needed here.

I would think it more satisfactory to have the Bill of Rights under one heading, with sub-headings or prefatory comments to sub-divide it further, if you must. Then the Civil War amendments, Prohibition amendments, etc. And you don't have to group them so severely. The XXII could be under one heading - Reaction to FDR's Four Terms, the XXV under another - Post Kennedy Assassination Presidential Succession Worries. Additionally, the amendment titles aren't bold enough. That could be improved by either making each amendment a sub-section, with the additional advantage of putting each in the table of contents, or rendering each ordinal-numbered title in boldface.

For example, in the present arrangement "Governmental authority" doesn't include the XIVth amendment, to which is often attributed the greatest expansion of Federal government authority; and, in your newly proposed arrangement, the XVIth, the federal income tax, is shoehorned into the congressional section, while the XXth, which relates to congressional terms as well, is put with the presidential amendments.

{{od}}
Making each Amendment its own list heading violates WP:MOS, and the purported purpose of the rewrite is to achieve a better rating. There is no internal rationale for mere chronological enumeration, that is what the listing at [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution]] does, and a link to that chronological listing should be included in this article in a hat note for the general reader. 

The XIVth relates to states, so it is reasonably placed in a section of perhaps five paragraphs related to “states and federalism”, along with IX, X, XV, XVIII-XXI. The XIVth is not related to expansion of federal authority so much as it is related to curbing the injustices of state abuses by individuals and minorities appealing to national judiciary against the state-based tyranny of a local majority. In the federal system there is dual state and national citizenship. The XIVth basically extends the protections of the Bill of Rights and due process to individuals as state citizens.

Taxation is a power of Congress, it is logically and organically included in a congressional section. “Shoehorned” implies forced. But placing congressional powers with three other congressionally related amendments is not forced, it is good organization. The implication in the post above that organizing an article about the U.S. Constitution is now in the current day incoherent if it addresses amendments about the Congress in a subsection on Congress is, well, untenable.  

The XXth would be included in both congressional and presidential sections because it addresses both. But if it is to be only one, it briefly determines the primacy of the First Branch organization, Congress, leaving congressional with four paragraphs and presidential with four.

===Drdpw proposal===
{{reply to|Dhtwiki}}Yes, if you're looking for a numerical 1, 2, 3, ... 25, 26, 27 ordering of amendments, the current thematic arrangement might indeed seem confusing.  That confusion should however, subside after a few moments as you consider why each particular amendment is in the group that it's in.

Regarding amendments 11&ndash;27,
*Governmental authority: 11 (authority of federal courts to hear cases against states), 16 (authority of Congress to impose/collect direct taxes), 18 (authority of Congress to regulate alcohol)& 21 (authority of states to regulate alcohol)
*Safeguards of civil rights: 13 (abolition of slavery), 14 (citizens' immunities, privilege and protections) , 15 (voting rights expansion), 19 (voting rights expansion), 23 (voting rights expansion), 24 (breaking down voter suppression)  & 26 (voting rights expansion)
*Government processes and procedures 12 (electoral college process reform), 17 (procedure for electing US senators changed), 20 (start date for Presidential, Vice Presidential and Congressional terms changed), 22 (rule established for how many terms/years a person can serve as President), 25 (procedures & process regarding presidential succession modified) & 27 (procedural change regarding Congressional pay increases)
I suppose XIII and XIV could go under "governmental authority", and the group containing XV, XIX, XXIII, XXIV & XXVI could be renamed "voting rights". [[User:Drdpw|Drdpw]] ([[User talk:Drdpw|talk]]) 05:24, 28 August 2014 (UTC)

:It took me a considerable amount of time to find my amendment (I think it was the 19th) in your scheme, but find it I did. However, that doesn't speak well of this arrangement being anything but unintuitive to the uninitiated. Is there any other U.S. constitutional presentation that starts out this way? Have you had much feedback from other novitiates on this matter? As far as re-arranging, I think all your arrangements so far are too arbitrary and unintuitive; and I wouldn't break up the Civil War set by putting 13 and 14 apart from 15.

::Some categorization is necessary to make the article more accessible specially on different browsers, as noted by Jim.henderson. I prefer the organic organization of the original document reflecting Montesquieu and the Federalist Papers, Drdpw is looking at a more political science formulation. Dhtwiki seems to prefer chronological organization based on historical period themes. But finding the 19th Amendment in Drdpw's scheme is relatively easy under the category "voting rights" he considered in his last posting.

::{{ping|Drdpw}} So to put the pieces together, Drdpw proposal might be amended to consolidate 9 and 10 into Government authority, and move 13 into a new citizenship and voting category, to get, 
:* Individual liberty. 1, 2, 3
:* Legal protections. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
:* Citizenship and voting. 13, 15, 19, 23, 24, 26. 
:* Government authority. 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21
:* Government procedure. 12, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27 
::Is that attainable? It should yield five sections of about equal length.

:::As I've mentioned before, it would be helpful if each amendment had its own subsection, within your topical arrangement, with a heading consisting of amendment number, date ratified, and short descriptive subtitle. So...

::*XIXth Amendment (1920) - Gives women the right to vote

:::::Yes, that's about it, except that each article or amendment should have a terse description appended (Art. I - Establishes the legislative branch, Amend.

The point is taken about the table of contents becoming lengthy, especially as it is now fairly balanced with the infobox's length (I don't suppose there's a way to make the TOC multi-columnar).

What does "blackout of boldface" mean? The proposed sub-headings are boldfaced to simulate how they'd look as subheadings. Boldface would not be used in actuality. And where does it say that it's bad encyclopedic style to have extra sub-headings, which don't really mirror anything, since nowhere else would there be the succinct characterizations of the amendments? However, to keep the table of contents from being grotesquely lengthened, I propose that merely the amendment numbers be included in the current topical sub-headings. So, you would have...
*'''Safeguards of liberty (I, II, III)'''
...or, somewhat different stylistically...
*'''Citizenship and voting: amendments 13, 15, 19, 23, 24, 26'''

::That looks more reasonable...I would argue for it. The links individual amendment names are to show in blue as The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], that is sufficient highlighting. Perhaps to distinguish the Articles from the Amendments, the subtopics can be styled,
 
::'''Individual Liberty (Amendments I, II, III)''' 

::''The first three amendments safeguard individual liberties. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (1791) prohibits Congress from obstructing the exercise of certain individual freedoms: [[Freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[freedom of petition]]...'' 

::''The [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] (1791)  protects the right of individuals[n] to [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|keep and bear arms]]...''

::''The [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]] (1791) prohibits the federal government from forcing individuals to provide lodging to soldiers in their homes during peacetime without their consent...'' 

::'''Legal protections (Amendments IV, V, VI, VII, VIII)''' 

::''The amendments 4-8 offer legal protections by the federal judicial system. The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] (1791) protects people against unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]] of either self or [[property]] by government officials....'' 

::I also concur with '''Safeguards of Liberty (1, 2, 3)''' as a subsection header style showing up in the table of contents.

<!-- Begin request -->
I recently viewed at least 5 accounts of Religious notations, God and "In God We Trust" being stated on this Factual account of the United States Constitution as true and factual accounts and quotes from the founding fathers who wrote and signed it. Those have all been removed, might I ask why? It is not opinion, when stating fact, why remove it? I would like to see the facts put back in place about the fact that our country was founded Under God by a bunch of Christians. I do not want this due to any other reason than to keep the facts in place. I do not subscribe to any one religion, but facts are facts and should remain in place for historical factual accounting. I have collected data and facts from Presidential quotes available at .gov and other reputable websites and would like some of them placed on this page since they are facts and accounts of this time, when the constitution was signed, plus continuing accounts of stating God as a part of Government belief. What are your requirements to include these facts? I would like to request a section be placed on this page to answer all queries from people now-a-days who do not have the facts straight about how the USA was founded by Christians and God fearing men. Here are some quotes that I feel should be placed in the section "Religious Men who were a part of developing and signing the constitution as well as other quotes about God and Religion by politicians in the USA".

Below are some of the thousands of quotes endorsing God in government by our Founding Fathers and others in American history. American children have prayed and read the Holy Bible in schools for 355 years (1607 – 1962), Congress recommended Bibles for America and funded Christian missionaries, the third verse of our national anthem says, “And this be our motto, ‘In God is our trust”.

In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government ought to be instructed … No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.
- Noah Webster, Preface Noah Webster Dictionary, 1828

Joseph Story – Supreme Court Justice

“I verily believe Christianity necessary to the support of civil society. One of the beautiful boasts of our municipal jurisprudence is that Christianity is a part of the Common Law … There never has been a period in which the Common Law did not recognize Christianity as lying its foundations.”

Original Harvard University Student Handbook 1636

Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well: the main end of his life and studies is “to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life” (John 17.3), and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom, as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning. And seeing the Lord only giveth wisdom, let everyone seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seek it of Him (Prov. 2.3).

William McGuffy – author of McGuffy Reader, which was used for over 100 years in American schools as the primary textbook

The Christian religion is the religion of our country. From it are derived our nation, on the character of God, on the great moral Governor of the universe. On its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our free Institutions. From no source has this author drawn more conspicuously than from the sacred Scriptures. From all these extracts from the Bible, I make no apology.

Congress – First Prayer in Congress

O LORD, OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, high and mighty King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who dost from Thy throne behold all the dwellers on earth, and reignest with power supreme and uncontrolled over all the kingdoms, empires and governments; look down in mercy we beseech Thee, on these American States, who have fled to Thee from the rod of the oppressor, and thrown themselves on Thy gracious protection, desiring henceforth to be dependent only on Thee; to Thee they have appealed for the righteousness of their cause; to Thee do they now look up for that countenance and support which Thou alone canst give; take them, therefore, Heavenly Father, under Thy nurturing care; give them wisdom in council and valor in the field; defeat the malicious design of our cruel adversaries; convince them of the unrighteousness of their cause; and if they persist in their sanguinary purpose, O let the voice of Thy own unerring justice, sounding in their hearts, constrain them to drop the weapons of war from their unnerved hands in the day of battle! Be Thou present, O God of wisdom, and direct the counsels of this honorable assembly; enable them to settle things on the best and surest foundation, that the scene of blood may be speedily closed, that order, harmony and peace may be effectually restored, and truth and justice, religion and piety prevail and flourish among Thy people. Preserve the health of their bodies and vigor of their minds; shower down on them, and the millions they here represent, such temporal blessings as Thou seest expedient for them in this world, and crown them with everlasting glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Our Savior. Amen.

Calvin Coolidge- President of the United States of America

“The foundations of our society and our government rest so much on the teachings of the Bible that it would be difficult to support them if faith in these teachings would cease to be practically universal in our country.”
- Calvin Coolidge

Harry S. Truman – President of the United States of America

“The fundamental basis of this Nation’s law was given to Moses on the Mount. The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings which we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul.”
- Harry S. Truman

“This Nation was established by men who believed in God. … You will see the evidence of this deep religious faith on every hand.’
- Harry S. Truman

Dwight D. Eisenhower – President of the United States of America

“Without God there could be no American form of government, nor an American way of life. Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first, the most basic, expression of Americanism. Thus, the founding fathers of America saw it, and thus with God’s help, it will continue to be.”
- Dwight D. Eisenhower

“I believe that the next half century will determine if we will advance the cause of Christian civilization or revert to the horrors of brutal paganism.”
- Theodore Roosevelt, President

“This is a Christian nation.”
- Harry Truman, President

“[The United States is] founded on the principles of Christianity”
- Franklin D. Roosevelt, President

Ronald Reagan – President of the United States of America

Of the many influences that have shaped the United States into a distinctive nation and people, none may be said to be more fundamental and enduring than the Bible.
- Ronald Reagan

Deep religious beliefs stemming from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible inspired many of the early settlers of our country, providing them with the strength, character, convictions, and faith necessary to withstand great hardship and danger in this new and rugged land. These shared beliefs helped forge a sense of common purpose among the widely dispersed colonies — a sense of community which laid the foundation for the spirit of nationhood that was to develop in later decades.
- Ronald Reagan

The Bible and its teachings helped form the basis for the Founding Fathers’ abiding belief in the inalienable rights of the individual, rights which they found implicit in the Bible’s teachings of the inherent worth and dignity of each individual. This same sense of man patterned the convictions of those who framed the English system of law inherited by our own Nation, as well as the ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
- Ronald Reagan

For centuries the Bible’s emphasis on compassion and love for our neighbor has inspired institutional and governmental expressions of benevolent outreach such as private charity, the establishment of schools and hospitals, and the abolition of slavery.
- Ronald Reagan

“The Congress of the United States, in recognition of the unique contribution of the Bible in shaping the history and character of this Nation, and so many of its citizens, has by Senate Joint Resolution 165 authorized and requested the President to designate the year 1983 as the ‘Year of the Bible.’”‘
- Ronald Reagan

Inside the Bible’s pages lie the answers to all the problems that mankind has ever known. I hope Americans will read and study the Bible.
- Ronald Reagan

Is any of this addition possible for the facts to be confirmed that some politicians in history of the Constitution and USA political parties were and still are Christians.

::The founding fathers certainly agreed that the tenets held in common by the Christian sects were the foundation of the personal virtue in society required for a successful large-scale republic. And the church structures which allowed a “priesthood of all believers” to actively participate in governance in the Calvinist traditions was certainly important in the structures of governance instituted at the founding. 

::Appeals to those sensibilities at the founding were requisite to persuade majorities to get anything done among the democratic branches of government. If it is the case as John Adams said, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity.”, it is also true that members of all religions prosper here under a tolerant regime, allowing for each, their contributions of wisdom and virtue in the civil sphere.

::It is not that faith is of no importance, it is that here it is of such great importance that no man or creation of man can be allowed to interfere with individual conscience and its individual relationship with the Creator. In the modern day, that is often translated as removing any reference to any contemplated form of superior being outside the self. But it need not be so, especially in the [[History of the United States Constitution]] article, where it may be more appropriate to explore the belief and character of the founders.

:Agreed. Without changing the sense, I copy edited for conciseness, leaving all links and references in tact. The attempt is as follows:

:''Since the Constitution came into force in 1789, it has been amended twenty-seven times.[2] In general, the first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights protect individual liberty and justice, and safeguard a balance between the federal government, states and the people within. The majority of the seventeen later amendments expand individual civil rights. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures. Amendments to the US Constitution, unlike ones made to many constitutions world-wide, are appended to the end of the document. At seven articles and twenty-seven amendments, it is the shortest written constitution in force.[3]''

::''...and safeguard <span style="color: green">the political power sharing arrangement</span> between the federal government, states and the people within.''

== Influence of Iroquois Great Law of Peace ==

The discussion in the section [[United_States_Constitution#Native_Americans|United States Constitution: Influences: Native Americans]] regarding the relative influence of the Iroquois Great Law of Peace seems rather incomplete; it also contradicts the information given elsewhere in [[Great_Law_of_Peace#Influence_on_the_United_States_Constitution|Great Law of Peace: Influence on the United States Constitution]], and I've tagged it as such. Basically, this article treats the influence of the Iroquois Confederacy as a given, while the latter article treats this as a controversial hypothesis. I tend to think the later is likely the case, and that both sides of this argument should be given here, and that the respective sections in both articles should be brought more in line with one another. [[User:Iamcuriousblue|Iamcuriousblue]] ([[User talk:Iamcuriousblue|talk]]) 20:24, 25 April 2015 (UTC)

:Yes, it's in need of fixing. No, it doesn't need more information in this already long article. Rather, less. This material should be cut to one or two sentences, lose its header, move to the top of the parent section, and be joined there by similarly brief mentions of other confederacies well known and more often discussed by colonial gentlemen of the time such as [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and the ancient [[Achaean League]].

::Agree. The existing verbiage could be blue lined to the following passage about quarter the size without changing the effect. 

:::''The Iroquois nations' political confederacy and democratic government under the Great Law of Peace have been credited as influences on the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.[25] While John Rutledge (SC) quoted Iroquoian law to the Constitutional Convention, [28  the Iroquois experience with confederacy was both a model and a cautionary tale. Their "Grand Council" had no coercive control over the constituent members, and decentralization of authority and power frequently plagued the Six Nations.[29]''

=="the executive, consisting of the President"==
Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure the executive branch consists of more entities than just the President. [[Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution|Article Two]] does say that "the executive power shall be vested in a President", but that's still quite different from ''consisting of''. I'd propose changing the phrasing to "headed by". [[Special:Contributions/2A02:1810:4D34:DC00:C421:D27F:537:E61E|2A02:1810:4D34:DC00:C421:D27F:537:E61E]] ([[User talk:2A02:1810:4D34:DC00:C421:D27F:537:E61E|talk]]) 19:25, 3 May 2015 (UTC)

:Constitutionally the president is the executive branch, but I think the wording could be changed a bit, to be less repetitive, as "consisting" gets a workout and may not be the best choice where the power is vested in a single person, or just to contrast with those branches where the power is vested jointly.

== Preamble regarding Welfare ==

There is no provision in the preamble providing for any form of welfare.  The explicit purpose, as written, was to promote the general welfare, which is quite a different matter.  "Provide for" would establish a duty to ensure every person's basic needs were met.  Promote requires a reduced duty of advocating processes that could potentially enhance the welfare of an individual or group.  There was never any intention by the authors of the document that the government should bankrupt the treasury to feed, cloth and house the masses.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.223.246.3|66.223.246.3]] ([[User talk:66.223.246.3|talk]]) 00:20, 5 May 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

<!-- Begin request -->

Please excise from the Preamble heading the paragraphs I've reproduced below, in which the text of the Preamble is dissected, needlessly, and made subject to a myriad of specious editorial claims that are not and will never be substantiable, no matter how many sources one tacks on after the period. The text of the Constitution is the text of the Constitution. To assume that "a more perfect union" refers back to the government under the Articles of Confederation is to take a liberty that the context doesn't allow. The phrase may be referencing England or France or the Ottoman Empire. It may be an expression of the founder's desire to create a union more perfect than all the unions that have come before and all the unions that have yet to come. Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't explain what exactly it means by "a more perfect union" and as a result neither can we. In addition to being groundless, the analysis is riddled with nonsense terms, such as "the powers of the earth," "social contract of democratic philosophy," and "things of a general welfare." The final sentence of the second paragraph is plainly incoherent. 

Ultimately, my request is that the paragraphs at issue be deleted and replaced with the text of the Preamble verbatim.

---"One people" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, "to form a more perfect Union" than had previously existed in the "perpetual Union" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to "secure the blessings of liberty", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, "our posterity".[27]

It is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy. It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people. The people are to be provided justice, civil peace, common defense, those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves, and freedom. A government of "liberty and union, now and forever", unfolds when "We" begin and establish this Constitution. ----

== Sixteenth Amendment ==

The Brushaber, 240 U.S. 1 (1916), case clearly identifies that the sixteenth amendment did not create any new taxing powers at page 11

"We are of opinion, however, [240 U.S. 1, 11] that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulation of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes."

and at page 12

"This result, instead of simplifying the situation and making clear the limitations on the taxing power, which obviously the Amendment must have been intended to accomplish, would create radical and destructive changes in our constitutional system and multiply confusion."

and at page 19

"Indeed, from another point of view, the Amendment demonstrates that no such purpose was intended, and on the contrary shows that it was drawn with the object of maintaining the limitations of the Constitution and harmonizing their operation."

The Brushaber case was written to attack the many averments to the law. The Brushaber case is not easy to follow but upon reading the above sections, no new taxing authority was created by the sixteenth amendment and the Constitution for the United States of America was not changed as the sixteenth amendment dose not identify the section or clauses that were changed where page 19 of Brushaber says "...the object of maintaining the limitations of the Constitution and harmonizing their operation".  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/198.8.5.43|198.8.5.43]] ([[User talk:198.8.5.43|talk]]) 22:46, 19 October 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

In the Ratification section, there is "In every state, the Federalists proved to be more united, and only they coordinated action among different states; the Anti-Federalists were localized and did not attempt to reach out to other states.[citation needed]" This is unlikely to be found, since both Rhode Island and North Carolina had Anti-Federalsist who successfully opposed ratification until a Bill of Rights.

== Now 6 yrs later, can we add "Closing endorsements" under "Original frame"? ==

Six years ago, the section in the main article that today is labeled "Original frame" was labeled "Articles". So, in "Talk", I requested that we rename the "Articles" section, because by labeling this overview section "Articles", we then excluded a subsection for the preamble (because it wasn't an Article) and we also excluded a subsection on the closing endorsements (because they weren't an Article). Yet logically, both should be presented in this overview section. So the "Articles" section was renamed to "Original frame", and the Preamble was then added there. But now, I am asking (because I'd rather not make such a big edit myself) for a concluding subsection to be added under "Original frame", which would be labeled perhaps "Closing endorsements", to address the "done in Convention..." section of the Constitution.

And just as a reminder, here's what I wrote here in "Talk" back in 2010:
:The preamble is not an article, so the current title has appeal, but it's incorrect. And that error leads the editors to omit a part of the Constitution itself (since it's not an Article per se). The part incorrectly omitted by this article is the dating sentence, which on the original is in large script similar to that which titles the Articles, and is therefore nothing like the textual corrections which appear to its left. These improvements and additions are recommended (but I'm too new to this to make these changes myself on such an important article, so instead of putting this in the article, I'm just making this recommendation):

I understand. Basically (I am Nundayowanno-Seneca), I heard from our elders that a basic form of tribalism was incorporated by the founding fathers in that 'building of physical peace (reconciliation)' can form dialect with 'keeping of the good word (communication)' where above all, values, equity, justice, power, etc, form the 'Tribunal.' I also know that almost every single (probably every) nation on Earth has a time when hunters stopped gathering and started keeping grains and building. After reading Paul Mason's 'Post-Capitalism,' it is very important to note that the ''tributary'' of these sort of notions or concepts can seep into almost every faucet of philosophy, i.e. a) Rosa Luxembourg's concept of economics in that 'building of colonies' allows bearing and 'keeping of military' allows state to both influence transportation of energy (physics).

== "The first constitution of its kind" ==

I think the phrasing "The first constitution of its kind" should be more clear. There are the [[Constitution of San Marino]], dated october 8, 1600 and the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755, both predating it and unmentioned (if not - unbeknown to them or not -  nationalistically ignored by most US sources). Plus, saying "of its kind" seems at best evasive language. Now I am not an expert of the US constitution, or the US in general, but is it possible to fix this unfortunate wording?--[[User:Nickanc|Nickanc]] ([[User talk:Nickanc|talk]]) 16:50, 3 May 2017 (UTC)
:Were both of those adopted by "the people's representatives"? Or by a single ruler, a body of nobles, or some other group? Though I think the connection should be clearer (my first reaction was to ask, "First constitution of ''what'' kind?"), I think that's the intended claim, that it was the first constitution adopted by "the people's representatives". [[User:Largoplazo|Largoplazo]] ([[User talk:Largoplazo|talk]]) 19:31, 3 May 2017 (UTC)
::Almost all republics claim to some extent to represent their people, but intending representatives as an elected body by all males over a certain age, San Marino does not qualify because between 1571 and 1906 the [[Grand and General Council]] members were chosen by [[co-option]] with some degree of freedom for the direct democratic assembly, called Arengo, so no election. However Corsica seems to qualify, the constitution was apparently adopted by a provisional assembly of the people's representives called ''Consulta generale di Corte'' (see [[:fr:Constitution corse]]).--[[User:Nickanc|Nickanc]] ([[User talk:Nickanc|talk]]) 08:24, 4 May 2017 (UTC)
::Could we perhaps say "the oldest constitution adopted by the people's representatives still in force and the second in history after the corsican constitution" (not sure Corsica is that relevant to be mentioned in the opening paragraph, but listing it prevents reverting it to "the frist constitution in history" which frankly is false)?--[[User:Nickanc|Nickanc]] ([[User talk:Nickanc|talk]]) 08:31, 4 May 2017 (UTC)
:::We solve that problem with "the first constitution of its kind" with better usage and style. It is not false, but true, backed by reliable sources.

Its sort of like the proposition that all of western civilization is of Greek derivation, as parodied in the movie, My Great Big Fat Greek Wedding. 
:::Scholars point to the widespread literacy in the United States and the ratification process as reported in the widely available press and discussed among the people as being a "first of its kind".

The [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 was drafted by politician [[Pasquale Paoli]] (1725-1807), based on Enlightenment ideals. It was ratified by the Corsican population and declared the short-lived [[Corsican Republic]] (1755-1769) to be a representative democracy. "A national parliament, or Diet, was composed of delegates elected from each district for three-year terms. Suffrage was extended to all men over the age of 25. Traditionally, women had always voted in village elections for podestà i.e. village elders, and other local officials, and it has been claimed that they also voted in national elections under the Republic."

The Corsican example apparently served as an inspiration for some American colonists. The [[Hearts of Oak (New York militia)|Hearts of Oak]] militia in the [[Province of New York]] called themselves "the Corsicans" when formed in 1775. Members included minor American politicians and soldiers, such as [[Nicholas Fish]], [[Robert Troup]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. 

Based on the article on Pasquale Paoli, he was seen as a hero in the United States. Despite the man using catchphrases such as "Either we shall be free or we shall be nothing" and "Either we shall win or we shall die (against the French), weapons in hand"

"The American [[Sons of Liberty]] movement were inspired by Paoli. [[Ebenezer Mackintosh|Ebenezer McIntosh]], a leader of the Sons of Liberty, named his son Paschal Paoli McIntosh in honor of him. In 1768, the editor of the ''[[New York Journal]]'' described Paoli as "''the greatest man on earth''". Several places in the [[United States]] are named after him. These include:
*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania]], which was named after "General Paoli's Tavern" a meeting-point of the [[Sons of Liberty]] and homage to the "General of the Corsicans".
*[[Paoli, Indiana]]
*[[Paoli, Wisconsin]]
*[[Paoli, Oklahoma]]
*[[Paoli, Colorado]]"

We have sources across several articles. What I don't get is why Americans were inspired by a revolutionary politician who spend his life trying to create a free Corsican state, struggling against the perceived tyranny of the [[Republic of Genoa]] and the [[Kingdom of France]]. Paoli famously failed to accomplish his goal, and (despite irridentist attempts) Corsica never did regain its independence. [[User:Dimadick|Dimadick]] ([[User talk:Dimadick|talk]]) 14:33, 7 May 2017 (UTC)

:This is great! Perhaps we should have it in this article that the U.S. Constitution is the "first permanent constitution of its kind", with a footnote to explain the Corsican Constitution and links to the Paoli article. 

:I find this unheralded factoid absolutely delightful. We just need a reliable scholarly source that also makes the connection that seems so obvious on the face of it. I have always been intrigued by the Mediterranean influences in American war making including the Civil War Zouaves and the U.S. Marine Corps officer's [[Mameluke sword]].

:The Americans who were inspired by Paoli were probably Enlightenment readers of Locke, Sidney and Milton or at least of their popularizers in the colonial press. That is of course complete speculative WP:OR on my part without sourcing the connection. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 14:41, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
::I agree on saying "first permanent" with a footnote. As for sources: the britannica article on [[Pasquale Paoli]] essentially covers most of what Dimadick said ( [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pasquale-Paoli britannica]), and for a source specifically on the connection there is [http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/html/v30/v30n3p117.html this article] by the president of a Pasquale Paoli foundation in Corsica. This [https://allthingsliberty.com/2016/05/paoli-hero-of-the-sons-of-liberty/ very sourced article] could be cited too, albeit centered on Paoli, not specifically on the connection Paoli-American Constitution. Following its footnotes it seems that as early as 1769 Paoli was very popular and the [[Pennsylvania Gazzette]] praised him to the point they wrote "that Mr. Wilkes in England; Dr. Lucas in Ireland; and Paschal Paoli in Corsica, are the three greatest Patriots in their respective Countries". Concerning French revolution, where sources are easier to find, Paoli's contribute and example was in person and very notorious, whereas for American history, he did not took part directly, but was regarded as an important source and example for the American revolution - also on the grounds that there were not many universal suffrage polities at the time - and was inspirational in some aspects more than in France, because American revolution was an independence war too, as Corsican. So not only Corsican Constitution precedes Amercan one, but inspired the American revolutionary movement. A link between actual articles of the two constitutions is perhaps possible, but I have not found anything on the matter. My guess would be that it could be extremely difficult to establish whether some statements are drawn from the Corsican constitution or directly from Enlightenment philosophy in general, but a general acknowledgement of the two movements is definitely established.--[[User:Nickanc|Nickanc]] ([[User talk:Nickanc|talk]]) 17:16, 19 May 2017 (UTC)

The wikipedia on the us constitution currently reads:

In general, the first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government.[4][5] The majority of the seventeen later amendments expand individual civil rights protections.

+++++++

This language presents 'liberty and justice' as occurrences opposed to 'individual civil rights protections'. In practice in the US, the segregation of these concepts has amounted to slavery.

::From the U.S. Senate perspective, the "profound difference" between the 18th and 19th centuries to the 20th century is that

:::b) in the late 20th century, with the Supreme Court's application of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] "due process" clause, '''the electorate in U.S. Senate elections expanded''' because that took the protections of the Bill of Rights applied to the U.S. government and constitutionally extended them to protect U.S. citizens from abuses by their state government. See state constitutions requiring two-state-representatives per each county and city, yielding a 20:1 population represented disparity (and greater) for city-county districts in state legislatures, and equal numbers of counties for Congressional districts regardless of population before the Supreme Court "one-man-one-vote" ruling at [[Baker v.

::It is true that there are conservatives who would restore state legislature election of U.S. Senators. It may be possible if the trust of the American people is restored in the State Legislatures when there are thirty uninterrupted years of ethical Congressional and state house redistricting comparable to the thirty years of Gilded Age corruption preceding the 17th Amendment. Then again, perhaps it will not be possible by good faith persuasion any time soon, as long as U.S. history is a required course in high school education, and modern state legislatures and judiciaries continue to underperform Congress and the Supreme Court. 
::It is true that there are conservatives who would restore state legislature independence of "due process" guarantees for state citizens so as to re-enact Jim Crow suffrage restrictions on 90% of citizens-of-color and Progressive suffrage restrictions on 50% of the lesser educated whites. It may be possible if gerrymandering of Congressional districts is not federally outlawed under Article I, Section 4 legislative powers upheld against gerrymandering at the Supreme Court's ''Viet V. Jubelirer'' 2004, and if U.S. Senators campaigning finance is substantial in the future from Russians (see Donald Trump 2016 campaign trend expanding), or China (see Jeb Bush 2016 campaign trend expanding). Perhaps not (see recent House bill on elections ethics and regulations sent to the Senate). 
::But the lede of this Wikipedia article should not be a partisan trumpeting of an aspiring new state's rights era dominated by foreigners as it was by foreign financial interests during the Gilded Age (see [your objectionable "Progressive"] Teddy Roosevelt and "Trust Busting" majority British-owned trusts and railroads, but only "jaw-boning" majority U.S. citizen-owned consortiums). 
::Here, instead, the article lede should reflect the article topic, "United States Constitution" at the present time, for the general reader. [[User:TheVirginiaHistorian|TheVirginiaHistorian]] ([[User talk:TheVirginiaHistorian|talk]]) 16:22, 12 March 2019 (UTC)
