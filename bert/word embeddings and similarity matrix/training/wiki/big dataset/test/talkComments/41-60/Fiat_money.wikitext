== Etymology of the term "fiat" and "fiat money" is broken, which is corrupting the rest ==

The Latin is mentioned as an after thought in the head, but in ancient Rome, all laws were established by fiat (not just laws regarding money). The true meaning of the word "fiat" is synonymous with "Act" as in "an Act of Congress."

In ancient Rome (where the Latin originates), the unofficial money first took the form of the [[aes rude]] (rough bronze) -- this was a heavy weight of unmeasured bronze -- then Rome passed a law, and by fiat (official decree) created the [[aes signatum]] (signed bronze) which was a 5lb bar of bronze stamped with the official seal of Rome certifying that it was of a certain weight of bronze. The first fiat currency of Rome was, in fact, metal and had an intrinsic value.

In light of these facts, this first sentence in the head should be changed from this:

* Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation.

To this:

* Fiat money is any money that has been established as the official money of a Nation or State by the laws of the Nation or State.

Further, the rest of the article should be edited to preserve this true meaning.

It is a gross error to presume that simply because some Nations in history have used law to make worthless things their official money that all official money is worthless. This error not only taints this entire article, but many text books written by experts as well. None the less, the facts remain the facts and this article should correct the error, not perpetuate it.
 
These 2 terms are synonymous: "fiat money" & "official money".

US Gold and silver Coins were established by Constitutional fiat and further by the fiat of Congress as official money.

== Criminal activity ==

==several problems here==
Andrew Jacksons destruction of the "Bank of the United States", was not -at all- a declaration that government backed currency was illegal -you may have been deceived by the name of the bank, as many are. The "Bank of the United States" was actually a privately owned bank which, through fractional reserve banking, was sucking the lifeblood out of the economy -then and today through the falsely named "federal reserve bank" and banking in general (again via fractional reserve banking).

What most people fail to realize when contemplating banking is that banks aren't earning 5-10% interest based on their loans, they earn vastly more than this (in an expanding economy) because the fractional reserve system allows them to issue 10 times what they hold in reserves, functionally allowing them to 'earn' 50-100% on reserves. As most 'money' in the economy comes through bank loans and as repayment of interest is often far more than the principal, banks functional drain money from the economy UNLESS the economy is growing INFINITELY (and subsequently destructively consuming the FINITE resources of the planet).  This means that with fractional reserve banking, FIAT money can never be functional unless the economy is self-destructive i.e. a pyramid/ponzi scheme.

Further, the US dollar, while not backed by metal gold, is backed via the saudi bourse, by black gold. This is the reason why the US economy can maintain such high trade deficits, as so many of the US trade partners must buy their oil with US dollars.
i.e. if they revalued their currency against the US dollar, the price of oil would naturally go much higher and they'd have to pay far more while simultaneouly losing business as the deficits rebalanced.

:You neglect to consider the liabilities of banks (ie deposits) which multiply under fractional reserve banking and return the bulk of the income to broader society. Banks manage credit not money. Every business has limited cash reserves. 
:[[User:Terjepetersen|Terjepetersen]] 20:54, 28 February 2006 (UTC)----

Your arguement needs more detail, I do not know what your point is. It seems as though you disagree with my statement above, but you do not lay out specifics. The liabilities of the bank is primarily the deposits, the deposits make up the bulk of the reserve. The bank pays interest on that reserve (and that reserve alone). The bank, however, loans out, around 10 times the reserve (fractional reserve banking) and earns interest on every bit of it. Hence, at 5-10% interest, they earn 50-100% interest, yet they only pay back interest -to their depositors an amount approximate to 5-10% again.  This is why banks often have the largest buildings in town. Further, as the total sum of principle plus interest is more than the principle lent out initially, and as most of the money in an economy comes from bank loans, the economy can only exist if it grows at an ever accelerating pace (more loans going out than being paid in at any one time), as otherwise the banks would suck up every last dollar in the economy and the economy would collapse (this is soon to happen as growth is about to peak on this planet (finite resources).  If you have a specific argument, please email me directly and we can discuss it.

:: Your statement "as the total sum of principle plus interest is more than the principle lent out initially, and as most of the money in an economy comes from bank loans, the economy can only exist if it grows at an ever accelerating pace" doesn't really stand up to scrutiny, you are assuming the interest paid on the loan is shuttled out of the economy for good, however you're forgetting that the profits banks make (including the central banks) are ultimately paid back to the shareholders of the banks, and hence that money goes straight back into the wider economy. Take the Bank of England, each year it has to pay it profits on issuance to HMRC, that money goes into the consolidated fund, so it can be spent on public services (paying wages for teachers, police etc...), so it becomes the income of those who work for the govt, or they may be used to allow everyone else to pay less in tax. You could very well argue that in the US the FED is privately owned, I don't really know who it pays its profits to and you may very well argue that if that money goes to private corporations then maybe the FED should be nationalized, but that's a different story. Since the long term trend for the economy is to grow, and since Bank of England notes haven't been payable in gold for something like 80 years, and yet current GDP is several times larger than it was in the 1930s, your argument doesn't stand up to empirical evidence.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ivanleo|Ivanleo]] ([[User talk:Ivanleo|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ivanleo|contribs]]) 22:04, 6 May 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The amount of wrong in your argument is incredible.  First of all banks earn nothing on reserves, reserves are a percentage (I believe its around 10 or so percent) of demand deposits that banks must keep as cash in the Federal Reserve.  Mean while they can lend out the rest of what they take in (the remaining 90 or so percent of demand deposits, and everything they take in as savings deposits and certificates of deposit).  The bank doesn't magically make more money, basically savers lend money to the bank who then lends it to loan applicants.  If the bank lends more then it has and accidentally dips into its reserves, then it must borrow money from other banks or the Federal Reserve, or face being closed down by the Fed during the Fed's nightly audit of the bank.

::Fiat money does actually exist its what just about every major currency in the world is now a days, the thought that US currency is backed by Saudi oil is absurd, if you must think of it being backed by anything its backs by the US GDP and its Government.  The US, and all countries that buy oil from Saudi Arabia, don't buy it in US dollars, its bought in Saudi Riyals, though it may appear to be bought in other currency other then that since the comparative values of every countries currency is well know and exchanging currency is an incredibly simple task.

::And to answer your third point, that "i.e. if they revalued their currency against the US dollar, the price of oil would naturally go much higher and they'd have to pay far more while simultaneouly(sic) losing business as the deficits rebalanced."  thats pretty wrong too, the reason why other countries don't revalue themselves against the dollar is simple, they have a lot of US dollars, and if they revalue those US dollars that they have in their vaults will be survey says... worth less then they were before.  In cases like China who have a whole mess of US dollars, a revaluing would mean a big loss for them.  There are other factors too, the US is the worlds largest importer, if a country revalues and says now our money is worth twice as much as the dollar, the dollar buys less, the US shops elsewhere.

::With regard to the fundamentals of banking, I suggest you read "Modern Money Mechanics" (it's floating about the web as a PDF, just google it) published by the Chicago branch of the FED. They clearly state how the fractional reserve system works and make it clear that banks do in fact create tradable electronic units (you can call it money like I do, or call it credit, or whatever you want). As that money is created it is redeposited in banks and is then used as the basis for another round of monetary expansion. New debts are based on old debts, hence the entire money supply is built as an inverted pyramid. The limits are (as you pointed out) the ten to one ratio (or thereabouts) of loans to reserves and the requirements laid down by BASEL I & II regulations. BASEL II came into effect at the end of 2008 and effectively shut down the loan engine of banks around the globe, triggering the global recession.

::The US dollar IS backed by the price of oil. Your view that the other countries of the world buy oil in Riyals is absurd on the face of it. It immediately implies that the middle east is the wealthiest nation on earth and not the US nor Europe. In fact, the major bourse's in the middle east effectively sell oil in US dollars (primarily) and have only recently added the Euro. The Riyals has mostly been pegged to the US dollar and most every country pays in these two currencies. Thus the US and the eurozone have gotten a free-ride as other countries use dollars and now euros to buy oil. Hence they keep their currencies low against the dollar in order to be able to sell junk to american consumers. Now that the FED is monetizing it's debt, the price of oil will go up as the value of the dollar depreciates and the Riyal is being allowed, more and more, to float.

== Fiat money is legally convertible to any other currency - about 155 of them. ==

All fiat money is created out of nothing: out of thin air. It is, however, backed by all - the sum total of - the underlying value systems in an economy, namely sound governance, sound economic policies, sound monetary policies, sound industrial policies, sound commercial policies, etc. Annual inflation above the central bank´s inflation target indicates the excess of fiat money created in the banking system.

It is misleading to state that fiat money is not legally convertible to any other thing. Fiat money is used every day by 6 billion people to buy anything and everything in an economy. Fiat money has real value. All monetary units in the world are fiat money. Every person knows exactly what he or she can buy with 1 or 10 or 100 or 1000 units of money in his or her economy – today. Everyone also knows that the real value of money is eroded over time in an inflationary economy and increases over time in a deflationary economy. 

Yes, the special bank paper that fiat bank notes is made of and the metals that fiat bank coins are made of have almost no intrinsic value as opposed to the real value of the actual gold or actual silver in gold and silver coins of commodity money in the past. That is not a logical reason to state that fiat money has no intrinsic value. Every fiat monetary unit´s real value is determined by what it can buy today in an average consumer basket of goods and services. That generally changes every month.

It is equally misleading to state that fiat money is not fixed in value in terms of any objective standard. Even if today´s monetary units were linked to the price of gold they would not be fixed in real value in terms of an objective standard because the price of gold is not fixed and a fixed universal unit of real value has not yet been determined. 

Fiat money is money which generally has a monthly changing real value. Only the actual fiat bank notes and coins have insignificant real values. Notes and coins constitute only about 7% of the US money supply. 

All fiat monetary units – whether notes and coins or simply electronically represented virtual values - are legal tender in their respective economies.

All fiat functional currencies within economies have international exchange rates with the fiat functional currencies of other economies.

::Thank you for your response. The fact that fiat money is not legally convertible is made irrelevant by the indisputable fact that fiat money is legal tender. The fact that a creditable expert stated the simple fact that fiat money is not legally convertible - an administrative process - is true: it is a fact. That does not negate the fact that fiat money has real value, the change of which is indicated montly in the change in the Consumer Price Index. It is a fact - which is presented in a misleading manner in the article lead - that fiat money is not legally convertible. That fact does not negate the fact that all fiat money has a changing real value. The fact that fiat money has real value is so mainstream - 6 billion people know it and confirm it daily - 365 days a year - by using fiat money to buy and sell everything in all economies. The fact that fiat money has real value is confirmed once a month by about 155 to 200 economies world wide when monthly inflation indexes are published indicating the change in the real value of fiat money. It is thus misleading to imply - as the article lead does - that because it is a fact that fiat money can not administratively be converted at the central bank or any other bank, that fiat money has no value. The article should reflect the indisputable mainstream fact that fiat money has real value despite the fact that it is not legally convertible and that the bank paper bank notes are made of and metals bank coins are made of have no intrinsic value whereas historically gold and silver coins had intrinsic value equal to the real value of the gold and silver they were made of. The numerous publications of CPI values world wide are the absolutely creditable references to the fact that fiat money has real value. All statistics authorities - except the Argentinian statistics authority under the late President Nestor (that I know of) - are very creditible sources. The article lead should state that it is a mainstream fact that fiat money has real value and can only be converted into a foreign currency at a bank. The fact that fiat money can be converted into a foreign currency at most banks thus negates the statement that fiat money is not legally convertible.[[User:OhioWanderer|OhioWanderer]] ([[User talk:OhioWanderer|talk]]) 14:10, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

:::::I thought the 'convertible' bit referred to the right to demand gold instead of paper. In that sense, the fiat currencies are not convertible because the paper is not a representation of gold in store. Changing fiat money for another currency is nothing to do with convertibility. Not unless you can change your fiat money for another currency that IS convertible - and then actually get your gold. In a way, you have a point in that gold itself is a form of fiat money. It's very little use for anything except decoration, filling teeth (if they still do that with gold) and plating the connectors of overpriced hifi leads. All money represents the potential of goods, and an easily portable way of transferring ownership of goods without the difficulties of someone who makes bows needing an axe, but the person who makes axes wants bricks not a bow. In actual intrinsic value, a dime is worth more than a sovereign, because you could make arrowheads or fish-hooks with it - if society collapsed to a hunter-gatherer stage.

::::::Very good point: that the term convertible in the case of money always refers to convertibility into one single other item, namely, gold.

How do you maintain the real values of constant real value non-monetary items constant when a daily variable gold price is the "standard"?

:::Who said that royalty, politicians , bankers and merchants were logical? Money is a commodity not a measure. It's worth what people think it's worth. Distance, temperature and volume can be defined by standards. 'Weight' is dependent on gravity, but as we spend most of our time on the surface of this planet the 'mass' measurement will suffice as a standard. How can you have a standard that is fixed and never-changing for money? The nearest I can think of in terms of money measurement is the Mars Bar standard sometimes used here in the UK. But even that fails as relative prices of other products have changed differently. PCs were around £1000 to £3000 at one time. The one I'm using here cost £110 - new earlier this year. Mars Bars have increased in price... The only standard for money is to arbitrarily take one commodity and use that. Gold, silver, copper, cattle, cowrie shells, iron, all these have been tried. Iron rusts. Cowrie shells can be imported from their beaches. Cattle can be bred - and can also die of disease. Copper is common and easily smelted. Gold and silver had the advantage of being relatively useless, distinctly pretty, and fairly corrosion-free - and there wasn't much of them around. The Spanish imports of gold from the New World did very nasty things to their domestic economy and that of the rest of Europe too. Gold was a practical standard once. When it was rare. But, when you give up carting gold around and switch to using bits of paper representing gold, you are reaching the faith test. Do you believe that the Blankshire Bank has the gold in its cellars? If you don't know, you have to depend on reputation. Read Terry Pratchett's book 'Making Money'. Very funny, but with a lot underneath the comedy.

::::Money is first and foremost a medium of exchange: without that function it cannot be money. It is also a store of value which you equate to being a commodity. I would agree. I do, however, adhere to the fact that it has three functions: the third being a unit of account. Money illusion makes us think that money is stable over time. However, we also know it is not. Measuring constant real value non-monetary items (salaries, rent, capital, trade debtors, etc) in units of constant purchasing power – inflation or deflation adjusting them – keeps the real value of these items constant forever only in companies that at least break even. You state that money is worth what people think it is worth. People think it is worth the same all the time (money illusion). The CPI is the lie-detector. The CPI is critical to inflation-adjust constant real value non-monetary items to keep their real values constant forever – in companies that break even. The monthly CPI sorts out the problems with money not being a constant unit of account during low inflation and deflation. The daily US Dollar parallel rate does the same during hyperinflation. You ask: “How can you have a standard that is fixed and never-changing for money?” Zero inflation does the trick – theoretically. In practice it leads to long term deflation because the generally accepted global Historical Cost Accounting model implements the stable measuring unit assumption during low inflation as well as deflation: constant items are not inflation- and deflation-adjusted during low inflation and deflation under the HCA model; a fundamental problem: under low inflation it destroys the real value of equity in companies with insufficient revaluable fixed assets and under deflation it increases the real value of equity and salaries increasing the deflation mentalité. Permanently sustainable zero inflation would be permanently sustainable financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power. We still do not know how to operate our economies at permanently sustainable zero inflation. Zero inflation is not required. Low inflation is fine only if the HCA model is abandoned with the stable measuring unit assumption and financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power as authorized in IFRS in the Framework, Par 104 (a) is implemented. That would maintain the constant real value of constant real value non-monetary items (eg. equity) constant forever in companies that at least break even.

::::Thank you for the book suggestions. I will add them to my current list: Geoffrey Whittington´s latest book and Jeff Kingston´s “Contemporary Japan.” BTW I read Whittington´s 1983 classic "Inflation Accounting" because he asked me in 2005 why I have not read it and I could not believe my eyes when the term stable measuring unit assumption was not mentioned even once in the entire book. I did not tell him that that was the exact reason I never read a single book on inflation accounting: I knew they were all wrong: so why read them. They all think inflation destroys the real value of non-monetary items when Friedman specifically stated almost 50 years ago: "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." Inflation or hyperinflation has no effect on the real value of non-monetary items. [[User:OhioWanderer|OhioWanderer]] ([[User talk:OhioWanderer|talk]]) 21:23, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

The Mars Bar standard was brought in by possibly the Daily Mail to counter the old fogey chant of things like "When I were a lad, you could get drunk, take a bird to the dance, and get chips and t'last tram 'ome and still have change out of half a crown". In the reign of Elizabeth I, a goose cost 1 penny. A labourer's wage was a penny ha'penny. How much different is a turkey (we can get geese where I live, but turkey is the modern equivalent) in price relative to a modern labourer's wage? I agree that a universal (OK, all-Earth really - the inhabitants of Arcturus 14B might not want to join as they're notoriously independent minded) currency might be good. Some smaller nations have dealt with the financial problem by simply adopting a major currency, the dollar or the euro. But who is going to run the currency - and just visualise the reaction from the <s>leeches</s> people who make their money from selling money. Perhaps that's what Jesus meant when he turned the currency dealers out of the Temple... You couldn't have the dollar or the rouble or the yuan (not till they own us totally). An early attempt at a regional currency was the mark in Germany, replacing several local systems. The euro is a better shot - but can you imagine the Republicans accepting it?

Change all currencies at a predetermined rate into the new Currency like it was done with the Euro. There you are. Inflation has to be kept at zero per cent. If it is not kept at zero percent then the Historical Cost Accounting model (financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units), or, more specifically, the stable measuring unit assumption, has to be abandoned and the accounting model has to be changed to financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power as authorized in IFRS in the Framework, Par 104 (a) which states ''"Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power."'' This is only required if inflation is not at zero percent. So, it has to be done, just in case of positive inflation or deflation. That is it. Done.

:If I recall correctly, I don't believe there are any commodity-backed currencies in circulation in any countries today. I can't seem to find any source that suggests otherwise, so until one surfaces I think it's safe to assume that all currencies in circulation are fiat currencies. The only exception would probably be the currency that (at any given time) serves as the world's foremost [[reserve currency]], which is currently the [[USD]] (and before that, the [[GBP]]), because many crucial commodities are predominantly denominated in reserve currencies when traded (would be more of a quasi-fiat, but certainly not commodity-backed). Another unique quasi-fiat might be the [[Special Drawing Rights|Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)]] issued by the [[IMF]], which you could conceptually think of as currencies (though they're really assets) based on a market basket of [[hard currency|hard currencies]]. The value of each of the underlying currencies in the portfolio of an SDR are still fiat in nature, but the value of the SDR is based on the market-determined value of the basket of currencies, rather than faith & confidence in the IMF. I will certainly be interested to learn of any government or central bank issuing anything other than fiat currency for circulation.

Honestly and in plain language, ALL currency is fiat.  Gold has no intrinsic value.  It is only valuable because it is relatively rare and it's pretty, so our ancestors, by fiat, decided this otherwise useless junk had value because it was nice to look at.  Gold has no inherent value... unless you believe in alchemy.  You can't eat it.  You can't build with it.  It's only real practical value is as a conductor or a plating to prevent corrosion, and those uses are VERY recent.  If we valued gold for it's actual useful properties instead of just because we arbitrarily decided it was valuable (again, fiat) it might be worth just a bit more than copper.  People screeching because governments have decided to arbitrarily attribute value to things other than the arbitrarily valuable gold makes me laugh.  Whatever we choose to use as currency, it's ALL arbitrary and fiat unless we go to a totally barter economy. And carrying cows and sheep around to trade with is really inconvenient.

:Ryoko, the problem is not that fiat currency has no value except as a trading commodity, but that governments arbitrarily increase the supply of currency at their own whim (thus devaluing the value of currency held by third parties). This is the real issue, not whether currency has any "intrinsic value" (whatever that means), and the reason why decentralized crypto currencies like Bitcoins and Peercoins are starting to take off. The reason people favor gold over government fiat currency is not because they think gold is "intrinsically useful" as you make it seem in your comment (which would be a complete straw man), but because the government cannot arbitrarily increase the supply of gold from thin air, unlike the case with fiat currency.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/23.16.124.201|23.16.124.201]] ([[User talk:23.16.124.201|talk]]) 01:54, 15 November 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:This is just plain wrong.  Gold absolutely has value.  Ignoring the 15% of mined gold consumed in industrial processing, it is still wrong to believe that the desire for aesthetic fulfillment (jewelry, etc.) is valueless.  That is the whole point of the psychological theory of value that all modern schools of economics subscribe.  Demand is driven by an inherent human drive that is fulfilled with it's purchase and ownership - ie. consumed.  This is completely different from speculative holding that purchases a commodity simply in the hopes of selling the commodity for greater value, where there is real possibility of failing to achieve the drive (more value) that drove the purchase.  They have completely different purchase patterns, different sources of valuation, etc.  Inherent value is measured by demand for consumption, which can be measured.  It may seem spooky and ethereal that it is psychological (which is why things like the labor theory of value had some legs for a time a few centuries back), but that is what value is.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ex0du5 5utu7e|Ex0du5 5utu7e]] ([[User talk:Ex0du5 5utu7e|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ex0du5 5utu7e|contribs]]) 01:13, 10 December 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The trouble with this article is that it is being edited by a lot of people who don't know what money is because they haven't taken basic economics in university, when an advanced degree in economics is required to understand it. They are nonetheless very opinionated despite their lack of knowledge and put forward all kinds of weird theories of their own, which violate the [[Wikipedia:No original research]] rule. I don't purport to be an expert on economic theory, but I do have enough courses in the subject to have declared it to be my minor on my first degree. But I deemed math to be my minor instead. I find the Canadian examples to be quite illustrative of the differences. The original Canadian money was the beaver pelt - obviously a commodity money since it could be traded to Europe to be turned into hats. It was supplanted by French gold and silver, which was easier to carry but was always in short supply. One year the payroll ships didn't arrive with the gold and silver to pay the soldiers, and since not paying the soldiers was not a good idea, the authorities in New France invented playing card money. They cut up playing cards, wrote an amount on the pieces, signed them, and gave them to the troops in lieu of gold or silver. This was one of the original fiat currencies, and the French authorities had a great deal of difficulty making it go away. It kept circulating for years even after the payroll ships arrived from France carrying gold and silver. It fulfilled a purpose, as a medium of exchange, which is what all modern fiat currencies do. Beaver pelts = commodity money, playing cards = fiat money, gold and silver = a combination of both. Gold and silver coins have both a face value and a commodity value, which are usually drastically different.

Isn't this text suspect?
:"Today, all national currencies are fiat currencies, including the US dollar, the euro, and all other reserve currencies. This trend began with the Nixon Shock of 1971, which ended the backing by precious metal of the U.S. dollar."
Given that Britain dropped the Gold Standard in 1931, and the French Franc (for the second time) in 1936, to name but two examples, isn't it the case that the Dollar was a late-departer rather than a trend-setter?

Given that the value of the US dollar, along with other modern money, is regulated through open market operations, it is hard to understand how it fits the definition of fiat money. The thing that makes fiat money "fiat" is that the state mandates a fixed price for a commodity, e.g. when the government demands that its debased coins be treated as the equivalent of gold coins. This is an entirely different situation from setting a target price for a commodity (or other measure of value, such as bond interest rates) and using open market operations to attain that target. The fact that the open market operations are used to buy and sell bonds rather than gold makes no difference in deciding whether the money is a fiat money. Open market operations are the antithesis of fiat. [[User:Mazzula|Mazzula]] ([[User talk:Mazzula|talk]]) 16:19, 8 June 2011 (UTC)

:Your points strike me as original research. Whether money is ''fiat'' is hinged on whether money is decreed to be recognized as ''having value'' (or ''having acceptance''), not on ''what that value is'' in terms of price. Your statement that ''"The thing that makes fiat money "fiat" is that the state mandates a fixed price for a commodity..."'' is erroneous, because a mandated commodity price (or a commodity price at all) is not what gives value to fiat money, and is also not what determines/measures the value of fiat money.

== Gold vs. Specie ==

This sentence doesn't make sense: ''"Attempts were made to reassert currency stability by anchoring it to wholesale gold bullion rather than making it payable in specie."'' I thought I understood this article until this point, but I thought "specie" meant things like gold. If gold isn't a form of specie, than what is meant by "specie"? —[[Special:Contributions/75.4.242.162|75.4.242.162]] ([[User talk:75.4.242.162|talk]]) 20:14, 3 June 2011 (UTC)

:I think that there is a distinction in that "specie" generally refers to coins that have been minted of a precious metal. So, if we are talking about gold, then all specie is gold, but not all gold is specie. Specie is government-certified to have a particular weight and purity (when minted). But I think that the distinction in the article is not so much between gold and specie, but between "making it payable" and other forms of anchoring, such as by fiat. The problem with the other forms of anchoring was that they didn't work. They didn't prevent the market value of the money from diverging from its nominal value in gold. This problem was solved by returning to a system based on open market operations, although at the "cost" of disentangling currency speculation from commodity speculation. Once the dollar was no longer nominally tied to gold prices, there was no need to maintain the restrictions on individuals owning gold bullion, so we ended up in a good situation where there was a generally stable currency (far more stable than the value of gold) together with the ability of individuals to legally own gold as a store of value. You can even buy specie (such as the American Eagle) from the US mint. So it seems that the author of the article doesn't like what Nixon did, but it is hard to understand exactly what the complaint is. After Nixon, there was less fiat and more access to specie. [[User:Mazzula|Mazzula]] ([[User talk:Mazzula|talk]]) 16:45, 8 June 2011 (UTC)
::Thank you for clarifying. In light of this, I wonder if the article should define "specie" at the beginning. I could alter the first sentence where it's mentioned to look like this: ''"While specie-backed representative money entails the legal requirement that the bank of issue redeem it in fixed weights of specie (minted [[coin]]s), fiat money's value is..."'' I also wonder if the definition of fiat money could be revised. In the sentence ''"neither legally convertible to any other thing"'', the word ''thing'' could maybe be replaced by ''scarce resource'' or something like that, to indicate that it's something that is in demand outside the currency system. (In other words, not just another fiat currency.) —[[User:MiguelMunoz|MiguelMunoz]] ([[User talk:MiguelMunoz|talk]]) 18:34, 8 June 2011 (UTC)
::It might be good to simply replace the word 'specie' where it occurs with 'gold' or 'gold and silver' or 'gold coins'.  As it is, we are using an obscure word where a perfectly clear word or phrase could do the job with no loss of meaning.  If we accept the definition of specie as being specifically gold coins, we may already be misusing it. For example, the 'Characteristics' section talks of 'specie-backed representative money'.  Has there ever been such a thing, in the sense of money backed specifically by gold and silver coins, rather than bullion in a vault?  I would suggest going back to the source, except that there is no source for this paragraph.  In the interests of boldness, I have replaced 'specie' with 'gold or silver' in this paragraph.  It may be appropriate to do likewise with the other occurrences of 'specie'. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 06:02, 12 August 2012 (UTC)
:::Miguel - regarding the word 'thing', the problem with adding anything to the sentence, such as 'scarce resource' is that this claim is sourced to JM Keynes.  We cannot change the meaning without making it our own analysis, or at least our own synthesis.  The word 'thing' is a bit clumsy.  This was my attempt at paraphrase.  You can see the original in the  reference - ' not convertible by law into anything other than itself, and has no fixed value in terms of an objective standard'. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 06:15, 12 August 2012 (UTC)

== Quotes section ==

Is the quotes section necessary? So far, it only contains quotes commenting negatively on fiat money. I think it would be best to integrate criticisms of fiat money into the article and not have a simple quotes section that ultimately just serves the purpose of a criticism section (though it isn't labeled as such). I think doing so would improve the comprehensiveness of the article. The quotes section seems like a mere list of displaced quotes. Research-based criticisms of fiat money, rather than happenstance remarks by famous people, would be more useful in an encyclopedic work, I think.

==Initial value by government decree==
The first part of the lead sentence is unobjectionable, and agrees with the first two, sourced, definitions in the 'characteristics' section.  However, I have removed the second part: 'the initial value of fiat money is established by government decree'. It is not obviously based on any source, and is not obviously accurate.  The lead stands perfectly well without it.  The important question is: is there a source for this?     I am not randomly asking for its removal - it strikes me as inaccurate, or perhaps meaningless.   What was the initial  value of the U.S. dollar on the day it became a fiat currency, and was that value due to 'government decree'?  Anyway, I say this simply to explain my motivation.  My main point is: what is the source for this 'initial value' claim? - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 06:46, 12 August 2012 (UTC)

== History Problems ==

This article is very confused about history. Fiat currency was clearly in use in ancient times, for example, the article on Roman currency (which links here) clearly establishes the use of fiat currency in the form of bronze coins in the 200s BCE. At best, the article conflates fiat (or fiduciary) currency with paper currency giving a history of the latter, and at worse might be indulging in revisionism. In any case, the (significant) use of fiat currency in ancient times, and the experience of the Romans with it, is entirely neglected. I expect if I looked I'd find other ancient examples besides Rome. [[Special:Contributions/216.243.60.172|216.243.60.172]] ([[User talk:216.243.60.172|talk]]) 19:15, 30 June 2013 (UTC)

And according to economist Michael Hudson of the University of Missouri, Kansas City, one of the preeminent money historians, fiat money was found in ancient Babylonia, Sumer and Sumeria. None of these garner even a mention here. [[User:Fashoom|Fashoom]] ([[User talk:Fashoom|talk]]) 22:04, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

:I agree it should be updated, it's not just the Romans that are missing out. I would do so myself if I knew how. I came across from the currency section of the [[Roman_Empire#Currency_and_banking|Roman Empire]] article as it explicitly link here, only to find that it only goes as far back as "11th century China". Needless to say there is a discrepancy. I think it would also be prudent to change the article on a slightly larger scale too, seeing as there doesn't seem to be a definite consensus on when the first proper fiat money was in circulation. Instead of proclaiming any of the above to be "the first use", simply denote it in chronological order, perhaps with a "the first known use of ..." Does anyone know of any good sources pertaining to the fiat currencies of antiquity? It would be nice to build up a repository of information before undergoing a rewrite on this scale. I know this seems kind of dead, but it would be useful. Cheers.

==Lead image==
The most widely used example of a fiat currency, at least in the English speaking world, is the U.S. dollar.   It is better to illustrate the article with the most typical example of the subject, not the oldest example, so we should lead with a picture of the current U.S. dollar, not a Yuan dynasty banknote.  I admit other articles go with the 'oldest' approach - such as '[[Automobile]]'.   I would seek to change that too if I were interested enough in the subject.  '[[Airplane]]' is more like it - it leads with a picture of a 737, probably the most widely used aircraft today, rather than the [[Wright Flyer]]. In the case of fiat currency, I take 'most widely used' to mean that currency which has the largest money supply by value. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 07:16, 24 August 2013 (UTC)

That reasoning could imply that every article about anything to do with money or currency, or maybe even finance and investing for that matter, should have the US dollar as the lead image.  Since all currencies (to our knowledge) are fiat these days, the USD does not have any particular distinction in the context of this topic, and the impact of its image would be little more than to say, "this article has something to do with money".  The currently-pictured Chinese currency does have a distinction in the context of fiat money:  it was the first one. -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 21:34, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

== messing with Mankiw ==

I '''reverted''' Adavidson99's edit of 23 January 2014 because the original Mankiw quote was accurate, and Adavidson99's revision substantially misquotes the cited source.

I can't claim to know why someone would go out of their way to change an accurate quote to a false one, but I do suspect that the original quote is a bit "inconvenient" to certain factions (such as the pro-Bitcoin community, who might not be in favor of any definition of fiat that could include Bitcoin...  not accusing anyone, just saying, there have been NPOV issues on this topic before, so I'm not surprised to see this kind of edit).  -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 21:52, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
:Adavidson99 didn't misquote the cited source - he changed to a different quote from the same book.  The cite for his version was ''''Fiat money''' money without intrinsic value that is used as money because of government decree'.   That appears in a sidebar in the text [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gV8HAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA644&dq=%22Fiat+money+money+without+intrinsic+value+that+is+used+as+money+because+of+government+decree%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GZTjUoqIHNKWhQfF3wE&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Fiat%20money%20money%20without%20intrinsic%20value%20that%20is%20used%20as%20money%20because%20of%20government%20decree%22&f=false].   The formatting is confusing.  It's not clear to me why a definition was set to the side of main text like that, especially when the main text just to the right states 'Money without intrinsic value is called fiat money'.  However, Adavidson99 is not guilty of mis-quoting.  I'm somewhat inclined to prefer Adavidson99's version, because the quote he cites explicitly defines fiat money, where the existing quote does not explicitly define it.   My only concern is the confusing way it is laid out in the Mankiw book - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 10:47, 25 January 2014 (UTC)
::I just noticed the main text goes on to say 'fiat money is established as money by government decree'.  Mankiw makes his views on the nature of fiat money explicit here in the main text, so I support Adavidson99's change. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 11:15, 25 January 2014 (UTC)

OK, I see what happened.  Adavidson99 changed the citation to p. 851 but the hyperlink still went to p. 659.  I followed the hyperlink and compared that to his quotation, and concluded that he had misquoted.

Comparing the three bullet items in the lead, it seems that the criteria for being fiat (according to the first bullet) is government decree, or (according to the third bullet) having no intrinsic value, or (according to the middle bullet) the combination of the two criteria together.  Adavidson99's edit seems to have the effect of making the third bullet synonymous with the second (i.e., it simply adds the criterion of government decree).  So perhaps the proper edit would have been to remove the third bullet?  Or is there some reason why the 2nd and 3rd wouldn't be synonymous with the edit in place?

Next question, looking at pages 644, 659, and 851, we see that Mankiw in some cases seems to be defining fiat money with the single criterion (e.g., p. 659), while in other cases, he specifies that fiat money is established by government decree.  Are both criteria fundamental to the definition, or is the part about "government decree" just an operational characteristic (like Webster including "four-wheeled" in its definition of "car" even though that characteristic may not be fundamental)?

Considering the above, I can see that a case can be made for some kind of edit.  The case for leaving it alone is that the current text still seems factual ("Fiat money has been defined variously as...", and one can find all three kinds of definitions).  I'd suggest leaving it alone until we get some clarity or consensus on the above questions.  -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 20:50, 25 January 2014 (UTC)
:The page 659 definition seems to suggest that government decree is inessential.  My reading is that page 851 is definitive, in that it explicitly defines fiat money there, while page 659 is a summary.  I originally added the page 659 definition back in 2010 specifically because it was a 'non-government-decree' definition which was an alternative, from a major economist, to the existing two definitions.   Now that the page 851 definition has been pointed out, I feel that the Mankiw text no longer clearly supports a 'non-decree' definition.  As you say, if the Mankiw definition is not a 'non-decree' definition, it is a bit redundant.   It would be reasonable to remove it altogether.  The lack of clarity from that source is another good reason to remove it. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 21:33, 25 January 2014 (UTC)

Well, then it seems the 3rd bullet has no support.  I also checked the other reference on that bullet (Shubik), and it says "a government supplied means of payment with no intrinsic worth" (footnote on first page).  It's odd that Mankiw would leave out the 'decree' criterion on p. 659, and also in the p. 644 statement "Money without intrinsic value is called fiat money".  Perhaps he didn't imagine that non-commodity money could exist without the power of government decree behind it, so he felt it was implied.  The only way I can see to support the 3rd bullet is to use the original Latin meaning of fiat, "let it be done", which seems to mean a declaration by anyone (like someone who creates a cryptocurrency and says, "here, this is money").  But I don't know of any published works that support a "non-governmental declaration" meaning of fiat.

There's also a problem with the first bullet.  US gold coins are currently legal tender in the US (at face value), so according to the article as it stands now, they are fiat money.  But if you look at the cited source, Rollins' (the author's) complete explanation of fiat seems to specify that money is fiat only to the extent that the face value exceeds the intrinsic value, and for US gold coins, the reverse is currently the case.  So are US gold coins fiat money, or not?

Also, Rollins' and Mankiw's definitions of fiat seem to disagree for, say, US nickels.  Rollins would say they are fiat money (because their value, 0.05 USD, has a fiat component).  Mankiw says fiat money "would be worthless if it were not used as money", and for US nickels, that is not the case (as they are made of copper and nickel).  So are US nickels fiat money, or not?

(I'm not going to get into how many BTUs are generated by burning paper dollars, because I'm pretty sure Mankiw wouldn't count that!)

Complicating things further is the [[private currency]] article which states, "Private Currency is the opposite of the fiat currency" (unsourced text added 23 Jan 2009).  Mankiw's p. 659 text seems to characterize commodity money as being the opposite of fiat money (on the basis of whether is has value if not used as money).  So then does "private money" equal "commodity money"?  I don't think so.  I will add a comment on the talk page over there.

Maybe a whole new taxonomy for money is needed.  But we can't do original research here! -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 21:06, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

Just to clarify:  My US nickels example simply shows a possible distinction between the 1st and 3rd bullets (so this does not imply the need for an edit).  But my US gold coin example shows a possible error in the article, in that it does not represent Rollins accurately.  Perhaps the first bullet should be changed to something like, "any money declared by a government to be legal tender, at a face value higher than intrinsic value."  But then it's nearly indistinguishable from the 2nd bullet.  The 3rd bullet could still be considered distinct, even if the 'government decree' part is added, because it specifies that the money has no intrinsic value at all.  (But when we consider Keynes observation, "now generally made of paper", the distinctions among all the definitions seem to become insignificant, and especially if the definitions are meant for currency systems rather than specific instruments like nickels.)

So the point is that the 1st and 3rd bullets don't accurately represent the cited sources.  The other point is that it's unclear whether the differences between bullets are substantial or just wording differences.  -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 23:07, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

There is a definition of fiat money in the "Monetary economics" section (citing Walsh) that does not include government-decree.  It seems that this would support the 3rd bullet (as it stands now, "''money without intrinsic value''") or possibly a bullet of its own in the lede.  -- [[User:HLachman|HLachman]] ([[User talk:HLachman|talk]]) 12:05, 29 January 2014 (UTC)

Why the desire to define fiat money in such a way that it excludes the ultimate fiat money, bitcoin? I realize that people keep adding and removing bitcoin from this article and I'm not going to get into that. But there are sources that define fiat money without requiring that the source of the fiat be the government. So editors who insert the government decree part seem to have an agenda here rather than NPOV. Economists have, as far as I can tell, not bothered to create a new name for non-governmental-fiat currency. If it's not a fiat currency, what is it? Mankiw defines fiat money both with the government reference and without. Cherry picking just the ones that mention the government misrepresents the source. In a section where he talks about the government, he specifically says "the acceptance of fiat money depends as much on expectations and social convention as on government decree."  Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The only value it has is due to "expectations and social convention" and the fact that other people are willing to exchange goods for it. ---[[User:Vroo|Vroo]] ([[User talk:Vroo|talk]]) 02:49, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

== New France 1685-1770 ==

I added a section on the Playing Card Money in New France because it is the purest example of a fiat currency I know of. It's a textbook case. Take a plain old playing card, print a value on it, sign it, and there you have it - real money. It lasted nearly a century and if people had paid any attention to the monetary principles behind why it worked, they could have saved themselves a lot of trouble over the ensuing centuries. At least they could have avoided a lot of stupid theories. [[User:RockyMtnGuy|RockyMtnGuy]] ([[User talk:RockyMtnGuy|talk]]) 23:24, 12 February 2014 (UTC)

==Citations defining fiat money==

Hi all. I read the fiat money definitions in the lead using citations of authorities and compared them to the referenced sources. I think that all definitions in the lead were seriously distorted by leaving out substantial parts of the originals:

* Montgomery Rollins' definition: the major part of the definition was omitted (the part mentioning the relation between face value and real value). Without it, the definition is seriously distorted acquiring a substantially different meaning.

* John Maynard Keynes' definition: the part mentioning the divorce between the intrinsic value and the nominal value was left out. Without it, the definition is seriously distorted as well, missing the important part.

* Gregory Mankiw's and Martin Shubik's definition: the part mentioning the government decree was left out from the definitions in both sources. Such an omission changes the meaning of the definition in a significant way.

The undistorted versions of the definitions of fiat money from the various sources are essentially in agreement, the differences between the definitions being substantially smaller than the article lead using the distorted versions suggests. I think that this needs a serious correction [[User:Ladislav Mecir|Ladislav Mecir]] ([[User talk:Ladislav Mecir|talk]]) 18:23, 22 February 2014 (UTC)

==New lead sentence==
The new lead sentence states 'Fiat money is money, often issued and controlled by a government, which is not backed by any physical quantity'.  All the sources for the definitions in the previous lead defined money as something controlled, issued, or defined by the state.  The new lead defines fiat money in terms of a lack of 'backing'.  The new lead does not summarize or reflect the sourced definitions.  It is not itself sourced.  The concept of 'backing' is not defined.   The previous approach of providing multiple definitions was not ideal, but it is better to provide multiple sourced definitions than a single definition which does not reflect any of the sources. The previous version of the lead, written by [[User:Lawrencekhoo]], was also suitable: "Fiat money is money that derives its value from government regulation or law."  This accurately reflects the sources.   The article should either use the single Lawrencekhoo definition, which does summarize the sources, or list the multiple definitions which paraphrase the sources directly.  The current version does neither. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]]

:Mmm. There seems to be two different definitions. One is the fact that it's decreed (usually by the state), and the second is that it's allowed to float without having a backing, and where its value is controlled by monetary policy.

==Representative money==
The article currently states, "Although historically fiat money has often been [[representative money]] that can be reliably exchanged with a commodity such as gold, modern fiat currencies have no fixed conversion to any specific goods".   As far as I can tell, the basis for this statement in available sources is Keynes's statement,<blockquote>
Fiat Money is Representative (or token) Money (i.e something the intrinsic value of the material substance of which is divorced from its monetary face value) - now generally made of paper except in the case of small denominations — which is created and issued by the State, but is not convertible by law into anything other than itself, and has no fixed value in terms of an objective standard
</blockquote>
However, here Keynes has defined 'representative money' in terms of intrinsic value versus face value, while the lead defines representative money as something exchangeable for commodities.  The definitions do not match.   Keynes term has been taken, and attached to someone else's meaning.  Secondly, the lead suggests there has been some change in the nature of fiat money - that it *was* representative money, and is no longer representative money, due to its loss of exchangeability.    However, according to Keynes's definition, nothing has changed.   At the time he wrote this this, and before he wrote this, fiat money was something for which the intrinsic value differed from the face value, and today fiat money is something for which the intrinsic value differs from the face value.    Nothing has changed.  If we are going to reference Keynes for the claim that fiat money is representative money, we have to use the term in the way Keynes used it.   Of course, if we are *not* basing the claim on Keynes use of the term, then we are basing it on nothing - no other source claims that fiat money is representative money  - and the claim is unsourced.  Either way, this claim is not well sourced.  I will remove it. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 09:25, 1 March 2014 (UTC)

The article has been and still largely remains almost entirely uninformative about how fiat money works.

Stuff like: how is fiat money created, how is the removed, what institutions are involved, what systems it replaced, what views notable experts have on fiat money systems, details of major historical events that lead to it- these kinds of things are mostly or completely missing or have been unreasonably summarised out of the article; in many cases they have been edit warred out completely one or more times.

It is not a summary - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbie]] 20:40, 13 March 2014 (UTC)

:With all due respect, this is so very wrong on multiple levels. There's no rule that says you can't copy material within articles into the lead of the article.

:A very large amount of the fiat money that is in circulation is ''not'' created by the government, it's created inside commercial banks. When the government hands what is essentially a glorified IOU to a central bank, the bank then in turn hands out even more IOUs (in return for money, under fractional banking rules) to the commercial banks, and the commercial banks then lend against those IOUs (again under fractional banking rules) multiples times, because they are considered assets of the bank.

:The overall effect is that far more money enters circulation than was originally created by the central bank to give to the government in return for the IOUs.

:So when you go along to a bank and get a loan, they actually create fiat money on the spot (provided they have enough assets to legally do so) along with an overdraft. The fiat money then enters circulation, and that's the money you would actually spend in a takeaway.

:So fiat money ''isn't really created by the government or even the central bank,'' (well some of it is) but their control over it's value is actually very indirect, it depends on how much the bank wants and is able to lend out, which is why the banking crisis was such a very big deal (but that at least is outside the scope of this article).

:Nonsense. The use of [[WP:Subarticle]]s is a perfectly legitimate and useful part of Wikipedia, and in and of themselves they involve duplicating material.

I suspect that a couple of misunderstandings may have derailed your discussion on this. I will try to address those and then suggest how you may want to position the ''Inflation'' section.
# In fact [[WP:Subarticle]] is a redirect to [[Wikipedia:Article size#Splitting an article]] and is concerned solely with the process and the result when a section in a more general article (the parent) is a ''summary'' of a more detailed article (the child). For example, [[Insect#Reproductive system]] is a summary of [[Insect reproductive system]]. This is described in more detail in the documentation of [[Template:Main]] (along with a controversial usage that isn't the case here). The third paragraph of the template documentation says specifically: "Its usage should be restricted to the purposes described above." Now, this article on fiat money isn't a parent article to the [[Inflation]] article. Thus the use of {{tl|Main}} in the ''Inflation'' section is mistaken. (This may be the case for the use of {{tl|Main}} in other sections as well, though I haven't examined this carefully.
# All the same, there is no rule against copy-pasting from one Wikipedia article to another, provided that there is sufficient attribution and that the copy doesn't give rise to a POV fork now or in the future (remember that the section will get further edited over time). The details are in [[WP:COPYWITHIN]]. The edit summary for {{Diff2|601152754|the edit that copy-pasted the inflation text}} provides the required attribution, so I think your hands are clean on this.

In my view, this article doesn't need a section on the general concept of inflation, and including such a general description runs a real risk of giving rise a POV fork in the future. The concept itself is familiar enough that all that's needed for people who want more detail about it. The present article should of course discuss the relationship of fiat money to inflation. Do you think you can achieve agreement on that relationship with further discussion? If not, I think you need to call upon other experts to discuss it. Perhaps the best way to start that would be to post at [[WT:ECON]].

:::I had better clarify my advice. I pointed out that copy-paste from one Wikipedia article to another with attribution is allowed ''per se''. But I also suggested that it is inadvisable for this article to contain a summary-style introduction to inflation as a concept, especially because of the danger of it developing into a content fork.

But that is as far as we generally go: we don't provide a whole section of introduction. A reader who wants that may follow the wikilink and get a summary from the article in question. (And ''inflation'' isn't even an unfamiliar term. Anyone who doesn't understand it will have been left behind well before they reach that section.)

:::If that seems too restrictive, please consider what it would look like if every Wikipedia article contained a potted introduction to every major thing that it referred to. So, for example, someone developing the article on [[Johannes Brahms]] could write a section on the composers who influenced him, and use that as a [[WP:COATRACK]] for little half-page discussions of [<small>his own view of</small>] the style of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, ...

:::So my advice is to confine the discussion of inflation here strictly to the relationship between inflation and fiat money, and to exclude any summary-style introduction to the general topic of inflation. I hope that clarifies it. --[[User:Stfg|Stfg]] ([[User talk:Stfg|talk]]) 09:56, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

::::There's different degrees of strictly that could be used, at one pole we have crosbiesmith who will apparently only allow mention of hyperinflation. I've trimmed it down to what I consider to be a very reasonable degree; to my mind this article is about fiat money and the effects of fiat money.

:::::Thank you. Yes, it should be about fiat money. I'll leave it to you experts to negotiate the content of that section in detail.

::::::I respectfully disagree, a See also is probably inappropriate here because that implies that the topic is disjoint to this one but is more something you should also be aware of; whereas inflation is part of the overall topic of fiat money. I am recently seeing more wikilinking used as a shorthand instead of doing a main, to achieve nearly the same effect, but I'm sure that a main in this case is not in any way incorrect.

:The only paragraph in the fiat money section which is explicitly about fiat money is the paragraph beginning ' The adoption of fiat currency...'.

This particular quote, especially taken out of its context, doesn't really add any value for the reader. The article already conveys in its first sentence that fiat money is backed by government. Could you imagine the article on [[gravity]] saying something akin to ''"Gravity is most commonly recognized and experienced as the agent that gives weight to physical objects, and causes physical objects to fall toward the ground when dropped from a height.

:Wuerzele, please understand that we are not trying to be nitpick at your edits. I am challenging you to think about whether, and precisely how, your proposed edit would add value for the reader. Regarding your questions about factors other than verifiability, consider that Wikipedia values types of sources differently. For example, per [[WP:Identifying reliable sources]], "When available, academic and peer-reviewed publications, scholarly monographs, and textbooks are usually the most reliable sources." Although Paul Krugman is a very reliable academic on subjects directly and indirectly related to the article's topic, we already have sources of higher quality (scholarly works, such as the textbooks/monographs cited in the Definition section) for the definition of ''fiat money'' than Krugman's Business Insider interview containing the quote you wish to include. The context of his quote (in which he says fiat money is backed by men with guns) is that he is obviously criticizing (or at least contrasting) the legitimacy of [[cryptocurrency]] versus fiat currency. Krugman also defines fiat money as "backed ultimately by the fact that you pay taxes with it," yet you have selected in particular his subsequent statement that "fiat money, if you like, is backed by guns." Immediately at the end of that sentence, Krugman goes on to say "Bitcoin is not, so why should this thing have any value? And of course, it doesn't pay interest. On the other hand, maybe the ability to do transactions that you think... are invisible." Krugman is clearly comparing the legitimacy of fiat money (backed by government) to the legitimacy of bitcoin (not backed by government, but ostensibly backed by a complex algorithm with a definitely limited potential quantity). At the onset of the interview, Krugman even states "I mean, I basically think that it's the digital version for gold [[crank (person)|crank]]s..." Aside from the quote being redundant (as essentially just a version of "fiat currency is backed by government guarantee"), I think it is fair to voice, on behalf of Marek as well as myself, that including the quote at all, ''especially'' absent its context, appears to promote the idea that fiat currency's backing by government (and the coercion of law, or "men with guns") is somehow a bad thing, or otherwise a "nefarious" aspect of fiat currency. That is not a view held by Krugman, or a view supported by academic consensus or by a preponderance of the reliable scholarly literature on fiat money.

:: [[User:John Shandy]] Thanks for your reply. I can now see how you see it, but I do not see it that way. (We have met at the global financial system page a year ago and so I have seen how you tick, a bit.) You support Marek's revert of my sentence x 2. Your arguments: a) form: redundant, b) POV: Including the quote at all appears to promote the idea "fiat currency's backing by government  is somehow a bad thing (your interpretation) and c) form: absent context, a universal criticism applicable to almost any edit.  For a compromise [[WP:TALKDONTREVERT]], lets work from where we agree: you agreed on the source as valid ("a very reliable academic") and I agree the sentence has no context, of course.
Here are my counterarguments to your arguments/disagreements:
:: a) the sentence is not redundant, because it adds ''the meaning of force'', which I consider crucial semantics.  The power of a fiat currency is and feels different under different governments, a dictatorship, for example. (I assume you are a US citizen and have not lived under a dictatorship? universal )
The sentence also adds a differentiation from non-fiat currencies, such as bitcoin. That happens to be one important reason why readers turn to [[Fiat currency]].
::b} I am not promoting any particular POV. I simply inserted Paul Krugman's POV of a definition of fiat currency, the raw quote, even ATTRIBUTING the (reliable, mainstream) source. This is impartial tone, good research, gives balance, neither sympathizing nor disparaging, nor giving it undue weight, but due weight. You need to deliver proof. I am challenging you to think about precisely how, you see I introduced POV. It may turn out, that you may be biased in your interpretation of teh source in the first place and secondly by not allowing a quote that seems ... what? you havent said. Lastly, since you refer to WP values, like a teacher, I feel I may do the same: Regarding reverts, consider that Wikipedia values to "not remove sourced information from the encyclopedia solely on the grounds that it '''seems''' biased."
::c)the sentence has no context; fair enough, but you did not hear/ answer my q WHAT context you wish to see (see above). Absent suggestions of both you and Marek I will now choose whatever context I think fits best. I will mention the sentence that follows, which has the advantage that it shows "Krugman's view" of both fiat and bitcoin. The preceding sentence "backed ultimately by the fact that you pay taxes with it" would work also, and would include a non-nefarious aspect of fiat money, as you called it, but it would swell the issue significantly, where conciseness was the strength.--[[User:Wuerzele|Wuerzele]] ([[User talk:Wuerzele|talk]]) 00:51, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

:::I still to see any point in adding the quote. For starters, the "definition" section should provide the definition of fiat money. Examples, quips, anecdotes, even if made by prominent authorities such as Krugman, are not definitions. I also see no point in contrasting fiat money with bitcoin in this particular article. The subject of "Fiat Money" is a fairly general level topic and it should be treated in general fashion, and not include every tid bit of info someone can find out there that is just sort of relevant.[[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]] ([[User talk:Volunteer Marek|talk]]) 01:30, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

::::[[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]]. The above "reply" is stonewalling. Seeing 'no point' is actually a POV (undocumented).

:::Wuerzele, I consider my previous reply to have already explained the full context (the point Krugman was attempting to illustrate). To clarify what I meant when I credited Krugman as being a reliable academic: He certainly is one, but his scholarly publications would obviously be more reliable than his interviews with broadcast journalists. So for example, the scholarly works (by other academics) already cited in the Definition section are more reliable for the academic consensus definitions of fiat currency than Krugman's obviously facetious remarks in a Business Insider interview, in which he is making an effort to contrast the legitimacy of bitcoin with that of fiat currencies.

:::Krugman has authored numerous textbooks on economics. Here are a few examples from two of his textbooks in which he explains fiat money. Of course, I have only pasted small excerpts.
::::From Krugma, Paul. (2009) ''Economics'', 2nd Ed.
:::::Pg. 803 "U.S. dollar bills are pure fiat money: they have no intrinsic value, and they are not backed by anything that does."
:::::Pg. 815 "Remember, the modern dollar is fiat money, which isn't backed by anything. So the Fed can create additional monetary base at its own discretion."
::::From Krugman, Paul. (2009) ''Macroeconomics'', 2nd Ed.
:::::Pg. 385 (emphasis is Krugman's) "Money whose value derives entirely from its official status as a means of exchange is known as '''fiat money''' because it exists by government ''fiat'', a historical term for a policy declared by a ruler."
:::::Pg. 410 (emphasis is Krugman's) "Today the dollar is pure '''fiat money''', whose value derives solely from its official role."
:::::Pg. 446 "Modern economies use fiat money - pieces of paper that have no intrinsic value but are accepted as a medium of exchange. In the United States and most other wealthy countries, the decision about how many pieces of paper to issue is placed in the hands of a central bank that is somewhat independent of the political process. However, this independence can always be taken away if politicians decide to seize control of monetary policy."

:::Any of these would be more accurate to include than the quote from the Business Insider interview. If his Business Insider quote does belong anywhere on Wikipedia, do you not agree that it would be the [[Bitcoin]] article instead? And I would argue that including his quote as another "definition" ''could'' potentially give it undue weight (at least in comparison to his scholarly definitions). "Backed by men with guns" certainly isn't a ''literal'' definition of fiat money, and it isn't the definition he assigns in his textbooks. Fiat currencies are backed, as Krugman says, their "official role." Their official role derives from factors like: a country recognizes a specific currency as its national currency and citizens have confidence that its recognition will endure over a long period of time; a government requires you to denominate your tax payments in the country's nationally recognized currency; a government will enforce contracts and by extension require parties to contracts to accept the national currency as a medium of exchange. Why are the semantics of how a government enforces laws in support of a fiat currency's "official role" relevant? What do they help the reader to understand? With regards to Marek's reverts and the discussion here, aren't we just participating in an instance of [[WP:BRD]]?

I perceive ivory tower arrogance when you write "I consider my previous reply to have already explained the full context". But where s the productive collaboration to get to the compromise? That's exactly why this is not [[WP:BRD]. You stonewall too. Remember, that you also removed any and all edit I made (referenced) on [[global financial system]] which you expanded single-handedly (!) and sanitized to death. I perceive a narrow minded POV, unable to ''open'' to other POV's.

== Give the writer a break! ==

The article can't reflect the truth due to extreme enforcements in the real world.  I do believe that the writer tried in good faith to cover the subject.

The example with declared money supply (actual numbers) needs a disclaimer that independent auditing and law enforcement on the Federal Reserve are illegal at this time even though sampling and statistics might reflect a mismatch.
The article should have covered also counterfeiting and degradation (paper specs) as a temporary money supply.

As I said, some of the articles in Wiki need visible disclosures that the subject can't be covered truthfully or completely.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/162.254.168.5|162.254.168.5]] ([[User talk:162.254.168.5|talk]]) 12:27, 13 July 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:If I recall correctly, I don't believe there are any commodity-backed currencies in circulation in any countries today. I can't seem to find any source that suggests otherwise, so until one surfaces I think it's safe to assume that all currencies in circulation are fiat currencies. The only exception would probably be the currency that (at any given time) serves as the world's foremost [[reserve currency]], which is currently the [[USD]] (and before that, the [[GBP]]), because many crucial commodities are predominantly denominated in reserve currencies when traded (would be more of a quasi-fiat, but certainly not commodity-backed). Another unique quasi-fiat might be the [[Special Drawing Rights|Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)]] issued by the [[IMF]], which you could conceptually think of as currencies (though they're really assets) based on a market basket of [[hard currency|hard currencies]]. The value of each of the underlying currencies in the portfolio of an SDR are still fiat in nature, but the value of the SDR is based on the market-determined value of the basket of currencies, rather than faith & confidence in the IMF. I will certainly be interested to learn of any government or central bank issuing anything other than fiat currency for circulation.

Honestly and in plain language, ALL currency is fiat.  Gold has no intrinsic value.  It is only valuable because it is relatively rare and it's pretty, so our ancestors, by fiat, decided this otherwise useless junk had value because it was nice to look at.  Gold has no inherent value... unless you believe in alchemy.  You can't eat it.  You can't build with it.  It's only real practical value is as a conductor or a plating to prevent corrosion, and those uses are VERY recent.  If we valued gold for it's actual useful properties instead of just because we arbitrarily decided it was valuable (again, fiat) it might be worth just a bit more than copper.  People screeching because governments have decided to arbitrarily attribute value to things other than the arbitrarily valuable gold makes me laugh.  Whatever we choose to use as currency, it's ALL arbitrary and fiat unless we go to a totally barter economy. And carrying cows and sheep around to trade with is really inconvenient.  [[User:RyokoMocha|RyokoMocha]] ([[User talk:RyokoMocha|talk]]) 17:03, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
:Ryoko, the problem is not that fiat currency has no value except as a trading commodity, but that governments arbitrarily increase the supply of currency at their own whim (thus devaluing the value of currency held by third parties). This is the real issue, not whether currency has any "intrinsic value" (whatever that means), and the reason why decentralized crypto currencies like Bitcoins and Peercoins are starting to take off. The reason people favor gold over government fiat currency is not because they think gold is "intrinsically useful" as you make it seem in your comment (which would be a complete straw man), but because the government cannot arbitrarily increase the supply of gold from thin air, unlike the case with fiat currency.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/23.16.124.201|23.16.124.201]] ([[User talk:23.16.124.201|talk]]) 01:54, 15 November 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:This is just plain wrong.  Gold absolutely has value.  Ignoring the 15% of mined gold consumed in industrial processing, it is still wrong to believe that the desire for aesthetic fulfillment (jewelry, etc.) is valueless.  That is the whole point of the psychological theory of value that all modern schools of economics subscribe.  Demand is driven by an inherent human drive that is fulfilled with it's purchase and ownership - ie. consumed.  This is completely different from speculative holding that purchases a commodity simply in the hopes of selling the commodity for greater value, where there is real possibility of failing to achieve the drive (more value) that drove the purchase.  They have completely different purchase patterns, different sources of valuation, etc.  Inherent value is measured by demand for consumption, which can be measured.  It may seem spooky and ethereal that it is psychological (which is why things like the labor theory of value had some legs for a time a few centuries back), but that is what value is.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ex0du5 5utu7e|Ex0du5 5utu7e]] ([[User talk:Ex0du5 5utu7e|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ex0du5 5utu7e|contribs]]) 01:13, 10 December 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The trouble with this article is that it is being edited by a lot of people who don't know what money is because they haven't taken basic economics in university, when an advanced degree in economics is required to understand it. They are nonetheless very opinionated despite their lack of knowledge and put forward all kinds of weird theories of their own, which violate the [[Wikipedia:No original research]] rule. I don't purport to be an expert on economic theory, but I do have enough courses in the subject to have declared it to be my minor on my first degree. But I deemed math to be my minor instead. I find the Canadian examples to be quite illustrative of the differences. The original Canadian money was the beaver pelt - obviously a commodity money since it could be traded to Europe to be turned into hats. It was supplanted by French gold and silver, which was easier to carry but was always in short supply. One year the payroll ships didn't arrive with the gold and silver to pay the soldiers, and since not paying the soldiers was not a good idea, the authorities in New France invented playing card money. They cut up playing cards, wrote an amount on the pieces, signed them, and gave them to the troops in lieu of gold or silver. This was one of the original fiat currencies, and the French authorities had a great deal of difficulty making it go away. It kept circulating for years even after the payroll ships arrived from France carrying gold and silver. It fulfilled a purpose, as a medium of exchange, which is what all modern fiat currencies do. Beaver pelts = commodity money, playing cards = fiat money, gold and silver = a combination of both. Gold and silver coins have both a face value and a commodity value, which are usually drastically different.

===Other Types of Issuance than Fiat===
:No, not all currency is fiat. I'm adding this to the talk page instead of the main article because I think we'll need to track down some good scholarly references so it isn't considered original research, however this isn't new, rather it's old knowledge and rapidly being forgotten. As someone who has been in the currency design field for a long time I'd like clear up some of the misunderstandings and add my vote for adding a currency issuance typology on the main page. First, '''FIAT is about how a currency is ISSUED''', not about some absolute or intrinsic value. When it is spoken into being from nothing by authority (whether that authority is a king, a government, a bank, '''or even a crypocoin miner''' demonstrating their authority by having the right Proof-of-Work nonce), then the currency is a fiat currency. There are [http://artbrock.com/currencymap/](four main types of issuance) with a some sub-types.

# '''FIAT:''' Spoken into being / created from nothing. This is the meaning of the Latin word "fiat." Nobody is debited when new units are created. There may be policies/limitations about when or how much you can create units (like fractional reserve banking, or such), but units in this currency are created from nothing and will not be redeemed by the issuer for something else of value backing it.
# '''BACKED:''' Currency units are only created when a specified/known thing of value is deposited to back the currency being issued. The currency can also be redeemed for the thing backing it. Gold/silver/copper coins are an example. Gold is not a currency, it is a commodity, but when it is minted into a coin in accordance with known standards and measures, the coin becomes a currency which is backed by metal it's made of. There are many other examples of backed currencies like [http://www.berkshares.org/how_to_spend Berkshares] or [https://saltspringdollars.com/all-about-salt-spring-dollars/ Salt Spring Dollars] which are usable only with local businesses, but those businesses bring it to a local bank to be exchanged for dollars. Note a common point of confusion: Even though banks issue new money through loans, and sometimes those loans are SECURED by an asset, it does not mean the dollars created your mortgage are backed, because people can't redeem their dollars at the bank for your house. Also note the sub-type of PARTIALLY BACKED currencies.
# '''MUTUAL CREDIT:''' Mutual credit issuance works a lot like double-entry accounting. For anything credited to someone's account there is an offsetting debit from someone else's account. This means the net supply of the currency is ALWAYS ZERO. The active supply can be controlled by managing credit limits, and how far people can spend into the negative. Mutual credit is used in hundreds of online currency systems like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system LETS] and many [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_currency#Time_banks Time Banks] and there are only recently emerging crypto-currencies using mutual credit issuance ([https://files.holo.host/2017/11/Holo-Currency-White-Paper_2017-11-28.pdf Holo] [https://forum.duniter.org/t/why-your-coin-is-a-fiat-currency-and-not-a-mutual-credit/2668 Duniter])
# '''COMPUTED:''' A computed currency is created purely as derived from other currencies computationally. Some might argue it is technically not issued at all, and yet some computed currencies are traded and seem to "exist" so they had to come into existence in some way. Example, The Dow Jones Index is calculated from a selection of other major stocks (Note: Stocks are a FIAT currency created by the companies that issue them as the sole authority of their shares of ownership.). If it stopped there, then you could say it isn't really an issued currency at all, but the fact that there are indexed funds which trade against the Dow alters this dynamic. It is certainly not created by FIAT, nor is it BACKED, nor MUTUAL CREDIT.

:For me, this typology is so clear and real that I fear I'm not the most neutral person to figure out how to post it to the main article, but it seems to me that the main reason someone would come to a page about Fiat money is to '''understand how it is different from other types of money'''. People are so confused about this that everyone is just saying there are no other other types of currency. Additional confusion has been introduced by the cryptocurrency community who refers to national currencies as fiat even though they are also issuing all their cryptocoins by an act of fiat, it is just that the authority cycles around based on a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-bank-charter. In each case, the the PROOF is about their authority to take this action which creates money from nothing. Any suggestions for the best way to integrate these distinctions into the page contents?

== Lead ==

The lead (which BTW is too short) says "The first use of fiat money was recorded in China around 1000 AD. Since then, it has been used continuously by various countries, concurrently with commodity currencies."

I believe all nations use fiat money now, so why not simply say that? And what are these "commodity currencies" used supposedly "concurrently". Where is that? Is this concurrent use common or do you know of only a few instances?

== Claim that fiat money originated in China ==

I'm removing this claim. The source cited - ''Adaptive Learning and the Transition to Fiat Money'' - only says the following:

'' A government monopoly of paper money was established early in the 11th century. Around the turn of the 12th century, convertibility was suspended, introducing what '''may have been''' the world's first fiat money''

This is mere speculation, emphasis mine. I think it stems from conflation of paper money with fiat money. 

Some economic historians claim that authorities have always been involved in the ensuring the value of money throughout history, even back to ancient Mesopotamia. This is supported by Graeber's ''Debt'', Alfred Mitchell-Innes ''What is money?'', and lectures by L. Randall Wray. Whilst Graeber isn't an economic historian, ''Debt'' is quite well sourced and I think would make a good starting point for finding source material for this page.

This is all related to the issues mentioned [[Talk:Fiat_money#History_Problems|here]], and when I get the time to do more research I hope to improve the historical accuracy of this page.

The definition at [http://xrefer.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=445276&secid=.-] sounds a little different...
:yes, but the word "ficuciary' carries a lot of weight.  These definitions at xrefer are strictly from neoclassical theory, they are not balanced for the Marxist or green view, which requires more investigation of the assumptions... for instance the term ficuciary.  That said, it doesn't hurt to wrok off the neoclassicl definitions, since they're exact.  That said, this article has a problem, which is that "fiat money" is really a loaded term.  We should talk about backing and clearing, not about "types of money" if we want to be general.    See [[political economy]] for a list of the issues - the neoclassical phrases are chosen to be useful in game theory etc.... not what the other branches care about. --24 (signature appended by [[user:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske]])

The last paragraph says something like 'Between the end of World War II, ...' - that doesn't make sense, there should be two times for a 'between' statement.

----

The article leaves an impression that the gold standard was a kind of widespread historical standard without qualification other than that the silver standard was an alternative.  In fact, the gold standard only became widespread quite recently, due to widespread western wealth.  When societies were poor, the standard was whatever people could afford.  Thus the usage of lesser metals like silver (the British pound was original a pound weight of sterling silver, thus Pound Sterling) or copper (Roman sestercii), or even non-metals.

Will someone correct it, or should I?

Is Ultra-conservative the right word to use in describing those who support the gold standard?

== Strange wording ==

''Fiat Money = What your government forces you to pay as payment in taxes. You can't pay taxes to the government with Non Fiat Money. Both the Gold and Silver advocates and the Fiat Money advocates are incorrect and wrong.

== Fiat money is not government-declared? ==

[http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/11/gold-a-six-thousand-year-old-bubble/ This article] says fiat money is money with no intrinsic value, rather than money that is declared by the government to have value.

:Unlike what Wikipedia says on the subject, the essence of fiat money is not that it is money declared by a government to be legal tender.  It need not derive its value from the government demanding it in payment of taxes or insisting it should be accepted within the national jurisdiction in settlement of debt. Instead the defining property of fiat money is that it has no intrinsic value and derives any value it has only from the shared belief by a sufficient number of economic actors that it has that value.

If true, that would be a change to the very top section of this article, at least.

== Common Sense ==
Federal Reserve Notes (FRN's) represent US Obligations, not US wealth.  Currency does not necessarily have to be based on a "Gold" or "Silver" standard.  The evolution of paper and coin currency in America was born of convenience, as individuals would deposit wealth (gold, silver, etc) at a bank for safe keeping.  Banks would offer "Warehouse Receipts" in the sum of the deposit. Individuals would trade the receipts rather than withdrawing their wealth, paying their dues, only to have the recipient of said wealth redeposit the wealth back into the bank.  By definition currency is a substitute for wealth, and required to be backed by a commodity that is universal and liquid.  Federal Reserve Notes are neither, rather they are IOU's to be redeemed against future production. Additionally the Federal Reserve System also keeps reserves of foreign currencies, bonds, and other such assests, none of which are commodities, and are difficult to liquidate.  Most Foreign currencies, bonds, like Federal Reserve Notes are not backed by a commodity thus their value is questioned. 

Franklin Roosevelt, along with the Federal Reserve Bank, stole wealth from US citizens by way of Presidential Executive Order 6102 which outlawed the ownership of gold by private citizens. Essentially this can be looked at as a form of slavery as FRN's are symbolic of debt, not wealth.  The collateral on said debt is the future productivity of the nation, i.e. its citizens. Citizens thus are required to pay the interest of said debt in the form of taxes through labor. After World War I England and most of Europe moved away from the Gold Standard and instead kept reserves of foreign currencies, especially FRN's.  This in part is symbolic of our National Debt.


        Foreign currency and bonds (especially triple A rates govt bonds, like those of France, Germany and the UK) are amongst the most liquid financial assets in the world.
        Furthermore, somebody's debt is someone else's credit, so your assertion that they do not represent wealth doesn't really make any sense.
        Your argument is self defeating, if debt isn't wealth, then a gold backed currency can't work because even when they were payable in gold, US gold
        certificates were simply debt (The US govt owes the bearer such and such an amount, ie it is in debt and promises to pay that debt in gold coin),
        and hence not wealth. You also state most foreign currencies are not backed by a commodity and hence their value is questioned,
        but you don't mention by whom.

== Start again? ==
In general, the Wikipedia articles (gold standard, fiat currency, related ones) need to attribute beliefs to the relevant economic schools of thought.  Many of the statements in the current articles appear to be statements of faith, not fact, and they don't, in general, acknowledge which school of thought they are from.   This BIG problem kind of overwhelms a lot of the little problems.

This article is one of the most biased, propaganda-filled articles on Wikipedia, and should probably be completely re-written. It is full of arguments and rhetorical questions, rather than a simple statement of facts and information. One would hope that the article presents different viewpoints equally, instead of one viewpoint, the opposing viewpoint, and then why the opposing viewpoint is wrong. Information on this articleis controlled by people who feel strongly about one position on the subject, and they are the only ones who bother to write and edit the article. In short: this article is what's wrong with Wikipedia.

:Agreed.  At its worst, Wikipedia serves as just one more place to entrench ideas that "everybody knows" but that no one can source to any satisfactory degree.  A good example is the statement that the historical norm has been the use of commodity-backed currencies.

== Bad start ==
I have several problems with this article but let's just start with the first sentence:

:''Fiat currency or fiat money, is money that is current or legal tender as satisfaction for money debts simply and only by government fiat i.e. by arbitrary order or decree, by nothing more than law.''

# To define ''currency'' in terms of the word "current" is reflexive and therefore not helpful.  
# Not all forms of a fiat money are [[legal tender]].  Legal tender refers to the lawful (i.e. legal) forms of payment (the meaning of the word "tender") in a particular currency.  What constitutes legal tender depends upon (a) the currency, (b) the jurisdiction, (c) what the payment is for, and (d) the amount of the payment.  In some jurisdictions only certain coins of a currency are legal tender for that currency, in others only the bank notes, etc etc.  Not more than a small number of coins can be used in some places, for some things.  So the term "legal tender" is used incorrectly here.
# Again and again in WP we find the assertion that all debts can be satisfied by the payment of "legal tender".  No.    Legal tender is simply a form of a currency which MUST be accepted in discharge of a debt denominated in '''that same''' currency.  If I owe pounds sterling I cannot legally tender (see where the term comes from?) US dollars.  And vice versa.

OK.  I'll stop there, for now.  [[User:Psb777|Paul Beardsell]] 04:15, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I agree with all your points. Fiat Currency is merely currency that is created by a government and is accepted in a community as money proper. The reason for the acceptance may vary from coercion, prohibition of alternatives, superior stability or some other form of superior utility. Fiat Currency is characterised by the fact that it is not redeemable for anything (ie it is not a promisory note). As such it is one form of money proper (there are other forms such as commodity money) and it is not merely a credit substitute. [[User:Terjepetersen|Terjepetersen]] 10:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

== Bad example ==

I find this statement deceiving:

"One recent example was the Argentine bust which followed the unravelling of its “currency board”. Instead of being linked to gold, the peso was linked to the U.S. dollar, which served as the hard money basis. When an economic crisis hit, dollar reserves fled the country, causing the monetary basis to collapse."

How can "dollar reserves flee the country", I think what must have happened is that they were spent.  This hardly seems like a problem with the monetary system, but rather simply a reflection of a collapsed economy.  If you spend all the money, you've spent all the money!  In effect, wouldn't this be a testament to the success of the system, the government was not able to pretend that they hadn't spent all by simply printing more money, ensuring that the money did not inflate?



___________________________________________


Answer to "How can dollar reserves flee the country?"

If a central bank (in this case, Argentina) stands to exchange 1 - 1 with the US dollar, they issue pesos and hold dollars in reserve (to "Back" their currency).

If someone with a lot of pesos doesn't believe that the central bank has enough dollars to back their currency, or believe that the peso is overvalued (which is the same thing) they can engaged in a speculative attack.  Basically, they sell pesos to the central bank and receive dollars.  This drains the reserves in the central bank and often causes a devaluation in the currency.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/74.232.140.88|74.232.140.88]] ([[User talk:74.232.140.88|talk]]) 03:21, 14 February 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== OK, this example is meaningless ==

"A further illustration of the irrelevance of physical convertibility can be seen by supposing that a bank issues two kinds of paper dollars: one redeemable for one ounce of silver throughout the year and another redeemable for the same amount of silver, but only at the end of a year. If the market interest rate is 5%, and if it is costless to issue paper dollars, then the inconvertible dollar must start the year worth about .95 ounces, rise to about .97 ounces at mid-year, and finish the year worth exactly 1 ounce. Any other values would result in arbitrage opportunities. For example, if the inconvertible dollar started the year worth .96 ounces, then each time the bank received .96 ounces of silver in exchange for a newly-issued dollar, it could lend the .96 ounces at 5% interest, be repaid 1.01 ounces at year-end, pay off the paper dollar with 1 ounce, and earn a free lunch of .01 ounces.

What is the value of the convertible dollar? A little reflection will convince the reader that it too must start the year at .95 ounces, reach .97 ounces at mid-year, and finish the year at exactly 1 ounce. That is, the issuing bank must actually raise the amount of silver it will pay for a dollar over the course of the year, or arbitrage opportunities will result. For example, suppose that at the start of the year, customers can deposit .95 ounces and get one paper dollar in exchange — a physically convertible dollar that can be returned to the bank for .95 ounces if the customer desires. If that dollar remained at .95 ounces over the whole year, then at the end of the year the bank will have received a free lunch of .05 ounces — a free lunch that will attract rival bankers willing to pay 5% interest to the holders of their dollars."


How can any logic be derived from this example without specifying how the notes are issued to start with?  They don't just get issued, they get sold, but at what price?  How much silver is paid for these two notes to start with?  Obviously at the begining of the year, one would pay the bank a full ounce for the note that is convertible (back to 1 ounce), but only .95 ounces for the one that wasn't!  This example is therefore bogus.

I agree, I am going to remove those two paragraphs as it is more confusing (and erroneous I believe) than it is informative over what I see is something quite simple. A physically convertible currency is affected by the interest rate of the specie or commodity that is backing it. And by the way, no one knows what the actual interest rate for anything will be for the year. That would be the same thing as predicting the future. Also, a 5% interest rate would not increase 0.95 to 1; it would increase to 0.9975. 5% interest would raise 1 to 1.05.--[[User:Acefox|Acefox]] 00:10, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Currency as a brand ==

I've wondered for a long time why people are willing to accept a currency that is not physically convertible. And "financially convertible" sounds to me too much like "bootstrapping", which is worrysome to me as a mathematician.

So I recently discovered some important fact of the media / ad industry, namely that adverts  often promote something other than the owner of the relevant trademark. For example, shop owners will seldom put up a sign saying "Ice cold softdrinks available here". Instead they'd rather put up a "Coca-cola" sign, giving "Coca-cola" free media exposure.

Now many ads include prices e.g. "Coca-cola now only $1". Therefore currencies gets free media exposure almost everywhere you look. My guess is that this media exposure is of the order of a hundred of billion of dollars every year (based on global adspend). This means that the dollar is the largest brand to ever exist. It also means the [[brand equity]] of the dollar rivals the value of the gold backing the dollar.

== NPOV/ factual accuracy ==

I put the warning due to this:
:The importance of financial convertibility can be seen by imagining that people in a community one day find themselves with more paper currency than they wish to hold — for example, when the Christmas shopping season has ended. If the dollar is physically convertible (for one ounce of silver, let us suppose), people will return the unwanted dollars to the bank in exchange for silver, but the bank could head off this demand for silver by selling some of its own bonds to the public in exchange for its own paper dollars. For example, if the community has $100 of unwanted paper money, and if people intend to redeem the unwanted $100 for silver at the bank, the bank could simply sell $100 worth of bonds or other assets in exchange for $100 of its own paper dollars. This will soak up the unwanted paper and head off peoples’ desire to redeem the $100 for silver.

:Thus, by conducting this type of open market operation — selling bonds when there is excess currency and buying bonds when there is too little — the bank can maintain the value of the dollar at one ounce of silver without ever redeeming any paper dollars for silver. In fact, this is essentially what all modern central banks do, and the fact that their currencies might be physically inconvertible is made irrelevant by the maintenance of financial convertibility. Note that financial convertibility cannot be maintained unless the bank has sufficient assets to back the currency it has issued. Thus, it is an illusion that any physically inconvertible currency is necessarily also unbacked.
It doesn't make any sense and seems to assert as fact that whether or not there is a gold standard "doesn't really matter".  In the example, what is going on?  The customers deposited silver for a warehouse receipt entitling them to silver. Now, how does issuing bonds head off the run?  The bank still has to pay those bonds with interest, despite doing nothing to increase its reserves.  The passage would imply that I can start a storage facility for some asset, then pocket the asset for myself, and nobody would mind.  If someone doesn't clarify what this passage is saying, I'm going to have to delete it. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 16:26, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
:Let me state right off that I have little familiarity with monetary theory, so feel free to ignore me.  However the example seems fairly clear to me.  The issuing of bonds in the example has nothing to do with heading off a run, but offering "financial convertability" as an alternative to "physical convertitibility".  The bank pays the interest owed with the interest paid on loans (not in example).  It works for money and not other assets because it is not the actual "thing" (gold, silver, etc) that is desired in the case of money, but its purchasing power. --[[User:T. Mazzei|T.

::I understand that the passage is explaining the relative importance of physical or financial convertibility, but it quite clearly ''does'' have to do with heading off a run.  Like it says right here: "If the dollar is physically convertible (for one ounce of silver, let us suppose), people will return the unwanted dollars to the bank in exchange for silver, but the '''bank could head off this demand for silver''' by selling some of its own bonds to the public in exchange for its own paper dollars."  Nor will the incoming loan money cover it, because the incoming loan money is already allocated to pre-existing obligations.  The passage implies I can start e.g. a gold warehouse, issue receipts, steal the gold, and then keep issuing bonds to get new gold receipts to get people to go away.

I wrote the section on physical vs. financial convertibility (sproulmike@yahoo.com). Everyone agrees about physical convertibility--one dollar can be redeemed for one ounce. Financial convertibility seems to be misunderstood. It only means that a bank stands ready to use its bonds to buy back the dollars it has issued. For example, if the Fed believes there is too much cash in the hands of the public (usually evidenced by a low federal funds rate), it will sell bonds, thus soaking up the excess dollars. The importance of financial convertibility is to correct the common misconception that if a currency is not physically convertible, it is unbacked. A currency can in fact be physically inconvertible but still backed by the bank's assets, and the more diligent the bank is in maintaining financial convertibility, the less physical convertibility matters. 

This is, as you said, similar to the real bills doctrine. There is a further discussion in a UCLA working paper entitled "There's No Such Thing as Fiat Money". I forget the number, but that's why we have google.
:Mike Sproul, you're the one I remembered from elsewhere claiming this.  From what you've said, it sounds like original research.  We'll need something better than a working paper to support this.  At the very least, it needs to remove the references to bonds, which merely confuse the issue.  I can see what it's saying about the money still being "backed", but that has nothing to do with the possibility of selling bonds.
:Anyway, I still see a difference in btw, financial and physical convertibility.  Let's say a bank takes 100 silver ounces and issues 100 notes entitling the user to an ounce of silver.  You say that if the bank adds a house to its assets, worth 10,000 silver ounces (say), it can issue 10,000 more notes, without affecting the financial convertibility or value of the notes.  That's wrong.  If one day the real estate market crashed, and the house becomes worth only 5,000 silver ounces, there are notes outstanding that stake a claim to 10,100 ounces of silver, while the bank only has 5,100 silver ounces' worth of assets.  Oops.  Now how does the bank get out of this? [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 18:14, 16 November 2006 (UTC)


=== My suggestion ===

Okay, I'm going to take a stab at rewriting this section to say what I *think* was meant and without being POV or adding unnecessary suppositions.  Here goes...

----
::A distinction should be made between the differt kinds of convertibility:
:::'''Physical convertibility''': A dollar can be redeemed at the issuing bank for a set amount of silver.
:::'''Financial convertibility''': A dollar can be traded somewhere on the market (not necessarily the issuing bank) for assets equal in value to the dollar's quotal share of the issuing bank's assets.
::In practice, if a bank maintains financial convertibility, no one will ever care about physical convertibility because they can already trade the dollar on the market for the same amount that a physical conversion would yield.  It is possible to maintain financial convertibility without physical convertibility, which is seen in the following example: Assume a bank issues 100 dollars and maintains assets of 100 ounces of silver.  Assume then that dollar holders find that merchants demand more than one dollar for an ounce of silver.  In this case, the bank can sell its own silver at market prices until silver ounces trade for one dollar.  The fact that the bank will not, on demand, redeem notes thus does not keep the notes from maintaining a value of one ounce of silver.  In practice, this is how central banks maintain the value of their currencies, through such "open market operations".

While banks can mantain the value of the currency with "open market operations" almost making physical convertability redundent.  Requiring them to allow physcial convertability forces them not to endlessly inflate the money supply. [[User:Geoffsmith82|Geoffsmith82]] 01:41, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
:What does that have to do with what I posted?

Financial convertibility means that a dollar is redeemable for a dollar's worth of stuff at the issuing bank--not that it is just acceptable in the market. If the bank didn't maintain financial convertibility then the money would lose value in the market. I don't think ths rewrite is an improvement. ''(Preceding unsigned comment by 67.49.42.239 aka Mike Sproul)''
:Okay, first of all, and I know I should have said this before, but "a dollar is redeemable for a dollar's worth of stuff" is tautological.  A dollar will ''always'' be redeemable, anywhere, for a dollar's worth of assets, because ''that is what it means for an asset to be worth a dollar''.  And that is why I thought it meant the dollar's quotal share of assets. Second, the whole point of distinguishing financial convertibility (which you added) was that it does *not* need to be redeemable at the issuing bank on demand, in order to have value on the market. That's the whole point of the example.  Make sense. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 00:10, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

If a dollar is issued by a bank in exchange for a bond worth a dollar, then if that dollar is no longer wanted by the public, that dollar can be returned to the bank in exchange for a bond worth one dollar. That dollar is financially convertible. If the dollar cannot be returned to the bank for a bond worth one dollar, then the dollar is financially inconvertible. Obviously a dollar will buy a dollar's worth of stuff on the market, but that is not what financial convertibility means. For example, if the bank wants to maintain the value of a dollar at one ounce of silver, then if it sees the value of the dollar starting to fall, it can sell a dollar's worth of bonds for paper dollars, thus soaking up the unwanted dollar and keeping the dollar equal to one ounce. Thus, by conducting ordinary open market operations, the issuing bank can make physical convertibility unnecessary. ''(Preceding unsigned comment by 67.49.42.239 aka Mike Sproul)''
:Do you see, though, how my complaint about the tautology affects this?  The bank could publicly destroy all of its assets.  Then the dollars (we assume) are worthless. And surprise surprise, a dollar will get you nothing at the bank -- a dollar's worth of assets.  Is this what you mean by "maintaining financial convertibility"? Basically, having a recursive definition confuses the issue.[[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 02:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

It is tautological to say "a dollar is worth a dollar", but not to say "a dollar is worth an ounce of silver". Saying that the bank uses financial convertibility to maintain the dollar at one ounce is equivalent to saying that the bank uses open market operations to maintain the dollar at one ounce. In conducting those open market operations, the bank is continually exchanging paper dollars for a dollar's worth of bonds, but that does not mean the value of the dollar is indeterminate; it remains at one ounce. If, as you say, the bank threw away its assets, then of course the dollar would lose its value. A dollar would be worth zero ounces, though a dollar would also still be worth a dollar. (This seems to be what GeoffSmith was getting at above.)
BTW: Are you adding my name to these posts on purpose? It's no big deal, but if I were worried about my privacy it might be. I assume you go by "MrVoluntarist" because you also don't want your name displayed.
:Okay, I think you and I are saying the same thing, but you're unnecessarily adding a lot of suppositions.  The point of the example, I thought, was to show that the bank could maintain the value of its currency even if it fully suspends convertibility, and merely buys and sells at its pleasure.  I agreed with you that when the bank conducts open market operations, it is buying/selling its dollars at ''whatever'' it can get, i.e., the market price.  But since you agree with me that it's preferable to refer to "a dollar is worth an ounce of silver" as opposed to "a dollar is worth a dollar", I don't understand why you keep wanting to refer to "a dollar's worth of assets" in the definition.  If there are 100 notes and 100 ounces, and it's possible for the bank to maintain a market price of 1 note per ounce, the probper way to describe that would be to say that "the note can be traded for assets equal in value to the dollar's '''quotal share''' of the bank's assets.  (i.e., if there are a hundred dollars, each dollar's quotal share is one hundredth)  And that's why I already have in my rewrite. Further, I don't like how you suppose that the assets are bonds.  Since the bonds themselves are claims on future dollars, that adds another recursive step that makes it harder for the reader to understand what's going on. So that's why I replaced bonds with silver in the example, referred to financial convertibility as a ''market'' (rather than bank) condition, and referred to a dollar's "quotal share" of asset value, instead of being, tautologically, "worth a dollar".  Now, what part do you object to?  It seems you're in agreement.

Real banks back their dollars with "a dollars' worth" of assets, so in the interest of realism I listed the assets partly as silver and partly as dollar-denominated bonds. The trick about dollar-denominated assets is that they present the possibility of inflationary feedback: Let's say the bank is robbed of some of its silver, and the dollars fall in value as a result. But now the dollar-denominated bonds fall too, which leads to a further fall in the value of the dollar, etc. This can be described algebraically as follows: Let E=the exchange value of the dollar (oz./$), and suppose the bank has issued 300 paper dollars, worth E oz. each, and backs those dollars with 100 oz of silver, plus bonds worth $200. Since assets must equal liabilities, we get 100+200E=300E, which yields E=1 oz./$. But if, as above, the bank is robbed of 50 oz., this becomes 50+200E=300E, or E=.5 oz./$. Note that if the bank had held 300 oz as its assets, the same loss would have yielded E=250/300. 

As for bonds being denominated in future dollars, it is a simple matter to suppose that the bank holds bonds that promise $220 in 1 year. At 10% interest the bonds are worth $200 today. I know some people worry about what happens if there aren't enough dollars to pay the interest in dollars, but any rational lender would accept his interest payment in silver or something else.''(Preceding unsigned comment by 67.49.42.239 aka Mike Sproul)''
:I see your point, but I still think it's confusing to list bonds as assets in the initial example like that for the reasons above related to recursion.  If it's important to mention how claims on future dollars can themselves provide real backing for dollars, I recommend adding to the example I gave rather than changing it.  Once the reader understands how the silver is backing the dollars, then go on and introduce how claims on future dollars can count as assets.  It's just a matter of avoiding confusion on a notoriously confusing issue.  Also, do you have any objection to my explanation of the dollar's values as being equal to a quotal share of the bank's assets; or to saying that financial convertibility doesn't require the bank to redeem on demand? [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 18:53, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

Looking back at the article, it does not directly mention the "dollars' worth" problem. I'm open to suggestions, but my first reaction is that this would just take the discussion too far afield. Since, as you say, this is a notoriously confusing issue, maybe some discussion is warranted, but that's why wikipedia has this discussion page. As for the quotal share point: First, the phrase is so rarely used as to be nearly Greek to the average reader. Second, it glosses over the inflationary feedback problem. I'm fine with saying that financial convertibility doesn't require the bank to redeem (for silver) on demand. It is, however, wrong to say that financial convertibility means that a dollar can be redeemed somewhere other than the issuing bank. The defining characteristic of a financially convertible currency is that it can be redeemed for a dollar's worth of assets AT the issuing bank. Put another way: it is the issuing bank that conducts open-market operations, not the general public.

:In the order of your responses: The article ''does'' mention the "dollars' worth" problem -- it's in the very definition of "financial convertibility" currently given that led to my complaint to begin with!  Second, I don't think "quotal share" is confusing, as it can be inferred from content.  Even if not, that would mean using a different term like "dollar's proportional share", or define "quotal share" in a footnote.  I don't see how it glosses over the inflationary feedback problem -- the dollar's quotal share is exactly what your formula says the dollar's value will be. On the issue of redemption, I think it's apparent now there is a problem with the two definitions: in the first one (physical), "can be redeemed" means "can be redeemed on demand" (I know, I know, with the obvious caveats about bank hours, size of redemptions, and time waiting in line).  In the second one (financial), "can be redeemed" means "the bank can buy its dollars back at its pleasure".  And note that I didn't say the dollar can be ''redeemed'' on the market; I said the dollar can be ''traded'' on the market.  There's a reason I used those words: because I was claiming that financial convertibility simply means that the prevailing ''market price'' is such that the dollar buys on the market, something of the same value as its quotal share of the bank's assets.  But then, now you've confused me: are you saying that under your definition of financial convertibility, the bank redeems notes ''on demand'' in some form of assets?  Because that would mean US dollars are not financially convertible, because the Fed picks and chooses who may sell dollars to it.  Furthermore, it would make no sense to talk about a bank "maintaining financial convertibility" after refusing to redeem anything. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 02:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

As long as quotal share means what the formula says, I don't have a problem with it. Normally financial convertibility is exercised at the bank's option. The bank sees the value of the dollar dropping and so it sells bonds. But two things occur to me: 1) In principle, physical convertibility could also be at the bank's option, and (2) If people borrowed money from the bank, and they chose when to pay it back, then financial convertibility is at the customer's option. You're correct that if a bank refuses financial convertibility, then the value of the dollar would drop--to the discounted present value of the expected eventual payoff--which might be zero.

wikipedia is full of comunists

Quotal share means nothing, and is easily the most confusing pair of words on this page. 'Quotal' does not appear in dictionaries, and is apparently some kind of neologistic wiki-jargon. The phrase 'open market operations', on the other hand, has a well known meaning, with respect to central (currency-issuing) banks. Open market bond sales are the mechanism by which the Fed maintains its target interest rates, by draining the financial system of excess reserves which would otherwise be lent out at lower rates.

I agree with Daddy32 that when the price of something is stated, use the ratio of goods it's denominating. Also, in terms of issuing bonds to 'back' the currency - the only reason a bank would do this is because its reserve ratio is less than 100% and it uses its goodwill with customers to make up the difference. If the example is under 100% reserve, the person returning the fiat notes would just be selling his silver in return for a bond. If the bank issued notes at 1 note=1 oz silver, and issued 100, the person who didn't want 1 note would give it back, and that 1 oz silver would go back to him. Then, he could buy a bond at whatever rate for 1 oz of silver, and the bank would have to find a way to make a return higher than the yield. Under a 100% reserve system these two operations would be completely separate, which the reserve ratio could be determined by an audit. If the bank does not have physical possession of what is backing the notes, then the bank has counterfitted. The bond operation would have to back its products with something other than the reserve of the bank, because all that money is spoken for.

:The worse problem is not lack of citations, but the fact that this section is mostly irrelevent to the article. We need a discussion of the difference between fiat money and credit money (which is given in the previous section). Basically credit money is the type issued by banks (as banknotes), and fiat money is where a governent backs the notes of a bunch of national central banks, insures their debt with the additional power of the government to collect taxes from the population by force, and declares it will accept these notes as payments of debts to the government, and all its citizens are required to do this also. <p> However, the next section which follows is a bunch of Marxist and anti-Marxist rants about whether or not this extra layer of government guarantee is a good thing or not (Marxists, who love government, apparently think it is). But whether these things are "good" or not, or even most of the ''debate'' about whether they are "good" is outside the scope of this article. Summarize shortly and put it in the article on Marxist economic theory, or something. We don't need the whole debate. The types of money are what they are, and nothing but a pointer needs to go to other article(s) debating on the utility or "trueness" or helpfulness or goodness of each of them. <p> [And by the way, if credit money is a giant hoax perpetrated by capitalists, then show me the Marxist or Communist State which isn't glad to get credit from the rest of the world. If they can't get it, and their fiat money is worthless (see Cuba) it's only because they have tended to be theives about investment from other countries, and now nobody trusts them.

Neither this nor most of the rest of the section is written by anybody who is interested in the gold standard. This section is rather an argument about the relative goodness of fiat money vs. credit money (i.e., the last being a sort of representative money backed by '''private''' promise of repayment in goods and services, rather than '''government''' promise of the same). The idea being argued (advanced and refuted) is that this nasty "new" credit money is part of the global capitalist plot. How dare individuals or businesses dare to issue their own promisory notes!  Unmentioned is that this was the way it was always done, before central banking. ''Fiat money'' is the later development, so credit money can hardly be said to be part of the some modern Marx-prophesied movement of the world toward global capitalism, in latter days.

== Use of language ==

1) Try sticking to common language usage when explaining something.  "Quotal", if it is a word, is very rare.  If you must use it, define it or link it.

2) Talking about '1 dollar = 1 oz silver' can be confusing in a theoretical example, because silver really has been used as a commodity.  Try dumbing down the GDP/productivity guarantee to something like '50 cows and 500 sheep', so each of the 100 dollars is 'worth' 0.5 cow + 5 sheep (BTW, this neatly leads to a discussion of specie exchange rates, where 1 cow = 10 sheep) -- [[User:72.1.212.20|72.1.212.20]] 21:41, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

== Chopped this out ==

I chopped the following text out of the article, it seems to be more appropriate in a general history of currency, rather than this article which focuses on fiat currency:


Historically, the names of the individual coins and the names of the unit of account were identical, e.g. a [[shilling]] was both a type of coin and a unit of account. The law would therefore recognize tender of those coins as legal satisfaction for debts denominated in that unit of account. Different-mass coins of the same metal could explicitly be recognized as being legally valued at fixed multiples of each other in their names (e.g. in the case of the [[crown (British coin)|crown]] and [[half-crown]]) or simply by reference to their legal masses (e.g. the legal mass of a [[florin (British coin)|florin]] is twice that of a [[shilling]]). A government could legislate for the minting of a system of metallic currency, including the fineness of the metal and the legal and original masses of the coins, without legislating for legal tender or legal values of the coins themselves — they can be discovered or implied by the ratios of legal masses of fine metal in each species of coin.

Coins of different metals naturally resist incorporation into a common unit of account, and therefore of a common legal tender value system. Governments have historically attempted to fix the legal values of different metallic coins to create a unified unit of account and standard of legal tender for payments large and small. Two mechanisms have been used in this connection: multi-metalism and token coinage. The former took the form of bimetallism, where both gold and silver coins were given legal values in terms of each other. e.g. gold coin was legally valued by nominal mass at 15 times silver coin. As market forces changed the actual value of gold in relation to silver, one coin would become overvalued in reference to the other.  For example, suppose there were two coins, a shilling being 6 [[gram]]s of fine silver, and a sovereign being 8 grams of fine gold. If the unit of account were the shilling, then the legal value of a sovereign would be 20 shillings, and a debtor could discharge a debt of 100 shillings with five sovereign coins or 100 shilling coins, at his option. Debtors will nearly always choose the cheapest way to discharge their debts, and this results in the constant threat of demonetization of a legally over-valued metal. Token coinage adopts the coins of the higher value metal as the monetary standard, and limits the lower value metal coins to fractional currency. This is done by deliberately over-valuing the legal tender value of the lower value metal coins and limiting the total amount for which they can be legal tender in any one payment. For example in 1816 the English silver currency was lightened by 6% and the limit of the legal tender of 40 shillings per payment was imposed. Such token currency is clearly fiat currency, as it is only by government fiat that the coin can be received at its legal value.

Over time multi-metallism was replaced by gold mono-metalism, via composite standards where gold coin was unlimited legal tender and silver and copper coins were lightened, limited and converted into tokens.   

Bank notes as legal tender by government fiat originate from the advent of [[central banking]]. Central banks are banks of issue that are owned, sponsored or favoured by the government. Bank notes are negotiable instruments, being promissory notes issued by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. Central banks are generally favoured with monopoly rights to issue bank notes, and/or for these notes to have the status of legal tender. Alternatively, currency notes can be issued directly by the government or its non-bank agencies, and/or the government can favour selected commercial banks by making their notes legal tender (as in [[Hong Kong]]). It is important to note that paper money and fiat currency are not the same. For example, [[Pound Scots|Scottish commercial banknotes]] act as money, but are not legal tender and therefore not fiat currency.

== Removed from Lead ==

The whole lead seems overloaded and much of this is addressed elsewhere in the article.

Without government demand for certain kinds of paper as [[legal tender]], such as bank notes, only [[specie]] is unlimited legal tender. However this is not universally true, as some currencies, (notably [[Pound sterling|sterling]] issued by [[Scotland|Scottish]] banks<ref>http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/faqs.htm#15</ref>), are not legal tender but are accepted by longstanding confidence (Scotland technically has no note of legal tender and thus no fiat money-- see [[Pound Scots]]).

A bank of issue whose notes enjoy legal tender status by government fiat can use its own notes, making their redemption in specie optional — a matter of the 'monetary policy' of the bank in question. Historically, the institution of fiat currency has preceded and enabled the demonetisation of specie, via a monetary policy decision not to offer payment in specie at par, e.g. by suspension, devaluation or redemption in [[bullion]] or foreign currency instead. Eventually this leads to no form of payment, redemption or exchange whatsoever being offered by the issuer and a system of freely floating national currencies, none of which is "redeemable" by fixed amounts of specie or any given commodity.

== My understanding is that the "fiat" requires a law, aka government mandate ==
The article now says that fiat money can be issued on authority of a bank, without the government having an opinion. I don't think that's right. The last is "credit money", an important concept in itself. Fiat money is a SUBSET of credit money, in which the government has become creditor(lender)-of-last-resort. In otherwords, it's the government's credit, not the bank's alone. These things should be carefully spelled out here. Fiat currency appeared in the US only during the American Civil War, in the form of greenbacks, backed by US bonds. Before that, in the period between failures of the US bank (back to Jackson) all paper currency was banknotes from state or private banks and was  credit money only.

== Error in lead section ==

{{quote|During this period the Swiss dinar was endorsed by no central authority or government (in fact it was a disendorsed currency) and was not redeemable by any issuing agent, or backed by any commodity. Its persistent and sustained market value derived purely from its utility as a culturally accepted [[medium of exchange]].

::I've added a paragraph to the lead using this excellent example.

With a government losing power, and in fact behaving irresponsibly money-wise, an old credit money can retain buying power better than a (new) inflating fiat money. The only thing that matters, is whose credit is good. Here's a good example which can be used to show the difference. The [[Pound Scots]] is also a good example of credit money which has strong enough backing that no "fiat" is necessary.

<!--In a [[market economy]], individuals should ideally make decisions based on the tradeoff between desires, particularly the tradeoff between having a good, service or license, and having the [[liquidity]] of money. -->

Fiat money is typically backed by the good faith of the government maintaining or backing the money supply, importantly faith that it will accept the fiat currency in payment of taxes. For example the Federal Reserve banks of the United States maintain that US currency is backed by all the goods and services in the US economy. <Ref>http://www.treasury.gov/education/faq/currency/legal-tender.html#q2</ref>. Hence, the [[credibility]] of the government's policy would, in theory, impact the decisions of consumers and producers in a [[market economy]]. Under this assumption, economic actors might make decisions they would otherwise not make for fear that the currency or money that they hold will change in value radically. Managing this risk could produce economic distortions: when people convert money to other forms, increasing the demand for goods to be hoarded. Economic actors might also shelter income in other, more stable currencies or charge higher interest rates.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} 

Under a fiat money system, money ceases to be a commodity like others, and begins to have special and peculiar properties. Instead of focusing on production, investment and consumption, economic actors begin to attempt to divine the actions of government. Since actors can have foreknowledge of government actions in a way they cannot have of a market, this could lead to efforts to bribe, control or curry favor with the entities holding fiat power.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Fiat money is also closely tied to government borrowing for expenditures that do not have a clear social return, or which may have negative expectations, such as wars of conquest.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Governments could pay for wars using fiat money, rather than in hard currency or specie, on the belief that the returns of war will be sufficient to pay promised notes, and that during wartime shortage and austerity, goods are not available in any case. This has seldom proven to be the case in the absence of strong inflationary controls. Instead, the usual cycle is for the value of fiat notes to trade at a significant discount to portable and stable forms of exchange, specifically those that will be tender regardless of the winning side in the conflict. A variation on this was the use of fiat [[occupation currency]] to place the burden on other areas.

Fiat money is also associated with attempts to control trade{{Fact|date=January 2008}}: If individuals possess notes which are not redeemable outside of the control of a government, the idea is that they will have to purchase preferentially within the boundaries of the nation, rather than importing; ''see [[Protectionism]]''. It was [[David Hume]] who first argued that this merely leads to inflation by the [[quantity theory of money]], even if the money is backed by specie.

Another aspect of fiat money is its relation to property rights.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Many economists{{Who|date=January 2008}} argue that since a government that has control over its territory can requisition, confiscate or otherwise ban the use of specie within its boundaries, or suspend promise payments — as has often happened in the past{{Fact|date=January 2008}} — the presence of fiat manipulation of money is seen as being a signal that a government is intent on abrogating property rights for other purposes. 

The opposing view{{Who|date=January 2008}} is that governments do not immediately intend to confiscate or ban the use of specie within its boundaries, nor reduce the property rights of its citizens. Instead, a government may be oblivious to the root cause of [[hyperinflation]] (excessive increase in the money supply). Worse still, a government may be aware of the cause, but choose to ignore the problem as it is not one that will come to light in its current political term.

Some political economists{{Who|date=January 2008}} argue that there is no such thing as fiat money, that governments can create fiat currency, but that the amount of money is determined by the valuation of the market place, and that attempts to create fiat currency beyond the demand for money generate inflation. In the words of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]], “Money doesn’t matter,” meaning that control of the money supply beyond limited boundaries will be adjusted for in the marketplace; ''see [[IS/LM model]]''.

The idea that there is no such thing as fiat money is also consistent with the [[real bills doctrine]]. In this view, all paper and credit money is backed by the assets of the entity that issued it — usually by the gold and bonds of the central bank or the tax collecting ability of the government that issued it. Since all modern central banks do in fact maintain assets as collateral against the money they issue, one has to ask why these assets are universally held if, as quantity theorists claim, they are irrelevant to the value of the central bank’s money.

I've moved the section above out of the article and into discussion here pending its clean up. One or two citation flags might be permissible but the whole section is peppered with them and in this state it does a disservice to the rest of the article.

Bear in mind that this is a controversial subject over which widely differing views are held. Wikipedia requires citation for any material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged. Your safest bet here is to assume that material that does not include a source will be challenged and hence removed.

Think about the suitability of your sources too. For example, a website that profits from trading precious metals may have vested interests and, consequently, a particular view of the subject. Such source doesn't necessarily mean it can't be referred to at all, but it should at least require [[Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Need_to_qualify_sources|further qualification]].

I've left the section originally entitled "Credit-based monetary systems, where feedback mechanisms prevent Fiat money" in the main article for the moment, though its title is now shortened to simply "Feedback in credit-based monetary systems". As with the above it could also do with some references, but I haven't challenged it just now.

There are also the closing paragraphs in the "Convertibility" section. Again, I'll get to that later if someone else doesn't fix it first.

::I have tried to make a more relevant section, but I am not confident enough to make the edit:

'''Geographical range of use'''

Fiat money is used as the main system of payment by almost every government on earth{{fact|reason=Jan 2008}}. Given that the system must be backed by a government, the fiat money will normally lose it's value if no functioning government is in place to guarantee the ascribed value. However this is not always the case, the so-called [[Swiss dinar]] continued to retain value as a type of credit money in Kurdish Iraq, as a result of backing by private banks and acceptance from individuals there, even after its fiat-money status was officially completely withdrawn by the backing government (the central government of Iraq).<ref>{{cite web | author=Budget and Finance  | title=Iraq Currency Exchange | url=http://www.cpa-iraq.org/budget/IraqCurrencyExchange.html | publisher=The Coalition Provisional Authority | date=2003 <!--| accessdate=2008-03-19-->}}</ref>

In areas where no government is present, such as [[failed state]]s, or where government policies have caused [[hyperinflation]] the official monetary system is often abandoned and [[barter]] or foreign currencies are used.

A large economy may function on credit money which is not fiat money, such as United States paper currency during periods prior to 1913. 

A mixed case where a credit money note is only partly backed by the full credit of the government involves [[Banknotes of the pound sterling]]. Although only those pound sterling notes issued by the Bank of England are directly backed by government credit and thus technically "legal tender," the pound sterling banknotes issued by certain other authorized banks in the U.K. still function equally as money in the U.K. This is because there is an indirect mechanism of government backing where these other banks are required by law to have a sum of money in an account in the Bank of England equal to the total sum of sterling notes they have issued. <ref>{{cite web | author=Bank Of England  | title=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/other_notes.htm | url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/other_notes.htm | publisher=The Bank Of England | date=2008 <!--| accessdate=2008-03-19-->}}</ref>

Yes, I can see from the citation that he is an academic/economist at the University of California, but can we do better than that?  We don't tend to cite individuals by name unless they are personally notable - a good guide is "is their an article about them"?  In this case there isn't.

Just because a note is not [[representative money]] (backed by specie or a very specific aount of some good), does NOT mean it's fiat money. A simple note of credit on the bank (a banknote) can be redeemed for anything else the bank owns. For example, if the bank owns a house from a mortgage foreclosure from failure to pay, then the bank will be perfectly willing to give you the house in exchange for its banknotes. Thus, they are (in effect) backed by the houses the bank owns, and so on. It's not gold-backed money, but it's still a goods-backed money. So it's a sort of representative money, except what it represents is not specified. A certain claim on the bank's assets as they are a generic, is what it is.

==Jerome Daly==
[http://www.restoretherepublic.org/?p=58 This site is nonsense.] It claims that the case was never legally be overturned, nor can it be. Well, the Supreme Court of Minnesota thought differently, and held the attorney Jerome Daly in contempt for ignoring a superior court's order staying the absurd ruling from this '''Justice of Peace''' Mahoney (who was not even a licensed attorney):

::"Although the stay order of Justice Peterson was served on the justice of the peace and Mr. Daly on July 11, 1969, they intentionally and deliberately disregarded it in this way: On July 14, 1969, the justice of the peace, upon motion of Mr. Daly, entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order for judgment in favor of Zurn. In response to our order of August 12, 1969, directing the justice of the peace and Mr. Daly to show cause why they should not be held in constructive contempt of the Supreme Court of Minnesota for this conduct, Mr. Daly appeared personally in his own behalf before this court on August 21. He advised the court that he had been authorized to represent the justice of the peace in the proceedings. After noting that he was making a special appearance, Mr. Daly, an attorney at law admitted to practice in this state, acknowledged that both he and the justice of the peace intentionally violated the order of Justice Peterson because in their opinion neither this court nor Justice Peterson had jurisdiction to issue it.
::"Although the death of the justice of the peace on August 22, 1969, has rendered the proceedings as against him moot, it is our judgment that the conduct of Jerome Daly was contumacious. It is the order of this court that he be temporarily suspended from the practice of law in the courts of this state effective October 1, 1969.
::...
::"(6) We are satisfied from the record that the justice of the peace acted upon the advice and at the instance of attorney Jerome Daly. Mr. Mahoney was not admitted to practice as a lawyer. An attorney who intentionally and deliberately advises and encourages a justice of the peace or any other person to disregard an order of the Minnesota Supreme Court is guilty of contempt."

::::::"Applications for a writ of prohibition in the above-entitled, consolidated matters instituted before Martin V. Mahoney, justice of the peace of Credit River Township, Scott County, Minnesota. The death of Mr. Mahoney on August 22, 1969, makes these proceedings moot as to him. However, to avoid the necessity of further proceedings to vacate and set aside any action taken herein by Mr. Mahoney prior to his death, (see 42 Am.Jur., Prohibition, s 47) we declare all proceedings in this matter before the justice of the peace a nullity upon the jurisdictional grounds set forth in In re Daly, Minn., 171 N.W.2d 818."

For what it's worth, this same Jerome Daly had other, more serious problems as well. See ''United States v. Daly'', 481 F.2d 28, 73-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9574 (8th Cir.) (''per curiam''), ''cert. denied'', 414 U.S. 1064, 94 S. Ct. 571 (1973). Daly was convicted of willfully failing to file federal income tax returns for the years 1967 and 1968. In rejecting his appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit noted: "Defendant's fourth contention involves his seemingly incessant attack against the federal reserve and monetary system of the United States. His apparent thesis is that the only 'Legal Tender Dollars' are those which contain a mixture of gold and silver and that only those dollars may be constitutionally taxed. This contention is clearly frivolous." Id. Regarding Daly's disbarment in Minnesota, see also ''In re Daly'', 291 Minn. 488, 189 N.W.2d 176 (1971) (''per curiam'').

== Logical fallacy in the "criticism" section should be removed. ==

The last sentence in the following excerpt from the "criticism" section should be removed. <blockquote>
The Austrian School of Economics has long held that no sound economy can long endure under fiat money, with prominent Austrian Economist Ludwig von Mises arguing in this book Human Action that, "What is needed for a sound expansion of production is additional capital goods, not money or fiduciary media. The credit boom is built on the sands of banknotes and deposits. It must collapse."  However, the Austrian School is outside the mainstream of contemporary economics.[14]
</blockquote> The last sentence above creates the logical fallacy of ''argumentum ad populum'' (Latin: "appeal to the people"), in logic, is a fallacious argument that concludes a proposition to be true because many or all people believe it; it alleges that "If many believe so, it is so." The criticism is stated, and then the second sentence characterizes the criticism as a minority view, which engages in the fallacy just listed. This is the "criticism" section, not the "criticism of the criticism" section. The language is also biased. If the criticism of the criticism should stand in this section, the cliche "outside the mainstream", which has a negative connotation, should be re-worded to eliminate bias. I've looked through Wikipedia articles with "criticism" sections, and I cannot find a similar biasedly written criticism of a criticism. You certainly won't find it on the entries "Capitalism" or "Marxism". It should not be here.[[Special:Contributions/76.105.195.53|76.105.195.53]] ([[User talk:76.105.195.53|talk]]) 01:54, 5 March 2009 (UTC) Also, the reference for the second sentence links to the opinion paper written by one assistant professor. This is an opinion paper, not a scientific study. The assistant professor even states his bias in his opinion paper: <blockquote>
Needless to say, I have many friends who think more highly of Austrian economics than I do.
</blockquote>One person's opinion does not an idea outside of the mainstream make.[[Special:Contributions/76.105.195.53|76.105.195.53]] ([[User talk:76.105.195.53|talk]]) 02:01, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia's criteria of notability and verifiability are really two different things.

==general problems with article==
WP articles should not be so technical as to be unintelligible to the Average Reader, nor should they be subtly biased so as to support one school of thought over another school. 

I think this article falls on its face in both respects. One is easier to see than the other, though. There is much detailed analysis about the history of various sorts of money (fiat money, credit money, specie money, tax backed money, ...), but the effect, as with so much economic writing is more fog than clarity. WP articles should be better written and more understandable than that. Even in a field as bestrewn with arcane experts and expertise, much of it mutually exclusionary. Someone who understand the field and its jargon and who can write clearly is badly needed. 

ON the second point, there is a sense (to this reader at least) that the underlying approach of the article is discussion of a dodgy business, this fiat money. One which is fraught with problems and fraud. Regrettably, this leaves unsaid that currency manipulation is known to have predated by a long time the invention of fiat money by the Chinese (if it was they who did so -- the article is not clear on that point just now -- a poor writing issue). Currency debasement was an issue early on in Anatolia if some of the Greek sources I dimly remember can be trusted, and it was certainly so recurrently throughout the history that we have not lost. A better account then would start with the clear statement that no fully satisfactory practical method of managing currency (and so a money supply. Indeed there is no mention here of the concept of a money supply and the necessity of some rough parity between the size of an economy and the size of its money supply). 

All methods tried to date have had considerable troubles in actual practice. Layered on top of this patchy and dodgy experience is a bramble patch of theoretical analysis schools, each declaiming with solemn authority (backed by abstruse and exhaustive (well certainly exhausting) analysis) which purports to show, from first principles in each case, that this or that way of managing currency is the only sensible one. Thet they are mutually exclusive in most respects, seems not to affect the importance accorded to the economists and analysts who intone solemnly and portentously. Practical operators, who are devoted to one or another school, predictably those which benefit their interests, have demonstrated that they are unable to operate sensibly in practical applications, much less theoretical analysis. 

If both practical (however implicitly including some theoretical perspective) and formally theoretical approaches are dubious as ways of judging this or that approach to currency structure, this should be reflected in this article and its parallel articles. It is not. And all this is the other hurdle this article trips over and so fails to reach any sort of satisfactory finish line.  

Not being in the field, nor a sufficiently extraordinary writer, I can't myself fix this. Some editor surely is in a postion to do so. Please, take a whack at it. I don't think it can be really a lot worse, so the downside risk is low.

:: I've added a bit to the opening paragraph. A fiat money, as a legal tender for all debts, is basically backed by any good or service in the country's economy which is for sale, and incurs a debt. All moneys need "backing", and "fiat money" is simply money which is backed by anything in the economy which is bought or sold. Including specie. What's the difficulty in understanding that? Whether it's a good idea is something else again, but in practice it works as well as anything else. It seems a bit silly to have the entirely world economy backed by "gold" or something, since what can you do with gold? Didn't you ever see that great Serling Twilight Zone where the robbers make off with gold bars and wind up (after cryogenic suspension) in a desert of the future where they have all the gold they can carry, but little water? This causes the "value" of gold to fluctuate wildly. Then we find out that gold in the future is worthless anyway, since it can be synthesized? It's a nice little exercise.

::: Saying it's backed by "any good..." is not true. If you accept paper money today, who is to say what you will receive for it tomorrow ? Just ask Eddie Cross who contributed 40 odd years to a pension fund and when he received the cheque it wasn't enough to fill up his car. In the case of Zimbabwe the central bank was not independent. Even if the central bank is independent, the currency can still loose significant purchasing power (even after interest income) because the central bank will not have the access to the correct financial instruments to hedge against inflation. -- [[User:Nroets|Nic Roets]] ([[User talk:Nroets|talk]]) 23:39, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
:::: That's the central bank's fault, then! Adjusting the money supply so that it tracks the amount of goods and services in a economy is not rocket science: see [[core inflation]] and [[consumer price index]]. If goverments refuse to do this, out of greed or corruption, then there are bad consequences. But requiring some odd money standard to keep politicians from printing money to buy votes with, is not the answer. In practice, corrupt systems find a way around this, no matter what. Historically, the gold standard has had problems even when governments were honest, as the world gold supply sometimes did not keep up with the expansion of the economy and need for money (resulting in deflation and historically the adoption of bimetalism). And in theory the opposite could happen if vast new gold deposits were discovered, or if people lost confidence in gold because it cannot be eaten or lived in. All in all, it's better to trade goods for goods, with no intermediate metal "standard." But since barter is not very convenient, it's often better to keep track with paper. To keep that from being counterfeited, you may make some of it "official." And there you have fiat money. <p> But please remember that fiat money is not the only money, even in societies that have it. Every time you write an IOU or originate a loan, you create a "money." If you buy and sell loans (see various kinds of "credit derivatives"), you're printing your own money. The colapse of modern financial systems is not due to misuse of fiat money, but due to misuse of other instruments as tradable "money" when their backing (AAA ratings, etc.) was far shakier than anything done by "fiat" via the federal reserve system.

::::: Targeting money supply in an open economy is extremely difficult ! Loans denominated in foreign currencies, effects of derivatives etc. Inflation targeting is a bit easier, but the BoE, the SARB and a few others missed their targets recently, despite employing "rocket scientists". Central banks have also made mistakes in the past by e.g. believing in the Phillips curve and not because they were corrupt!. I do agree with you that fiat money is generally a good thing, but words like "generally" and "basically" should be used sparingly in wikipedia. -- [[User:Nroets|Nic Roets]] ([[User talk:Nroets|talk]]) 16:27, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

==Backing==
[[User:Ivanleo]] removed the following statement from the text - 'Federal Reserve Notes receive no backing by anything.'  The statement was taken from the Treasury Department web-page [http://www.treasury.gov/education/faq/currency/legal-tender.html#q2 FAQs: Currency - Legal Tender Status].  I added this statement to the lead.  The reason I did so was because this same page was used to support the statement 'In another sense however, they are "backed" by all the goods and services in the United States economy'.  To use the source to support the second statement without mentioning the first would be to quote the source selectively.  If this source is used, both statements need to be given.  Furthermore, as the article stands, the words 'in another sense' make no sense in the absence of the first statement.  As the first statement has been removed, I will also remove the second. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbiesmith]] ([[User talk:Crosbiesmith|talk]]) 17:11, 14 April 2009 (UTC)

==Fiat money in monetary economics==
[[User:Monoecus]] added the following today:
<blockquote>
In [[monetary economics]], fiat money is an [[intrinsic | intrinsically]] useless good used as a means of payment and a storable object. Whereas cash-in-advance models of money<ref>Clower, Robert W. 1967. "A reconsideration of the microfoundations of monetary theory." Western Economic Journal 6 (December): 1–8.</ref> assume the usage of fiat money to trade goods, fiat money arises endogenously in many micro-founded models of money<ref>[[Nobuhiro Kiyotaki]] and Randall Wright (1989), "On Money as a Medium of Exchange," ''Journal of Political Economy'' 97(4), p[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1832197 p. 927]-54.</ref><ref>Ricardo Lagos and Randall Wright (2005).

</blockquote>

This is not an easy passage to understand.  Monoecus, or others, would it possible to elaborate on the meaning of the following terms please?:
*an intrinsically useless good
*a storable object
*endogenously 
I understand that endogenously means 'within', more or less, but I don't understand what it is that fiat money is endogenous to here.  Thanks - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbiesmith]] ([[User talk:Crosbiesmith|talk]]) 18:32, 17 April 2009 (UTC)

:It probably defies understanding in any way other than subjective opinion splicing of different concepts into a threaded cord of O.R. - Probably better to delete it from the page... as the meaning, if any, is so arcane as to be worthless...(my opinion)- [[User:Skipsievert|skip sievert]] ([[User talk:Skipsievert|talk]]) 22:21, 17 April 2009 (UTC)
::I understand now that 'arises endogenously' means that fiat money arises in the model, rather than being imposed on the model as a pre-condition.  I don't see the point of the clause 'Whereas cash-in-advance models of money assume the usage of fiat money to trade goods'.   As I understand it, a 'cash-in-advance model' imposes the existence of money on the model as a precondition, so the clause is redundant.  I will remove it.  Any elaboration on the other terms used in this passage would still be useful.  Also, are the words 'it makes some trades feasible that would not be feasible without it' supported by any of the sources given here?  It is not clear.  I will add a citiation tag to that part until this is clarified.
:::Having looked at the sources again, I realise this material relates specifically to restricted mathematical modelling.  It is unlikely to be of interest to the general reader.

::::''arises endogenously' means that fiat money arises in the model, rather than being imposed on the model as a pre-condition.''... not sure about this either. It pre- supposes that 'money' is natural..?. or aspects of money arise like a physics question and answer? It still may not make literal sense, but may be a poetic o.r. of money theory. Maybe it can be meant to make sense... but seems like a real stretch. I think it probably could also be removed.

Hi guy's. Just discovered the Discussion here. Let me elaborate a bit. Fiat money is a very important concept in monetary theory, i.e. the economic theory of explaining why money (especially fiat money) exist. Fiat money in this sense is important to be fiat as it stands in contrast to capital for example which has a certain consumption/production value. Hence, this was a first paragraph to put in. There should be of course much more about it. I honestly disagree with some of the comments above that this is a topic to be left out of wikipedia. Monetary theory is a very big and important field and fiat money takes a big stake here. So, this belongs definitely into this article. I will try to make up some more interesting references. As there are certainly more than thousand research articles using the term fiat money, that is a big big thing which was completely missing in the previous article. So, watch out for more. If you have questions, I will come back to this discussion. Cheers.

Regarding the endogeneity, that is a very important point to be mentioned. Fiat money in certain models are imposed by assumption (i.e. cash in advance models) or arise because agents want (!) to use money to maximize their utility. I will elaborate on this better, as soon as I have time.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Monoecus|Monoecus]] ([[User talk:Monoecus|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Monoecus|contribs]]) 05:15, 21 April 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Alan Greenspan ==

I have questions about, "Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Chairman from 1987 to 2006, was '''an early critic''' of fiat money arguing in his essay, Gold and Economic Freedom, that . . ."  Since fiat money has been around and controversial for a long time, how could he have been an ''early'' critic?  Was this wording meant to convey "early in his career. . ." or something else?  Also, isn't a comma needed before "arguing," or am I reading the sentence wrong?  [[Special:Contributions/68.83.72.162|68.83.72.162]] ([[User talk:68.83.72.162|talk]]) 18:45, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

==Value when fiat money loses backing==
This section claims that a 'strong private banking system and consensus of the population' may support the value  of a fiat currency.  This appears to be original research.  Unless a reliable source can be found for this claim I will remove it.  I have checked the provided sources - they do not support this claim. They demonstrate that the Swiss Dinar continued in use despite its loss of backing by the original government.  They do not explain why it continued in use. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbiesmith]] ([[User talk:Crosbiesmith|talk]]) 20:04, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
: Yes. You can remove it. But even after you do, this article will encourage readers to jump to conclusions: 
# Readers may conclude that Fiat money work because of the history and the Brenton-Woods system. ''Except it collapsed !''
# Readers may conclude that Fiat money work because the government specifies that debt can be paid with it. ''Many people (agents) who work with Fiat money are very far removed from this law and not nearly enough [[Initial value problem|rigorous arguments]] are presented to build a bridge between them. Furthermore most countries allows most loan contracts to be written in terms of any other asset, say corn or equities.''
# Readers may conclude that Fiat money work because of it can pay tax with it. ''A lot of Fiat money is being held by people saving for retirement who either do not know how much tax they will have to pay or they know that they will have to pay very little tax. Again that bridge is missing''.

Determining what the purchasing power of a fiat currency will be, seems an ill explored area in economics.

:It appears that there seems enough controversy in defining the term, and citations have been given for various statements of definition and we have agreed on removing at least one of them recently. The tag is not meant to mean that the past editors are not experts at all, but the past history doesn't bear it out, IMHO. I think someone is needed to provide good references as to accepted definitions of the terms, as I found that many citation on the web are simply copying others, often from WP, and the authoritative references may not be easily found online. I have looked with limited time given, so I may be wrong, but the tag might alert and motivate some knowledgeable reader to provide insight, rather than just walk away and dismiss WP as a poor reference.

==Keynes definition==
Keynes defined fiat money as follows:
<blockquote>
''Fiat Money'' is Representative (or token) Money (''i.e'' something the intrinsic value of the material substance of which is divorced from its monetary face value) - now generally made of paper except in the case of small denominations - which is created and issued by the State, but is not convertible by law into anything other than itself, and has no fixed value in terms of an objective standard.

==Criticism==
The current article states "Fiat currency was anathema to American president Andrew Jackson. Jackson went so far as to pass the Specie Circular in 1836, which required all payment for government lands to be in gold or silver coin."  This is unsourced.  I doubt there is a source as fiat money was not at that time in use in the U.S.  The Specie Circular was intended to combat the use of bank-issued credit money, not fiat money.  I will remove these claims shortly. - [[User:Crosbiesmith|Crosbiesmith]] ([[User talk:Crosbiesmith|talk]]) 13:12, 30 December 2009 (UTC)
