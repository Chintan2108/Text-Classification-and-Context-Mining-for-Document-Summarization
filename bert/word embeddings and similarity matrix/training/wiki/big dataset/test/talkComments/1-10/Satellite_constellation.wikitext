The latency numbers quoted 125ms for geostationary satellites is a one-way number (from earth to satellite) 22000/186000. It would be more meaningful to quote the up/down number of 220ms.  Not knowing LEO well I can't comment on the 1-4ms, but that does seem like a very large dispersion from min to max.
