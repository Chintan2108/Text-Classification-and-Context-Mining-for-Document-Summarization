==1930 "start date"==
Doesn't the "1930" "start date" look a bit late in the light of this from the [[BP]] article?

"In May 1901 [[William Knox D'Arcy]] was granted a concession by the [[Shah]] of [[Persia]] to search for oil, which he found in May 1908. This was the first commercially significant find in the [[Middle East]]. In 1909 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was created to exploit this find. The company grew slowly until [[World War I]] when its strategic importance led the British Government to acquire a controlling interest in the company and it became the Royal Navy's chief source of fuel oil during World War I.

"In 1917, the war allowed it to take the British arm of the German Europaische Union, which used the trade name ''British Petroleum''. After the war ended the company, in which the British Government now had a 51% interest, moved to secure outlets in Europe and elsewhere. but its main concern was still Persia, following the [[Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919]] the company continued to trade profitably in that country."

[[User:Robin Patterson|Robin Patterson]] 02:26, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Or this:

In 1905 [[Nestlé]] merged with the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. By the early 1900s, the company was operating factories in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. World War I created new demand for dairy products in the form of government contracts. By the end of the war, Nestlé's production had more than doubled.

Surely the debate should start with colonial nations (primarily Britain and Netherlands) with tea and spice trading and the East India Trading Company, Hudson Bay Trading etc

Does MS belong here? Most of people work in Redmond, Washington, US.

[[User:Pavel Vozenilek|Pavel Vozenilek]] 01:58, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:My understanding is Multinational means offices in multiple countries... those support centers make it a multinational company. [[User:Graniterock|Graniterock]] 00:43, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

:::My understanding is that multinational implies large, formerly independent units in many countries. That MS has localisation and call centers doesn't fit the picture that much. (Someone had also added Google who doesn't have even these, AFAIK.) I think huge steelmakers/car manufacturer/food processors/etc are better examples. [[User:Pavel Vozenilek|Pavel Vozenilek]] 19:42, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::::MS and Google do not just have call centers, they do business in these countries, get sued and sanctioned by the governments of these countries, and follow different laws in every single one of these countries. If that isn't multinational I don't know what is --[[User:Alterego|Alterego]] 19:56, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

:I agree... the act of doing significant business and having a presence in other countries makes it multinational.  I'm still trying to to research the transational thing.  It has to do with not having a cetralized head office.  Microsoft would be multi-national because it is clearly based out of the US.  A transnational company is much more decentralized often purchasing services from contractors rather than owning them directly.  This way, the company is not directly responsible for the contractors - they can cut themselves off and fluidly move into another country rather than having to face the legal rammifications.

DAVID BOWMAN,
EDIT NINJA,
BEHIND YOU

The difference = there isn't any major difference as such.  It is a term which has evolved over time - multinational corporation being the first title and transnational being the more modern name.  This is because corporations now operate transnationally abroad - not just nationally or regionally as competition has become more fierce/widepsread.  So, as the term suggests, as the multinational companies have advanced into markets overseas and worldwide, they have become transnational - rather than just multinational or regional.  Any standard IPE (International Political Economy) textbook will outline this for you.

==Unsubstantiated==
''Avoiding transport cost is not really an incentive because transportation costs, at least on a large scale, are generally relatively cheap relative to the price of the product. Only heavy or large products may need to be produced in the market they are intended to sell in, products such as building materials.''  Ah, no. Try moving liquid oxygen or any other industrial gas across long distances and you'll find that the transport costs are prohibitive. Many chemicals -- very light -- are in the same category. (The comment also isn't sourced.)

''Many MNCs are large in relation to the national income of the countries in which they are located. This means that it is not as easy for the host governments to enforce national laws on MNCs.'' How does a government's failure to enforce its own laws end up in an "ethical issues" section of an article on MNCs? Wouldn't this be better placed in an article on corruption or poor governance?

''In a highly competitive world, companies seek to reduce their costs as much as possible. The prospect of a foreign company setting up in a country where labour is cheap is attractive both for the company and the host country's government.'' Labor is, in very, very many cases, an insignificant portion of total production costs. 

In general, I find this article to be bias against MNCs. [[User:DOR (HK)|DOR (HK)]] ([[User talk:DOR (HK)|talk]]) 08:47, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

==Copyright problems==
This article was listed for evaluation at [[Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2009 April 26]]. The section on "Market imperfections" infringes on the 2000 book ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=mXjeiQYR088C&printsec=frontcover#PPA73,M1 The nature of the transnational firm]'' with a combination of close paraphrase and direct duplication, both comprehensive non-literal similarity and fragmented literal similarity. For example, compare the text in our article: "If there are unique assets of value overseas, why not sell or rent these assets to local entrepreneurs, who could then combine them with local factors of production at lower costs than those experienced by foreign direct investors?" with the source: "'''If''' a firm has some '''unique assets of value overseas, why not sell or rent those assets to local entrepreneurs, who could then combine them with local factors of production at lower costs than those experienced by foreign direct investors?'''" (emphasis added) The duplication continues, with the next sentence (for example) copied verbatim. While the source is cited, we cannot duplicate text from other sources or closely paraphrase them to comply with our [[WP:C|copyright policy]] (see also [[Wikipedia:CFAQ#Can_I_add_something_to_Wikipedia_that_I_got_from_somewhere_else.3F|the copyright FAQ]]). Duplicated text used under [[fair use]] must comply with our [[WP:NFC|non-free content guidelines]], which sets out those ''limited'' circumstances under which text may be duplicated verbatim and requires that duplicated text be properly noted with quotation marks. Given the extensiveness of duplication here, the entire section will need to be removed or revised, unless [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials|permission to use it can be verified]].

== Multinational vs Transnational? ==

I have to verify this - but I have been lead to beleive that a Multinational company is what is described on the page with a centrailzed head quarters.  A transnational company has no "head office" and move whatever base of operations it has fluidly between its national offices.

If this ends up being correct should I create a new article and disable the redirects?  Or am I better to just make a note of it within the page itself?

Thanks! - Graniterock

I agree, multinationals and transnationals differ. Multinationals may operate as subsets of our transnational organization. I say this as Mathematics, consistent with logic and the biosphere, oriented as world citizen, updating the definitions of if and money as a sub-activity of my masters degree thesis in Mathematics at Simon Fraser University, thereby demonstrating local = global. Multinational entities, of which I also am one, are subsets of Mathematics + logic + the biosphere updating if + money and reconciling monopoly + ubiquity.

== Page move ==

I note this article has just been moved (to Multi National Corporation (MNC)) without any prior discussion.  Does anyone agree with this?  I certianly don't.  For a start having an acronym embbeded in the title like that is an unlikely search term and goes against [[MOS:NAME]].  secondly "multi" is a prefix, not a word in its own right.  Against that we have a simple assertion that "Multi National Corporation (MNC)" (not even "Multi National Corporation") is the most commonly used term.  I was tempted to simply revert straight way but I'll give people a chance to comment first. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 13:32, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

:It's a very odd move (with an edit summary of "widely recognized name"). Multinational is in most dictionaries now (with an origin from multi-national): the google hits for the double-word version are a mix of "Multi-National" and "Multi National," so it would seem to be that multi national is the older way of spelling it.

== Was Dutch East India Company the first multinational? ==

I believe this article (http://www.bartleby.com/65/fu/Fugger.html) proves otherwise.


The Dutch were the first.Not the British.

The answer is neither, and such arguments get nowhere. Like most inventions defined retrospectively, this one developed in stages - a decent article should reflect the complexity and simply show the development of the idea of a multinational company and not state which was 'first'. The British EIC was founded two years earlier than the VOC. If there is some technical/legalistic reason some academic has defined the terms so that the VOC qualified by the the British EIC didn't (i.e., the stock, this should be explained - but that doesn't square with the definition given here, so the article's claim is suspect.

:Perhaps the whole part about the Knight's Templar should just be removed, until a conclusion can be made.

Don't assume that because you've thought of something earlier, it's the earliest - there are many candidates out there. If you're going to redefines terms so far as to include the Templars (a bit sensationalist and rather indefensible...), there are a great many more candidates even in the ancient world, many of them - gasp - not Western.

I think the article should not try to state who was first, just as an article on the car/computer/television etc. should not try to establish who was first - not because historians are clueless, but because when things develop in stages the idea of being 'first' overall can be ill-defined (giving patriots of various countries lots to bitch about). Hence the oft-used phrase 'the first modern...' - which is even more iffy. When a conclusion has to be subjective, it is NOT encyclopedic to reach a 'valid' conclusion, whatever that might be here.

: This Dutch/English east indies company stuff should be removed. There were many trading companies that precede them - in England alone, there were the Merchant Staplers, the Merchant Adventurers, the Muscovy Company, the Levant Company, etc.   
* To clarify on the "stock" issue: In the early 1600s, the English EIC only raised enough capital for one journey at a time; after that expedition returned, profits were distributed, ships sold off and investors liquidated; the EIC would then have to start afresh, raise new capital for the next expedition, and so on.  The VOC started off 1602 with a joint stock for multiple expeditions, initially 10 years-worth but then stretched that out permanently.  The EIC only introduced "joint stock", i.e. multiple-journey capital (four-years worth), in 1613.  On that front, the VOC certainly pips EIC as the "first" in the East Indies.  
* If anyone wants to insist that joint stock is not a criteria, than I can list over a half-dozen Dutch companies (''voorcompagnie'') that were formed in 1594-1600 to trade in the east indies, each of which was formed before the EIC, and each of which raised far, far more capital and sent more expeditions to the East Indies than the EIC did (that is, until they were all force-mergered into the VOC in 1602).  
* Contrariy, if anyone wants to insist joint stock is a criteria, then the Muscovy Company (1555) and Levant company (1581) had joint stock well before any of the East Indies companies.

In short, trying to make historical claims for the "first" MNC is a ridiculous endeavor.  Either include a history of all overseas trading companies - which means starting with the Italians & Germans, which precede the Dutch & English - or just delete that paragraph.

== This article has multiple issues ==

Including:  highly POV, copyright infringement (but see below), essay-like, lack of citations

The main part of the article may be disguised advertising for the book cited, or may simply be done by a fan of the author.  How this made it above start class, I don't know.

Any takers for major rewrite?[[User:Sfcardwell|Sfcardwell]] ([[User talk:Sfcardwell|talk]]) 04:43, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

:It looks like this article hasn't been revised much since the "essay" and "POV" tags were added more than 18 months ago.  I am not in a position right now to do a major rewrite, but I can begin the process by removing and rewording the more troubling sections.  From looking at the article as it exists now, there is a large amount of material that probably needs to go.  I don't want to claim ownership of this article, but I would like to strip it back to a basic set of facts from which a properly written article could be extended.  - Authalic 21:41, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

{{quote|text=The article is biased. The positive view of MNEs has found them productive and technologically advanced. Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) show that more productive firms export, while the most productive ones invest abroad. At the theoretical level, Dunning (1981), Markusen (e.g., 1995) and Helpman (1984) refer to firm-specific advantages that parent firms share with their subsidiaries and/or plants. Hymer (1960) originally categorized as owner- or firm-specific advantages access to raw materials, economies of scale, intangible assets, superior management etc. In Dunning’s eclectic paradigm, i.e., the so-called OLI theory (ownership-specific, location-specific and internalization advantages), firm-specific advantages refer particularly to assets such as knowledge capital, which can be easily replicated and transferred within the firm across countries, without incurring high transaction costs or knowledge leakages.  Yet, FDI and trade are important vehicles of international technology diffusion (Keller 2004). 

There is evidence showing that the higher productivity is related to the multinational character of the firms, rather than their foreign-ownership (see e.g., Martin and Criscuolo 2002, Criscuolo and Martin 2009; Griffith et al. 2002 for the UK; Doms and Jensen 1998 for the US; Globerman 1979 for Canada).  Original firm specific advantages that allowed firms to go global in the first place may have been further enhanced by their exposure to fierce international competition, ability to source technologies globally, organize their operations efficiently on the global scale, etc. Moreover, FDI is linked to high-tech industries (Griffith et al. 2002, Blomström and Kokko 2003)

"A transnational corporation (TNC) differs from a traditional MNC in that it does not identify itself with one national home. While traditional MNCs are national companies with foreign subsidiaries,[10] TNCs spread out their operations in many countries sustaining high levels of local responsiveness.[11] An example of a TNC is Nestlé who employ senior executives from many countries and try to make decisions from a global perspective rather than from one centralized headquarters.[12] Another example of a Transnational Corporation is the Royal Dutch Shell corporation whose headquarters may be in The Hague, Netherlands but its registered office and main executive body where the decisions are made is headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Anti-corporate advocates criticize multinational corporations for entering countries that have low human rights or environmental standards.[13] The aggressive use of tax avoidance schemes allows multinational corporations to gain competitive advantages over small and medium-sized enterprises.[14] Organizations such as the Tax Justice Network criticize governments for allowing multinational organizations to escape tax since less money can be spent for public services."
