== Head of state ==

Would anyone object, if I added ''head of state'' to the intro? [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 15:15, 2 November 2018 (UTC)
:Given that it would be consistent with the article's NPOV section on [[Monarchy of Canada#Head of state|Head of state]], it could be an acceptable improvement to the article as a whole, if neatly done. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 15:35, 2 November 2018 (UTC)
::I've added it in. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 15:49, 2 November 2018 (UTC)

:::Do you have any proposals of wording? [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 15:59, 2 November 2018 (UTC)
::::I would leave it out of the lead. It should not be mentioned without explanation, so it is best explained in its own section.

:::I tried to explain my position, I'll try again.

Also, I do not see that mentioning it in the lead provides any information to readers. I asked you for a policy or guideline based reason for including it, you have provided none.

==Independence and parliamentary supremency==

From the perspective of the rest of the world, the most important thing for Canadians to note is that they require immigrants to swear loyalty to the Queen, before swearing loyalty to Canada. This immediately gives the outside world the impression that Canada considers herself a subject of the Queen of england. 

Common misconception? I think most people recognize that Canada is an independent nation. Maybe a popular [[urban legend]].

:Dunno. It's not the sort of thing that gets whispered from person to person. ("Hey, did you know that Canada's part of Great Britain? And there was this guy who got his kidneys stolen!") From the discussions I've had with foreigners, Americans mostly, I'd call it more of a vague misconception ("I'm not really sure - is Canada part of the UK? How does that thing with the Queen work anyway?") - [[User:Montrealais|Montr&eacute;alais]]

!!!!! Canada is an independent nation and no it is not part of Great Britain. Canada is part of the British Commonwhealth, consisting of former British Colonies. Canada and the United Kingdom though do share the same monarch, but the monarch has very little power in Canada and is largely cermonial. But again, Canada and the United Kingdom are not part of each other, Canada has no more power over the UK than the UK has over Canada. The only ones that can make decesions for Canada are Canadians who elect thier government themselves!!!!!! 

: Canada's constitution requires Canada to have the approval of all the other Commonwealth realms in order to change the line of succession to the throne. The U.K. parliament, on the other hand, suffers from no such impendiment. Thus, Canada makes itself subservient to the U.K. (and all other Commonwealth realms) in a way that the U.K. (or New Zealand, for example) is not subservient to Canada. [[user:Jonathan David Makepeace|Jonathan David Makepeace]]

:: Well, speaking as an American, I can't say I've ever encountered anyone who didn't know that Canada was an independent country.  [[user:soulpatch|soulpatch]]

::: Right, but a lot of people are unsure of just how independent it is. - [[User:Montrealais|Montr&eacute;alais]]

:::: It seems like there is misconception that "Great Britain" is the name of a country. Britain refers to a country, but Great Britain is the name of an island off the coast of Europe.

::::: It's not a misconception: Great Britain is an island, but is also the political union of England, Wales and Scotland. On the other hand, Britain without the Great is quite an ambiguous term. British citizen means a citizen of the UK, which includes both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles, on the other hand, include the entire island of Ireland. [[User:G Colyer|G Colyer]] 23:42, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: "The U.K. parliament, on the other hand, suffers from no such impendiment." Actually, it does. It requires all the Commonwealth Realms' permission to change the Act of Succession.

::: I suggest that you read the article on parliamentary sovereignty.  The current U.K. parliament can change any law it likes with a simple majority, including the Statute of Westminster, the law allegedly requiring the consent of other Commonwealth realms to change the line of succession.  Ditto for New Zealand. [[User:Jonathan David Makepeace|Jonathan David Makepeace]]

:Johnathan, I wonder how you can correctly state that the Statute of Westminster is law in the U.K., yet also claim the U.K. need not heed certain parts of said Statute.  The U.K. must abide by it's own constitutional laws!

:Certainly the U.K. parliament can alter the Statute.  But, contrary to your claim, as the Statute is now part of constitutional law in *all* the other Realms, so can Canada.  Still, it would be illogical to do so unless some drastic act or circumstance forced the Canadian parliament(s) to perform such changes.  Otherwise, the Realms abide by the convention laid out in the preamble to the Statute, and do not alter the Statute, because they recognise that the Monarchy does not wholly belong to any one perticular Realm.  On the symbolic side this represents the cooperative relationship between the Realms who share one Crown, and on the practical side it avoids a divided Crown with two members of the same royal family acting as Sovereigns of multiple kingdoms.

:However, a shared Crown does not impede Canada's status as a completely independent country.  It is the Canadian Constitution which creates Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada, and it is only the people of Canada, through their governments, who can alter that situation.  Since the patriation of the Constitution in 1982, Canada has been a seperate and independent kingdom which just happens to share its monarch with 15 other countries.  [[gbambino]]

::The Statute of Westminster is law in the U.K. but could be superceded by a normal act of parliament.  Parliamentary supremacy is the bedrock of Britain's unwritten constitution.  They don't need Canadian permission to change the order of succession.  It's as easy to do with Canadian permission as without.

::The only Canadian court to pronounce on the matter has ruled that the Canadian constitution requires that Canada have the same monarch as Britain.  I disagree with their legal reasoning, but we both agree that the Canadian parliament is incapable of doing what Britain's parliament can do, i.e., unilaterally change the order of succession.  Please read the "One Crown or Several?" section of the article.  Canada would have to amend its constitution (itself an act of the British parliament) to unilaterally change the order of succession.  The British parliament, acting at the request of the Canadian government and all the majority English-speaking provinces but not Quebec, made this very difficult by requiring that each and every Canadian province approve a constitutional change touching their monarchy.  [[User:Jonathan David Makepeace|Jonathan David Makepeace]]

:As per the preamble to the Constitution Act 1867, Canada's constitution is similar to that of the U.K.  Therefore, is Parliamentary Supremacy not also a major aspect of Canada's government(s)?  As well, you've disregarded what I said previously about the fact that, as both the Act of Settlement and the Statute of Westminster are now parts of Canadian constitutional law, Canada ''can'' alter the Statute, or even the line of succession, without the permission of the other Realms.  Certainly it would be easier, due to the nature of Britain's constitution, for the UK Parliament to make such changes, but Canada could definitely do it as well.

:However, the convention that is laid out in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, that which says one Realm wishing to alter the line of succession must seek the approval of all the other Realms, is a fundamental one to maintaining a single Crown operating equally in each of the 16 Realms.  It is this convention which Rouleau refers to in his ruling when he speaks about the Canadian Constitution stipulating that Canada must have the same monarch as the UK.  He even goes further to make clear that the Canadian Constitution, in the same manner, stipulates that Canada must have the same monarch as not only the UK, but ''all'' the Commonwealth Realms: "To [alter the line of succession] would make the constitutional principle of Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries unworkable..."  Basically, he's saying that the Canadian governments (not the courts) have the legal ability to alter Canada's line of succession, but it would counter the conventions created by the preambles to both the Constitution Act 1867 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, and would cause the one Crown to become fractured, thereby creating serious problems with something that is "necessary to the proper functioning of our constitutional monarchy."

:If the UK were to alter the Act of Settlement, and therefore their line of succession, the same problems and issues would arise.  The UK would have one monarch, while the Canadian constitution would give Canada a different monarch.  Just because Britain alters their line does not mean Canada's alters by default. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 16:13, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==NAFTA, Sovereignty, Salaries==
So, I added this bit about the passage of [[NAFTA]], which I don't have a reference for except my Canadian friend, who confirmed the veracity of this with several friends of his. If someone knows otherwise, I'd be interested to read about it. [[User:Graft|Graft]]

Soverignty is the same for Canada, as for England and Australia, i.e."The Queen in parliament"

I removed the following line. 
''and the removal of an unnecessary expense for the Canadian taxpayer''. 

The suggestion that monarchy is more expensive than republics is actually a myth. Britain's monarchy, for example, costs the average British taxpayer 79p per year. The Irish presidency costs the Irish taxpayer ?1.50, the Italian presidency costs the Italian taxpayer ?1.23 while the Spanish monarchy costs the average Spaniard ?0.45. Additional costs (upkeep of palaces, etc) would, in the event of Britain becoming a republic, remain exactly the same. The only difference is that instead of being described in one line of the state ledger, they would be moved to another, moving from the category of 'monarchy' to 'maintence of historic buildings', which would still be used as most of them are, now, as museums and for state functions. Most of the practical cost of the monarchy goes in wages and in fact is balanced by state income from a royal Duchy which belongs to the monarch but is given to the state, for a yearly civil list payment in return. I think the British government actually makes a profit of approximately £1 billion on the deal, and lawyers have argued that in the event of the abolition of the monarchy, the duchy would become the personal property of Elizabeth Windsor. Of the British Royal Family, only two are actually in receipt of state salaries, the Queen and Prince Philip, via the Civil List. The Prince of Wales is financed totally by the Duchy of Lancaster, a large body of lands run by the Prince of Wales' office. (Charles is currently renovating and upgrading his new London residence, Clarence House at a cost of millions, none of it from the taxpayer. If Britain was a republic, the cost of maintaining that eighteenth century building would fall on the taxpayer. Similarly Queen Elizabeth never actually wanted to ''live'' in Buckingham Palace but instead in Sandringham (where she as the owner would pay all the bills!) and commute to London. But the Government said 'no' and insisted she live there, turning down her other choice, the smaller, cheaper Clarence House.) All other royals are paid by the Queen out of her finances, with the taxpayer being paid back any salary cost involved in the Princess Royal, Duke of York, Earl of Wessex, Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Duke and Duchess of Kent, meaning in effect that they and the large number of engagements they carry out come 'free' as part of the package. 

In Canada's case, becoming a republic would involve a lot of ''additional'' expenditure. Presidents tend to require political advisors, involve costs with state visits, involve major expenditure on former governor-general's residences to upgrade them to full international head of state's palace standard; when Ireland created a presidency, millions had to be spent on the former governor-general's residence, the Viceregal Lodge, to turn it into ''Áras an Uachtaráin'', the presidential palace. In fact the original plan was to demolish the Lodge completely because it was not thought large enough and adequate enough, and build a new presidential palace in the grounds. But with the outbreak of World War II put a hold on the plan. In the end the old building was converted at considerable expense to provide large reception rooms for hosting state banquets, meeting the diplomatic corp, etc. It ''still'' is regularly criticised as being ''inadequate'' as a presidential residence, with Dublin Castle having to be used for many state functions. So the development costs of a 'President of Canada', the costs of residences and the day to day costs of running their offices would far far exceed anything currently paid for the governor-generalship and monarchy. 

That isn't to say Canada should ''not'' become a republic, merely that cost is a pretty weak argument, because the cost of having a republic will far exceed by cost of the monarchy, possibly by a factor of three. [[User:Jtdirl|STÓD/ÉÍRE]] 19:15 Apr 7, 2003 (UTC)

:Regardless of whether or not you think it is a good argument, it is an argument that is made by people in that context, and therefore should be included. If pro-monarchists argue as you do, state that. - [[User:Montrealais|Montr&eacute;alais]]

:Canada's governor general already carries out all of the duties of the head of state, including all of the diplomatic functions. The only function the Queen does in relation to Canada is appoint the governor general. Besides, it's hard to imagine a Canadian president getting away with spending money as loosely as the current governor general has!  [[User:Jonathan David Makepeace|Jonathan David Makepeace]]

==Senate appointments==
About the [[NAFTA]] stuff, does anybody have any other reference?  I ask for two reasons: one, I'm not sure about it being the Queen rather than the [[Governor-General of Canada|Governor-General]] who acted on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and secondly, my recollection (which I haven't researched to verify yet) is that it was more than two Senators, something like 6-8?  I'll try to verify in the next couple of days. - [[User:Cafemusique|Cafemusique]] 12:23 Apr 26, 2003 (UTC)
:OK...found corroboration that it was eight Senators.  Also, the Constitution requires the Gov-Gen to advise the Queen in that case, instead of the PM.  I tried to make that clear, without losing the fact that it was the PM who was the instigating force. - [[User:Cafemusique|Cafemusique]] 12:55 (UTC)

::I'm pretty sure the Senate was expanded to pass the GST not NAFTA.  The Liberals conceeded Free Trade after losing the 88 election. [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] 18:08 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:::Poked around, does seem to have been done to pass the Goods and Services Tax, although I'm not sure that NAFTA wasn't a bonus. This bit from [http://www.freedomparty.org/consent/cons9709.htm this link]:
::::''Using permission from the Queen and a previously unused constitutional clause P.M. Mulroney appoints another 8 Senators, this ensures the passage of the GST in the Senate (1990)''
:::[[User:Graft|Graft]] 19:27 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:::I am assured by several Canadians that NAFTA was indeed on Mulroney's mind when he stacked the senate. Still seeking written confirmation... [[User:Graft|Graft]] 22:49 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:::: From the Canadian encyclopedia: "In 1990 the Liberal dominated Senate effectively blocked plans of the Conservative government to pass the legislation for the unpopular GST. This led PM Brian Mulroney to use his power to add 8 senators in order to ensure passage of the legislation in 1990."  The FTA was passed in 1988 and NAFTA was passed in 1993, neither had the enlarged senate at the time of thier passing.  I'm afraid your Canadian friends  might be misremembering. [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] 00:15 3 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I'm a Canadian and I can tell you that the government never used the 8 senators to pass the NAFTA agreement, the conservative government at the time used that crap power to pass the GST Tax, on another note, that is what caused the once largest majority government in Canadian history, to fall to just two seats in the next election. Ah, democracy works. 

==King-Dominion-Kingdom==
Is it correct to say that, just as the United Kingdom is a kingdom, so also is Canada a kingdom?  Or should one say that only when the monarch is male?  [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] 00:50 22 May 2003 (UTC)

No. Male or female, a state with a monarch is a kingdom. And yes Canada could be called a kingdom. [[User:Jtdirl|FearÉIREANN]] 22:15 29 May 2003 (UTC)

:Canada was originally supposed to be called the Kingdom of Canada, but this was changed to Dominion (which itself was eventually dropped) to avoid irritating the Americans. - [[User:Montrealais|Montr&eacute;alais]]

::As an American, I cannot understand the assertion that the name matters to Americans one way or the other. I defer, however, to those more familiar with the motives of those who chose the name. --[[User:Habap|Habap]] 15:11, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::It was 1867.  The French had recently imposed a puppet monarchy in Mexico, and there was lingering hostility toward Britain in the U.S. as Britain was perceived as having favoured the Confederacy in the U.S. Civil War.  While not explicitly hostile to Canadian Confederation (an unfortunate term to use right after the Confederate States of America had  been defeated), the Monroe Doctrine did not make U.S. Americans well disposed to the cementing of Britain's North American colonies into a viable monarchist entity still tied to the U.K. - [[User:Jonathan David Makepeace|Jonathan David Makepeace]]

:Just wondering, but in what sense does the Canadian monarchy cost the taxpayer ''anything''?  Surely the governor-general can cost no more than a republic head of state would (and, as has been pointed out, almost certainly costs less).  Does the monarch herself impose additional costs on Canada in some manner?  If so, how? [[User:Jlk7e|john]] 22:31 29 May 2003 (UTC)

I don't think so. [[User:Jtdirl|FearÉIREANN]] 22:50 29 May 2003 (UTC)

==Article name==
I switched this page from "Queen of Canada" to "Canadian monarchy" since technically this page is not simply about the "Queen of Canada", Elizabeth II, but about the institution of the Canadian monarchy. [[user:J.J.]]

I moved the page to "Monarchy in Canada" since "Canadian monarchy" is sometimes used by those who argue that there should be an indigenous or resident monarchy in Canada rather than sharing a monarch with other countries. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 18:47, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Also, there are many republicans who argue that there is no "Canadian monarchy" that it's a British institution so the title "Monarchy in Canada" is preferable for Wiki since it's more neutral [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 19:02, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:Just saw the above.  

Canadian monarchy means the Monarchy ''of'' Canada, which is different to the Monarchy ''in'' Canada. Since the 1920s (an imperial conference decision which later formed the basis for both the Royal Titles Act and the Statutes of Westminster) the concept of the singular crown in the Commonwealth has been replaced by multiple crowns, singular monarch. So constitutionally all states in the commonwealth are separate monarchies. The king in the Irish Free State went from being 'King ''in'' Ireland' to 'King ''of'' Ireland', a fundamentally different legal concept. 

The statement that ''there are many republicans who argue that there is no "Canadian monarchy" that it's a British institution so the title "Monarchy in Canada" is preferable for Wiki since it's more neutral'' is comically wrong. There may well be some republicans who believe that but that is irrelevant. This is an encyclopaedia. It has to deal with issues in a way that are (i) neutral, (ii) factually accurate. Just because there are constitutionally illiterate republicans (as indeed no doubt there are constitutionally illiterate monarchists) does not mean we have to reflect their ignorance in our articles.

*A [[2005]] poll by [[Pollara]] garnered the following results:

Do you support or oppose Canada replacing the British Monarch as Canadian Head of State?

Strongly support 31%
Somewhat support 22%
Somewhat oppose 16%
Strongly oppose 17%
Don't know 14%

As you may know, Prince Charles has announced that he is going to marry Camilla Parker Bowles on April 8th. Do you approve or disapprove of his decision?

Approve 25%
Disapprove 14%
Do not care 61%
Don't know 1%

Do you think that the British monarchy as an institution will be stronger, weaker or unaffected by the marriage of Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles?

Stronger 3%
Unaffected 60%
Weaker 23%
Don't know 14%

I couldn't find this poll on the Pollara website or in any online periodical. Until a source is found, I think it's best to keep it here.

== plug for republican group ==

It is stated on the Monarchy in Canada page: "In 2002, Canada's first nationally organized republican movement was established to promote the issue of Canadianizing the head of state and bring the issue into the mainstream. The non-partisan Citizens for a Canadian Republic now has chapters and members across Canada."

The points about the organization being non-partisan and having chapters across Canada is unnecessary.  That information can be given on the already exiting page dedicated exclusively to the Citizens for a Canadian Republic.

Also, to say the group wants to "Canadianize" the head of state also does not belong here, as it is argued by monarchists that Canada's head of state already is Canadian.

The sentence should simply read: "In 2002, Canada's first nationally organized republican movement was established to promote the issue of making the Canadian head of state a president, and bring the issue into the mainstream."

This would make it more similar to the statement about the Monarchist League, which is as follows:

"The monarchist side, represented by the Monarchist League of Canada was formed in 1970 and currently exists as a strong lobby group advocating and promoting the monarchy in Canada."  Additional detail about the organization is given on its own Wikipedia page.  [[gbambino]]

_____

:I'm with Gbambino on this: the reference to "Canadianizing the head of state" is contentious because monarchists view Queen Elizabeth as Canadian. Other info can be safely included in the org's own article, and is not necessary here. [[User:Kevintoronto|Kevintoronto]] 23:46, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

OK, I’ll concede on the “now has chapters and members across Canada” but the description of “non-partisan” should stay – as in “the non-partisan [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]], was established.” This would be fair to counter “The monarchist side, represented by the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] was formed in [[1970]] and currently exists as a strong lobby group advocating and promoting the monarchy in Canada”. Otherwise, I’ll have to insist that it be changed to “The monarchist side, represented by the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] has was formed in [[1970]] and advocates and promotes the monarchy in Canada”, or similar wording of your choice.

Also, I’m not pleased that this phrase keeps finding its way back: “In contrast to [[Australian republicanism]], there is not widespread support for a republic.” For the past 15 years, polls have consistantly shown Canadians’ views split down the middle on the issue. If half of Canadians supporting a republic is not enough to be catagorized as “widespread” then I insist that “support for the monarchy is not widespread in Canada” also be included.

Regarding the word “Canadianize”, its usage is widely used by political experts to refer to the conversion of the Governor General’s office into that of an elected President. One such person is David E. Smith, Professor of Political Studies at the University of Saskatchewan, who’s generally accepted by both monarchists and republicans to be the preeminent academic authority on the monarchy in Canada. He’s written several books and papers on the subject, including The Invisible Crown, which, I should add, was reviewed favourably by the Monarchist League of Canada’s very own [[http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm Richard Toporoski]]. In the May 1999 edition of the public policy magazine Policy Options, Smith writes: “When our own federal government set out in the Bill C-60 Constitutional Amendment Bill, 1978, to Canadianize the office of governor general by codifying its powers and designating its occupant as “the First Canadian,” provincial premiers objected”.

Further entrenching the word’s use as “generally accepted” was the the New Democratic Party of Canada’s Report of the Social Democratic Forum on the Future of Canada "Elements of a Responsive Federalism" which was adopted by the National Convention of the party in August 1999. Note the following: “Recommendation #7: That the New Democratic Party vigorously advocates the revitalization of Canadian democracy through the development and promotion of : Canadianizing the head of state -- Canada should begin to explore the possibility of Canadianizing the head of state. However, this is not a priority for Canadians at this time. We advocate a cautious approach, one that involves, for example, keeping a close eye on Australia as that country undertakes its process of becoming a republic”.

Finally, regarding: “monarchists view Queen Elizabeth as Canadian”, they may in fact. However, they’d be wrong. Various dictionaries all refer to a “Canadian” as: a native or inhabitant of Canada, someone from Canada or a citizen of Canada. The Queen cannot be described as any of these. Even [[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizen/becoming%2Dhowto.html Citizenship and Immigration Canada’s]] own definition cannot be used to apply to the Queen. According to the Citizenship Act 1947, in order to be a Canadian citizen, one “must be a permanent resident of Canada or have lived in Canada for at least three of the four years before applying”. There are no exemptions. In fact, Canada has never even gone so far as to extend “honourary citizenship” to the Queen. So [[Nelson Mandela]], who was granted that honour in 2001, could arguably be classified as “more Canadian” than the Queen.

Monarchists can say what they want, but reality and Canadian legislation dictate that the Queen does not pass any of the requirements for status as either “Canadian”, “a Canadian” or “a Canadian citizen.” 

So the bottom line with this issue is; what is Wikipedia really for, to educate or propagate fairy tales? [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]]

"“non-partisan” should stay"

: I don't have a problem with adding non-partisan. I think that's a fair comment.

"Otherwise, I’ll have to insist that it be changed to “The monarchist side, represented by the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] has was formed in [[1970]] and advocates and promotes the monarchy in Canada”" 

: I prefer your wording. The reference to a "strong" lobhby gropup doesn't belong in the article.

As far as "Canadianize" goes, since that word will generate more arguments, and really reflects the POV of anti-monarchists, I think it is best left out. I should have phrased the monarchist argument better: the position of Queen of Canada is a Canadian institution, as opposed to saying the QEII is Canadian. The argument over her citizenship is moot: she is the Sovereign, after all. The UK equivalent of citizenship is "British subject", which HM the Queen is clearly not. You have provided one relevant reference (Smith) on this - the NDP one is not relevant in this context because it reflects the anti-monarchy position - and that is not enough to convince me that we should use a word that will only cause more debate when it is not necessary here.

"there is not widespread support for a republic"

: This could be worded better. The relevant point here is that Canadians generally don't care ''much'' one way or t'other. If asked, Canadians will express an opinion, but this sentence should be re-written to make it clear that, unlike in Australia, the issue of monarchy vs. republic has not attracted wide-spread attention, rather than trying to indicate Canadians' position on the issue because, as you point out, Canadians' views are split.

:For the record, I would be quiet happy to see the monarchy come to an end in Canada and the remaining powers transferred to the Governor General (and not to a president), as long as we can find a non-partisan way of selecting the GG, but this is beside the point. [[User:Kevintoronto|Kevintoronto]] 18:09, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::Non-partizan being used to describe the CCR is fine.  But, if used, I will ammend the sentence about the Monarchist League to include the same thing, as that organization too is non-partizan.

::As for including the word "strong" to describe the MLC, it's accurate when comparing it to the CCR.  The MLC has been around longer, has far more branches in every province across the country, and well over 10,000 members.  CCR has 3 or 4 branches and less than 1000 members.  But, its not important to state on this page.  Perhaps the actual number of branches and members for the MLC can be listed on the MLC page.

::As for the level of republicanism in Canada, I don't think there are any accurate numbers to show just how strong it is.  Opinion polls are just that -- opinion, and are notoriously unreliable.  Simply look at the secion called Recent Polls for examples.  Thus, there is no factual evidence to back up the claim that "half of Canadians" support a republic.

::My opinion on using the term "Canadianize the head of state" stands as stated earlier.

::There is no official document which states undeniably that the Queen is Canadian.  Because she is in the special position of being Sovereign of Canada (and thus above citizenship laws) she cannot be defined so easily as a Canadian citizen.  So, it is certainly only a point of view that the Queen is Canadian, but then its a point of view that she's not.  If you want more on this debate, go here: http://members.boardhost.com/monarchist/msg/14161.html

"But, if used, I will ammend the sentence about the Monarchist League to include the same thing, as that organization too is non-partizan."

--

I'm in complete disagreement. How can an organization founded to "counter moves by Prime Minister Trudeau and his Cabinet to weaken the Monarchy" claim to be non-partisan? These are the words of founder John Aimers - copied from the Monarchist League of Canada's website. In contrast, [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]] makes no negative references to any political party on its website.  [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]]

:The Monarchist League is not associated with any political party.  Being contrary to the moves of a Prime Minister or government does not make one automatically partial to the Loyal Opposition.  The League was against his push to remove the Crown from Canada, no matter what party he was leader of, and there is ''no'' negative reference towards a political party anywhere in League documents.

:If you wanted to use your argument, then the Citizens for a Canadian Republic would be partisan towards the Liberals and against the Conservatives.  The Liberal Martin government is currently trying to minimize the Crown even further (pro-rebublican), while the Conservative party states in its constitution that it will uphold Canada's constitutional monarchy (anti-republican).  [[gbambino]]

::John Aimers was an active member of the Progressive Conservative party for some years after founding the MLC. This militates against the claim of non-partisanship, does it not? [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 01:24, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: But was the change before or after the ascension of Queen Elizabeth II? She would surely have ceased to be a British subject on becoming Queen. Even if the change was before that, it's possible she is not a British citizen. (She may or may not also be a European citizen.) I think (although I can't now find a photo) that Prince Charles was described as British on the legal notice of his intent to marry posted outside Windsor Guildhall. Since he is not the monarch, this is unsurprising, although if the monarch is not a citizen, I wonder what the citizenship implications are for any children born to a reigning monarch whose consort is also not British?

== Recent edits ==

I just wanted to explain recent edits.

1) As Australia, Jamaica and Barbados all still have the Crown as the foundation of their constitutions, they are Commonwealth Realms.

2) The sentence "...it is widely predicted that there may be little real debate on the future of the monarchy in Canada until the current Queen's reign nears its end" is POV as there has been no planning for removing the Crown from Canada near the end of the Queen's reign, or before any other 'deadline', except amongst republicans.  Its been changed to read: "it is widely predicted that there may be little real debate on the monarchy for some time to come."  [[gbambino]]

:I have just edited the 'Debate on the Monarchy' section to again make clear that the Toronto Star is no longer officially pro-republican.

:Also added fact that the MLC is a national group.

:Added that God Save the Queen is now sung only at some official functions, and that the only oath which has had the Queen removed from it is the one taken by federal public servants. [[gbambino]]

== 'Support & Opposition' as "point-counterpoint" ==

Andy L recently reverted an alteration I had made to the 'Support & Opposition' section of the page.  I changed virtually nothing of the arguments themselves, instead only organizing them in a more legible and clear manner.  Andy L felt this was unacceptable, and reverted the changes, stating his reasons for doing so as: "Sorry but this sort of "point -counterpoint" forumula where the article becomes a monarchist/republican dialogue is a) unencyclopedic and b) violates the "neutral voice" necessary in wikipedia."

No matter how the secion is organized, it remains always a "point-counterpoint" dialogue between the monarchist and republican side.  I merely cleaned it up.  If Andy L feels this is a) unencyclopeadic and b) violates the "neutral voice" necessary in Wikipedia, then why is the 'Support & Opposition' section not deleted entirely?

I've put it back to the more organized format, in the meantime. [[gbambino]]

There's a difference between a neutral voice stating both sides and putting things in the voice of each side which is what you've attempted to do twice now. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 21:57, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

gbambino, please see [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], specifically:

:Articles without bias describe debates fairly rather than advocating any side of the debate. 

:The notion of "unbiased writing" that informs Wikipedia's policy is "presenting conflicting views without asserting them."

ie it is fine to present conflicting views which is why it's not necessary to delete the section. However, what you have attempted to do is to rewrite the section into a series of competing assertions of opinion and we do not assert opinions on wikipedia. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 22:16, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:AndyL-- the entire section is a series of "competing assertions," no matter how it is formatted.  I cannot understand how monarchist vs. republican arguments presented in an ordered manner are somehow different to the ''same'' monarchist vs. republican arguments presented in a disarranged manner.

:Throughout the section, as you wish to maintain it, there are words such as "monarchists argue...", "republicans counter...", "monarchists say...", "republicans point out...", etc., etc.  To rearrange the same arguments into point format does not "advocate any side of the debate" at all!  Both sides are still represented fairly and equally-- point/counterpoint, just as it exists now!  The only thing point form alters is the removal of all that extra verbosity and a streamlining of the section for easier reading.  Other than that, the essence of the "Support & Opposition" remains exactly the same.

:If you will not accept a neutral voice speaking in point form, then come up with some better way to organize that secion, because as it sits now it is a thick and disoganized piece of reading. [[gbambino]]

=="Canada is a kingdom"==
I have deleted the reference to Canada being a kingdom because this issue has been discussed at length and resloved at [[Talk:Canada]]. [[User:gbambino]] has decided to try inserting that concept here since he/she did not win the argument on the [[Canada]] article. I don't really want to repeat all of the arguments here again, so I'll be brief. Saying that "Canada is a constitutional monarchy" makes the point clear, and does not get Wikipedia into the questionable territory of making a statement that no other encyclopedia makes. It is so very, very rare to see other sources refer to Canada as a kingdom, that it would make Wikipedia look kind of silly. The issue of the political situation is much better covered by the concept [[constitutional monarchy]], that by [[kingdom]], which includes  unitary states where the king rules by decreee. I think it makes much more sense to lump Canada in with the sort of moarchy they have in the Netherlands, Sweden and Malaysia, than with the non-constitutional kingdoms in Brunei, Swaziland and Saudi Arabia. [[User:Ground Zero|Ground Zero]] 21:38, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:"Winning" an argument neither has, nor had, anything to do with it.  I conceded in the earlier discussion that [[kingdom]] was not necessary as no other pages for kingdoms ([[Netherlands|Holland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], etc.) mentioned the word 'kingdom' unless it was in the official name of the country.

:However, in the months following that discussion, I reflected further on the matter, and felt that '[[constitutional monarchy]]' is a term which many people do not know the meaning of.  Yes, there is a Wikipedia page on 'constitutional monarchy', but adding, in brackets, the word kingdom, with a coresponding link to the Wikipedia page on '[[kingdom]]' would actually help clarify matters.  The idea of a kingdom is far easier for most to understand than constitutional monarchy.

:Certainly, kingdoms include both absolute monarchies (Swaziland, Brunei, Morocco), but also includes constitutional monarchies (the U.K., Belgium, Norway).  Constitutional monarchies can also be fascist (as stated on the [[constitutional monarchy]] page), but this does not deter Wikipedia from attaching the term to Canada.

:Nor would Wikipedia look silly calling Canada what it undoubtedly is -- a kingdom.  The United Kingdom is what it's name says it is -- a kingdom -- but it is also a constitutional monarchy, so why would Canada be any different?  It may indeed be rare to see Canada refered to as a kingdom, as the country has only really been a fully independent kingdom since 1982; but this does not alter the facts.

:Anyhow, seems I've "lost" again.  Time to slither off....  [[gbambino]]

== One Crown or Several? ==

Firstly, [[User:AndyL|AndyL's]] addition of a section called "One Crown or Several?" is a carry over from a debate going on at the [[Talk:Monarchist League of Canada]] page, one which is specifically about the fact that there is '''no''' debate about the Crown in Canada being British.  The only debate about this is [[User:AndyL|AndyL's]].

Secondly, the concept of one Crown operating seperately in each Realm, something not specific to Canada, is already covered on the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] page. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 19:32, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The information is factual, it is a short quotation from a court ruling and is pertinent to the article. The fact that I first cited it in a talk page is immaterial. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 20:42, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:The information is factual, but is of no concequence to the 'British Crown theory'.  In fact, that is only ''your'' theory.

Gbambino, please who live in glass houses.... Deleting a bunch of direct quotations from a court rulings, and then putting "corrections" in the edit summary is abusive. Those were not "corrections". You are just deleting something you don't like or don't think should be in the article, unless you can provide proof the AndyL misquoted the court ruling or fabricated the quotes, but I don't think that is the case. [[User:Ground Zero|Ground Zero]] 20:59, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Please read what I said.  [[User:AndyL]] did not misquote anything.  What he has done is misinterpreted accurate quotes and applied them to an unrelated topic, when both the O'Donohue case is touched upon already in the "Republican Arguments" section, and the one Crown operating in its 16 realms is covered on the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] page.

:If AndyL can't comprehend the structure of the Crown and its relationship to Canada then he should not be questioning it in a Wikipedia article.  He states that there are "different theories" on how the Crown operates, but has failed to provide any but ''his own''!  He has also completely dismissed the Balfour Report, the Statute of Westminster, the Canadian Department of Justice, the words of a constitutional expert, and words from a link provided by Wikipedia about the Statute, as irelevant or false, and has misinterpreted the words of Justice Rouleau and the Royal Titles and Styles Act to suit his own republican POV.

:Wikipedia is a place where facts are made available, not debated publicly.  His denial of the fact that the Crown in Canada is no longer British is a) unfounded, b) a personal matter, and thus c) does not belong here. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:45, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<br>
AndyL: "Seems to me that you have [[tunnel vision]] and are arbitrarily discounting any evidence that contradicts the theoretical pablum you've been fed by the MLC." Andy, I think you should tone down the rhetoric. That doesn't help further this debate. You're starting down the same road that Gbambino is on, heading toward attacking the person, rather than the argument. [[User:Ground Zero|Ground Zero]] 13:11, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Point taken. Let me restate my criticisms in a better way. First of all, I think gbambino is confusing the talk pages with the article itself. In the latter I've quoted a direct source. This cannot be described as "my own theory" since I am neither a justice on the bench of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice nor a Prime Minister of Canada. This is the proof he asks for. Secondly, he gives no citation for his personal theory that the Royal Style and Titles Act is irrelevent or that the words of Justice Rouleau mean something other than their plain meaning. The proper interpretation of the Royal Style and Titles Act, incidentallly, can be seen in St. Laurent's comments which were made during the debate on that very act. Yet, gbambino argues that I have no "justification" despite the sources I cite, but somehow he gives himself the justification to dismiss these factual sources entirely (and does so without any citations) so that his theories, or those of the MLC, can be put forward as "fact". It is our custom on wikipedia to lay out competing facts and allow readers to decide for themselves rather than, as gbambino proposes, to lay out one particular interpretation as "the facts" and remove or censor inconvenient evidence that would support a contrary interpretation. I'm sorry gbambino but the MLC is simply a lobby group, they do not have the final say on constitutional theory regarding the monarchy. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 14:03, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I've provided numerous sources which point out that the Crown in Canada is not British-- ie. other people's actual words on the matter to back me up.  And before you go spouting off about MLC propaganda, I think it's quite clear that the Balfour Report, the Statute of Westminster, the Canadian Department of Justice, and Richard Toporoski are not agents of the MLC.

::I can even go further to provide words from Volume one of the Final Report of the 1988 Constitutional Commission in Australia:

:::"2.138 The disappearance of the British Empire has therefore meant that the Queen is now sovereign of a number of separate countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, amongst others. As the Queen of Australia she holds an entirely distinct and different position from that which she holds as Queen of the United Kingdom or Canada. The separation of these 'Crowns' is underlined by the comments of Gibbs CJ in "Pochi v Macphee" that 'The Allegience which Australians owe to Her Majesty is owed not as British subjects but as subjects of the Queen of Australia'.

:::"2.151 As discussed earlier,112 the sovereignty of the United Kingdom in 1900 referred to the sovereignty of the entire empire of that country. There was in law and in fact no distinct Monarch of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, etc. There was just the one and indivisible sovereign of all parts of the Queen's dominions. When the Queen, as distinct from the Governor-General or a Governor, acted in relation to either the United Kingdom or overseas possessions of the Crown she acted on the advice of ministers of the United Kingdom. The Crown, therefore, was one Imperial Crown. That is no longer the case. The sovereignty of each of the countries that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their Queen is separate and distinct from that of any other country. Whether in domestic or foreign affairs the 'Crown of the United Kingdom' may pursue quite different policies from that of the Crown of Australia. The Queen's advisers are different in each case. The reference to the United Kingdom is therefore a source of confusion and does not reflect the position of the Crown in Australia today."

:::(Authors of the 1988 Constitutional Commission report include the Hon E G Whitlam, AC, QC and the Hon Sir Rupert Hamer, KCMG)

::In addition, if you want the rulings of judges, again in Australia, the Sue v Hill case in the High Court of Australia written by Councillor Julian Leeser (Woollahra Council, NSW), Councillor Leeser correctly observes that:

:::"the (High) Court confirmed that the Queen of Australia does not act as a foreign Queen. One of the main arguments that was raised by Heather Hill was that the Queen of Australia is the same person as the Queen of the United Kingdom (and Northern Ireland). Therefore swearing allegiance to the Queen of Australia was the same as swearing allegiance to the Queen of the UK. This argument was rejected by the Court on the basis that whilst physically it is the same person, Elizabeth II, they are "independent and distinct" legal personalities. This notion is known as the divisibility of the Crown which Justice Gaudron found to be "implicit in the Constitution." [http://www.statusquo.org/republic_dummies/republic_dummies.html 1]

::That these examples are from Australia proves that Canada is not alone in this matter.  The Crown operates distinctly and separately in ''every'' Realm with no supremacy given to the "British Crown."

::Meanwhile, you've provided two 'proofs' and then applied only ''your'' interpretations to them.  You've given no other examples of experts or academics who interpret Rouleau's ruling and the Royal Styles and Titles Act in the same way as you.  Therefore, the only "differing theories" are the majority of legal and constitutional experts vs. you.  Hardly appropriate, I think.  If there really are "differing theories" on the matter I'd accept that there actually is a debate in Canada on this issue, though I'd be seriously shocked to hear of any.--[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 15:32, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

In any case, while your information on Australia is pertinent to an article on the crown in Australia you should be aware that Australian court rulings have no weight in Canada. Can you cite any Canadian court rulings that conflict with Rouleau?[[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 15:57, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"I understand. I would have ascertained facts had there been any evidence there. As you did not note that you were moving the information elsewhere when actually making the alterations, you thereby easily gave the impression that you had simply deleted the words."

Not exactly an apology, is it?  Your evidence is in regards to the Crown's status in Australia, not the Crown's status in Canada. Given that you are arguing the crowns are different it's a bit odd that you'd be saying that the position of the Australian crown is at all germane to that of Canada's.  [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 16:06, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:To say that I am arguing the Crowns are different reveals that you are not paying attention.  I've said all along that there is ''one Crown'' that operates differently within each legal jurisdiction created by the constitutions of each and every Realm, ''including'' the United Kingdom.  The one Crown operates separately and '''equally''' as the Crown in Right of Canada, the Crown in Right of Australia, the Crown in Right of the United Kingdom, etc.  Ages ago I provided passages from the Balfour Report, Richard Toporoski's essays, the Statute of Westminster to back that up.  I've recently given passages from an Australian Constitutional Commission Report, and a ruling of the Australian High Court to show that the situation is indeed the same the other Realms.  If lawyers, judges, constitutional experts and academics agree that the Crown operates separately and equally in every Realm then ''Britain is not given any position of supremacy'' therefore rendering your still almost completely unsubstantiated claim that the Crown is British defunct.  You've been asked numerous times to provide any real evidence of a debate on this matter (outside of this one), for any words from experts or academics to back up your claim that there are "differing theories", and so far nothing has been produced.

:And besides, it's you who's contradicted himself.  You've been arguing that the Crown is simply the "British Crown" everywhere: "The fact that the Queen is British, lives in Britain and spends the vast majority of time there would tend to suggest that the crown is British." "In Australia the crown's Britishness is de facto, in Canada it's de jure."  By now saying that the Crown has a status in Canada separate and different to its status in Australia (and therefore a different status again in the UK) agrees with my point (and that of every constitutional expert I've read) that the Crown is not a purely British institution.--[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 17:02, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The facts are that the only Canadian court ruling on the subject says that Canada is ruled by the British crown while Australian courts have said that there is an Australian crown. That tells me that there is a different legal situation in Canada and Australia and different constitutional interpretations in each country. The Australian ruling, however, tells me nothing about the Canadian situation while the Canadian ruling tells us nothing about the Australian situation. As for Richard Toproski, his views hold no weight in comparison to a Canadian court ruling. Can you cite any Canadian court judgement that contradicts Rouleau on the "British" nature of the Crown? [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 18:49, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:So you now retract your earlier statement that "in Austrlalia the crown's Britishness is defacto."  That is at least a start.  It also means you acknowledge that the Crown operates separately in it's different legal jurisdictions, and thus is not imperial in nature, working as the British Crown in every Realm.  That too is a step forward.  Considering this, plus the point that you ''still'' haven't provided any examples of constitutional theorists or experts who contradict the prevailing "one Crown equally over, but separately in, every Realm" ideology, you should therefore remove any questioning of the "multiple crowns" situation from [[Monarchy in Canada]] and [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]].

:It then comes down to the fact that you interpret, based on the wording of an Ontario judge's ruling and the wording of the Queen's Canadian title, and barring all the other examples I've provided to back up my claims, the branch of the Crown operating in Canada as British.  If you want to claim that republicans argue (though, you're still the only one, so far) that this ruling implies that the Crown in Canada is British, then that point should be added to the "Republican Arguments" section of the article, which already makes reference to the O'Donohue case.  The article [[O’Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2003]] also makes reference to this interpretation. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 19:56, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"So you now retract your earlier statement that "in Austrlalia the crown's Britishness is defacto."  That is at least a start." So this is your twelve step program to becoming a monarchist?

De jure, the Crown in Australia is Australian. Culturally, historically and according to popular perception it remains British. De jure, as I said earlier, the Canadian Crown is British. I believe I said earlier that de facto (though not de jure) the crown in Australia is also British. Obviously, that is a matter of dispute in Australia. Unfortunately, since this a Monarchy in Canada article, the Australian issue is moot. 

Personally, I think the One Crown or Many section is an interesting addition. You seem to think so too based on your ulitmate attempt to keep the section while completely removing the contents. In any case, Rouleau's comments are not "republican" or monarchist, they are simply a rendering on how the crown relates to Canada. I suspect there are a number of monarchists who believe the Crown is British and don't feel the need to kowtow to Canadian nationalism by pretending it isn't. I also suspect that some, perhaps most, republicans don't care if the monarchy is British or Canadian, they just want it gone. I think Rouleau's comments belong in the section they are in, particularly as we have no indication whether Rouleau is  monarchist or republican. His decision is not an "argument" it is a ruling, a legal fact.  The only thing I can determine with certainty is not whether he is a monarchist or republican but that he's a jurist which neither you, Toproski nor Amiers is.[[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 22:55, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I'm sure you do think the section is interesting -- you added it.  However, my 'attempt' to keep the section was not driven by a belief that it should exist.  Rather I state that it doesn't belong here at all because a) the concept of "multiple crowns in one" is not unique to Canada and thus is already covered on the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] article, and b) while Rouleau's ruling is neither republican nor monarchist (I'm not sure who ever said it was), what is republican (by your own admission) is '''your interpretation''' of the ruling, and that is currently all that is in the "One Crown or Several" section.  As a republican interpretation, it therefore belongs in the "Republican Arguments" section.  As well, the differing interpretations of the ruling are mentioned on the [[O’Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2003]] page.  If there really were a debate on the "Britishness" of the Canadian Crown, then it would still belong in the "Debate on the Monarchy" section.  However, your complete failure to provide any words from any knowledgeable sources backing up your claim that there are "differing opinions" on the Crown and its operation shows that there is no debate or differing opinion besides yours!  So far, without proof, it's POV.  And what happens to POV on Wikipedia...? --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 23:39, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"and that is currently all that is in the "One Crown or Several" section. " No, looking at the section, most of it is made up of a direct quotation from Rouleau. As for it being covered in another article, that doesn't diminish its relevence to this article. And I'm still waiting for you to cite a court ruling from this continent. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 00:27, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

BTW, how do you reconicle your argument that the "One Crown or Several" issue is dealth with in an obscure article  [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] and thus doesn't merit repitition with your advocacy of [[Elizabeth II of Canada]] which is redundant of [[Monarchy in Canada]] amongst other articles?[[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 02:34, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I've moved the quotes from Rouleau, and AndyL's interpretation of them, to "Republican arguments."  AndyL did not provide any references to constitutional scholars or academics who counter the common ideology put forward by most constitutional experts that the one Crown operates equally and distinctly in each Realm.  He thus did not supply proof that there is any debate, or "differing opinions" about, the accepted view, aside from his own personal interpretation of Rouleau's ruling and the Royal Styles and Titles Act.  If some republicans use Rouleau's ruling to say the Crown in Canada is British, then that belongs in the "Republican arguments" section.

:And, Andy, I don't have to reconcile anything.  I still believe that there should be an article on the Sovereign separate from the article on the institution.  They may be related, but are actually two separate topics. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 03:20, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Your rearrangement doesn't work as it results in a number of monarchist arguments being made under the heading "republican arguments". [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 03:34, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I'm working in the constraints of what exists now.  I recognize there are monarchist and republican arguments under "republican arguments", and think that the whole section needs reworked and/or retitled.  Remember, I tried to re-organize the section, before someone else had created the seperate "monarchist arguments" and "republican arguments," into clearer point form and was rebuted by you with your resoning being the disorganized points and counterpoints became too point/counterpoint for Wikipedia when organized.  So, that section needs work, but your personal theories on the meaning of the O'Donohue case ruling still do not warrant a seperate section, and belong under 'republican arguments' -- though, even that is stretching it, as so far you're the only republican to openly express any theory that Rouleau's ruling refutes or negates the accepted view of the Crown's structure and operation over and in the Realms. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 05:30, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

And the previous "point - counterpoint" way you tried to reorganize it before was unencylopedic. I'm sorry gbambino, you can't just get rid of a section because you don't like it and the way you've tried to reorganize the article this time doesn't work so since you don't have a solution the status quo should remain. Thanks for trying though (seriously) this was better than your previous attempt to simply remove material you found offensive. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 11:39, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Doesn't work?  Says who?  Oh, right... you.  Get someone else to back you up.  You haven't been able to provide any constitutional experts or scholars who back up your claim that there are "differing theories" on the Crown's operation over and in the Realms, you haven't even provided any proof that Rouleau's ruling has any effect on this theory -- it's all your own conjecture.  So I doubt you'll find anyone to back up your push to express your warped republican POV, in ''its own section'' no less!  Reverting a page again and again to push your POV constitutes vandalism, I think.  

:And, if you don't like the "republican arguments" "monarchist arguments" setup (and I don't either), and it's not getting edited fast enough for you, don't sit there and complain (and use it as justification for your POV section!), try working it out yourself.  I did -- though it wasn't successful (again, according to you) it was at least an attempt. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 13:10, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I didn't say I "didn't like" the republican/monarchist arguments set up, I said your earlier attempt to turn it into a "point counterpoint" format was unencyclopedic and that your edit regarding Rouleau didn't fit the current format. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 13:13, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

"On her 2005 trip to Alberta, the provincial government wished to have the Queen sign a bill into law. This was not done as it is constitutionally impossible, however Rideau Hall also stated it would conflict with the "Canadianization" of Canada's institutions. "

I'm going to tweak the phrasing of these sentences &ndash;
:''Since the creation of New France, there has not been a time when Canada was not a monarchy. Canada is one of the oldest continuing monarchies in the world, first under the kings of France in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and then under the British crown in the 18th and 19th centuries.''
&ndash; not just because of the gushing tone, but because I think it's technically incorrect. As part of New France, Canada was not a monarchy, it was a dependency of a monarchy. Likewise as part of the British Empire, until the constitutional changes of 1927-1931, Canada wasn't a kingdom, it was the possession of a kingdom. Hopefully that distinction's clear &ndash; just because Sir Bedivere is a knight, and Sir Bedivere owns a swallow, doesn't mean that the swallow is also a knight.

As an American interested in Canada's constitutional monarchy (and an affinity for Canadian history in general), I find that this section is woefully inadequate and not detailed enough, compared to the republican section which is much longer. I believe that this subject (Canadian monarchists and their positions and arguments and so forth) justifies a new article, which hopefully will present a clear account of what Canadian monarchists are all about, and keeping any potential Canadian republican bias out of that article (and presenting republican views and arguments in their article).

If the section isn't longer enough I don't see how you can argue it can be turned into a new article. Perhaps focus on strengthening the section first.

Yes, there's an objection as there doesn't seem to be a pre-existing dispute that requires mediation [[User:AndyL|AndyL]]04:20, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

== Content Proposal for mediation ==

Since it may be blurry what exactly requires mediation, I propose adding the following summary (with some minor rewording for presentation) to the article.  This is material which has been discussed at [[Talk:Monarchist League of Canada]], but would be more appropriate in this article than in that one. Unless, of course, people feel some other question would be better suited to mediator input. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 13:42, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
===Suitability of mediation===
So *first* we bring in a mediator, *then* we thrash around looking for something to dispute? This sounds a bit like going to court before the crime has been committed. Given that there's a backlog of mediation cases perhaps rather than waste a mediator's time we should actually a) propose changes to the article b) see if there's any disagreement c) see if that disagreement can be worked out through discussion d) strike an RFC and/or ask other editors to come in with their opinions e) and then if that fails put in a request for mediation. 

To have a mediator before there's a dispute or worse, try to create a dispute in order to justify having a mediator strikes me as a) premature and b) an abuse of the mediation process. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]]
*So people continuing to work out their disagreements while waiting for mediation is a bad idea? The process alone may possibly be responsible for ending bad faith behaviour.  Plus mediation is a pre-requisite for <s>mediation</s>arbitration.  [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 03:52, 12 July 2005 (UTC) 

"So people continuing to work out their disagreements while waiting for mediation is a bad idea?"
No, that's not what I said. Asking for mediation before there's even a dispute is a bad idea.

"Plus mediation is a pre-requisite for mediation."
Whatever you meant to say I think you've inadvertently hit on my point. You're trying to get mediation before the prerequisites have been met. That's why they're '''pre'''requisites and not requisites (if there is such a word:) )[[User:AndyL|AndyL]]04:19, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

:I wonder why AndyL is so afraid of another, hopefully unbiased, party stepping into these debates-- he's fought the proposal since it was first raised weeks ago.  [[Wikipedia:Mediation]] states: "This system is meant to resolve disputes."

I wouldn't have a problem with mediation if there was something to mediate. To ask for mediation and then troll around looking for a dispute sounds rather silly to me. As far as I can tell the dispute was resolved with Peter's proposal for a compromise a few weeks ago. Gbambino, as far as I can determine, just wants to have some deus ex machina come in and hold his hand because he's peeved at losing the [[Elizabeth II of Canada]] vote and over getting no support for his arbitration request. That doesn't strike me as a sufficient reason to have mediation. Peter wants mediation over debates on Talk rather than actual content disputes. I'm sorry Peter, but this isn't a debating society and Meditors aren't here to keep score.[[User:AndyL|AndyL]]16:54, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
:Arbitration was denied because mediation hadn't occurred yet.  And you are the one abusing mediation by pretending that there are no disputes simply because people are being civilized, and by basically running away and trying to start the same process all over again on a different article.  Gbambino is, perhaps, a little over-enthousiastic, but seemingly in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|good faith]].  You have abandoned even the pretense of good faith participation by asserting not simply [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]], but original research known to be wrong. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 00:49, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

"Arbitration was denied because mediation hadn't occurred yet."

That's a misrepresentation. What ambi said and the other arbitrators concurred with was "RfC or the mediation cabal seem to be more appropriate for this. I can't see any evidence of wrongdoing that warrants us getting involved from either party."

Arbitration was rejected because there was no evidence of wrong doing. Meditation or RFC was suggested as a more appropriate remedy. To read that as meaning arbitration was rejected because there hadn't beem mediation is both self-serving and factually incorrect. And as the actual basis of the content dispute was resolved to pretend that this could go back to arbitration is disengenuous of you.  

As for "original research", what you previously labelled "original research" was an argument that appeared in the [[British monarchy]] talk page and was not a proposal for content. When you were unable to provide a counterargument regarding the Queen's residency in the UK and the fact that she has a quite different relationship with the UK than with the other "Commonwealth realms" you pulled out "original research" as an escape mechanism even though my argument wasn't meant for the actual article but simply as a supporting argument for why the name of the article should remain [[British monarchy]]. If you are now applying the original research label to Rouleau I suggest you look on the posts made on this talk page around 16 June when another editor intervened to stop gbambino from vandalising the article by removing the Rouleau quotations he hates so much

You also remove factual statements about the Crown in Right of Canada and deem them as conjecture, or "Monarchist League propaganda," citing ''your own personal theory'' on Rouleau's ruling as ''proof you are correct''!

=== Summary of Constitutional Law regarding the Monarchy in Canada ===

# The institution and person of the monarchy is '''shared''' between all of the Commonwealth Realms. [[Statute of Westminster]], 1931.  Also confirmed in [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003]].
# The legal person of Her Majesty in right of Canada is '''separate''' from the Queen's constitutional roles in the other Commonwealth Realms.  Note 1953 coronation.
# All of the Commonwealth Realms are in a relationship of '''equals''' with one another. [[Statute of Westminster]], 1931.  Also confirmed in [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003]].  Also 1926 Imperial Conference: "They are autonomous Communities [within the British Empire], equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown."
# New legislation of the UK Parliament has no force in Canada.  [[Patriation|Canada Act]], 1982.  Also [[Statute of Westminster]], 1931. 
# The Sovereign is not a private citizen.  Therefore notions such as citizenship are meaningless.
*Sources: [[Statute of Westminster]], 1931. [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. [http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onsc/2003/2003onsc11019.html O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003].

*There are two principles in the succession of the Crown in Canada: the succession is unchanged from the constitutional situation in 1931, and the succession is identical in all the Commonwealth Realms. (Rouleau alluded to these.) The (highly unlikely) hypothetical situation [you're discussing] could, possibly, bring these principles into conflict. Rouleau made a useful analogy, that of an international treaty, and your scenario would be like the UK renegging on its obligations. As the UK is a sovereign state, Canada cannot prevent this (and vice versa). Either Canadian courts of law would resolve this, or Parliament (of Canada), or constitutional amendment would resolve the conflict, if it was determined there was one. [You're] suggesting the UK solution would be automatically adopted in Canada, which is obviously incorrect, not to mention original research. Peter Grey 6 July 2005 18:26 (UTC)

===Change to succession===

* The UK did change the laws of succession in 1936, after the Statute of Westminster, by passing the [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]], which applied in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Under the Statute of Westminster, the UK Parliament can still pass laws for Canada, if requested/or agreed to do so, however there is no definition of what "requested" or "agreed" means. Therefore the UK can still amend the laws of succession, and have them apply in Canada, without formal approval of the Canadian Parliament. This happended in 1936, and can still happen now, regardless of the provisions of the Canada Act 1982. [[User:Astrotrain|Astrotrain]] 21:54, July 11, 2005 (UTC)

*''By modern convention she is regarded as the head of state''
**The Queen is the ''de jure'' head of state by any definition, not 'regarded' by mere 'convention'.

Richard Toproski (sp?), a monarchist and professor (I believe) of constitutional law argues that a monarch cannot be considered a "head of state" because, legally, a monarch *is* the state ie the queen cannot be head of herself. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]]

**'Primacy' is incorrect, it only identified a "first-among-equals" relationship.

Both "primacy" and "first among equals" may be a matter of reading in something that isn't there. A word like "preference" or "priority" is more neutral and accurate. [[User:AndyL|AndyL]]

*''the Letters of Credence... are addressed to the Governor General of Canada without making any reference to the Queen''
**Incorrect, the letters continue to refer to the Queen.  (The insubordinate character of the change is a separate question.)

The passage is trying to address a recent change in the way letters of credence are handled. It was enough to get the MLC upset and writing letters of complaint so while the sentence should be modified for accuracy's sake it's not a "seperate question". [[User:AndyL|AndyL]]

It's not confusing at all. Most reasonable people looking at the Queen's title in Canada would conclude that her British role is being given priority over her Canadian one.

Do you seriously believe that if you surveyed 1000 Canadians and asked them about the UK being listed prior to Canada in the Queen's Canadian title, they wouldn't think that it implies her British role is more important than her Canadian one?

Evidently the Australians thought this since they changed the Queen's Australian title in the mid-1970s to delete reference to the UK where, previously, her title had listed the UK prior to Australia. I'm sure if we were to look up the Hansard entries from that debate in the Australian legislature you'd find a number of MPs expressing dismay that the Queen's Australian title listed her UK first.

:In terms of symbolism there is the [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Queen's personal Canadian Standard]], the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]], the Queen's effigy on Canadian coins and currency, the 50 cent stamp with the Bryan Adams portrait of the Queen, as well as the flags and crests of the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada#Precedence_and_privileges Governor General of Canada/Precedence and privileges]).  Off the top of my head, those are the first distinctly Canadian things I can think of. Also, how the Crown operates in this country is, I believe, somewhat different from its operation in others.  For example, its position in the relationship between the provincial and the federal governments. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 22:54, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

Those things are hardly "distinct" or unique to Canada, they are derivative of British practice that is copied in most, if not all, of the Commonwealth realms and are also completely superficial.

The Governor General of Canada has a flag, the Governor General of New Zealand has a different flag, but I would hesitate to call that a distinction.

Monarchists in Canada argue that the monarchy is "Canadian" and not foreign, hence the "Maple Crown" coinage (rather sappy if you ask me). Republicans, such as Jeffrey Simpson, argue that the monarchy is "foreign" and/or British. You cannot deny that argument exists and you cannot delete it because you dislike it. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 23:36, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

This seems silly - the monarchy is both shared and separate.  Neither aspect can be used to defeat the other - they are not in contradiction.  Different people ''prefer'' to consider one aspect or another, but that is ''only'' opinion. Saying the Queen is foreign is an error of fact; saying the Queen ''seems'' foreign is a legitimate opinion. Saying the Queen is distinctly Canadian is not true in an absolute sense, but is true on a part-time basis, and is also legitimate as an opinion. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 23:59, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

:You're right Peter, but this doesn't actually have to do with a perception of "foreign-ness" on the part of the Queen.

:Andy:
:"''Modern monarchists argue that the monarchy is a Canadian institution...''"
:Wrong.  The entity known as the ''Crown in Right of Canada'' is what monarchists argue is a Canadian institution, not ''The'' Crown/Monarchy over all the Realms.

:"''...and that there is, in Canada a "Maple Crown" distinct from but not inferior to the British Crown''".
:The "Maple Crown" is a metaphor applied to the Crown in Right of Canada by monarchists.  This too is covered in the sentence "...which is dubbed by monarchists as the "Maple Crown."  That the Crown in Right of Canada is equal to and seperate from the Crown in Right of the UK ''is not a monarchist creation''.

And since the section in question is on monarchist and republican arguments it is valid, indeed necessary, to note those differences of opinion rather than censor them. 
::Merely because the MLC (or republicans) say something, does not make it an 'argument' or point of view.

I've removed gbambino's misleading statement regarding Rouleau's reference to a "Canadian Crown" See Peter Grey's comment in [[Talk:Commonwealth Realm]] repeated below:

* The concept of multiple Crowns is a useful metaphor for describing the shared vs. separate character of the monarchy. It is apparently not, in Canadian law at least, the correct usage of 'Crown' as a legal term. Rouleau clearly discussed one shared Crown - "Canadian Crown" was only used in a counterfactual, so clearly there are not two Crowns to be compared.  
[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 03:08, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:It's no more 'misleading' than your stating that the "British Crown" Rouleau refers to is the same as the "Crown in Right of the UK."

*''Copied from [[Talk:Commonwealth realm]]'': In legal terms, 'Crown' '''in context''' may mean the Crown specifically of Canada or of a province. A provincial Crown Corporation is obviously not shared across the Commonwealth. The point is that it's not the term used when the distinction is explicit. Peter Grey 22:41, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

==You've got to be kidding me==

GBambino: Since the Crown is a shared institution, we really do need some clarification as to what is "distinctly Canadian", and what sense of the word 'Crown' is being referred to, since it does have different meanings.

AndyL: The monarchy represents a [[personal union]], distinct legal personalities, and a relationship of equal, sovereign states. Those principles are fundamental to constitutional law in Canada - if you want to suggest any of those are untrue, you will need something stronger than your personal opinion, you need to cite a source that is unbiased and more recent than 1982, not just a few quotes from legal documents taken out of context.

I think '''both of you''' should read [[WP:NPOV]] from beginning to end before making any more edits. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 03:56, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
==Different kinds of crowns==
:What I've been attempting to make clear is that it is the Crown in Right of Canada (a recognised body in Canadian legal documents) which monarchists (and even non-monarchists) see as a Canadian institution-- that is, the "branch", or "distinct legal personality," of The Crown (the shared body) which operates within Canada's governments.
:Though there are distinctly Canadian cultural and symbolic aspects attached to the Crown within Canada (which I agree we should continue to explore), the fact that the Crown in Right of Canada is a legal entity separate from the Crown in Australia, in New Zealand, in Belize, or in the UK, is enough to state that there exists a "Crown of Canada."  This is exactly how the Australian Constitutional Committee explains the existence of the Crown of Australia: "The sovereignty of each of the countries that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their Queen is separate and distinct from that of any other country. Whether in domestic or foreign affairs the 'Crown of the United Kingdom' may pursue quite different policies from that of the Crown of Australia. The Queen's advisers are different in each case. The reference to the United Kingdom is therefore a source of confusion and does not reflect the position of the Crown in Australia today."
:As we know, Andy is attempting to discount the existence of the Crown in Right of Canada, using a misinterpretation of Rouleau as support (even though Rouleau refers to the "Crown of Canada", to "the King or Queen of Canada" apart from "the King or Queen of Great Britain", and most obviously, the respondents in the case are Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario).  In essence, he is trying to create arguments where they don't exist, with nothing but a personal interpretation of a court ruling as support. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 05:28, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

I don't discount the existence of the "Crown in Right of Canada", I discount the existence of a Canadian monarchy, unlike the MLC which publishes articles such as "The Emergence of the Canadian Monarchy", something when you asserted in your edit notes that monarchists do not claim there is a "Canadian monarchy" but a Canadian Crown. You falsely claimed in you edit notes that "monarchists do not say 'monarchy' is Canadian" yet clearly, on the MLC site, they do. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 15:50, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

"The Canadian Monarchy" is a metaphor for the more legal sounding "Crown in Right of Canada."  Monarchy, Crown, and Sovereign are all synonymous; saying the "Canadian Monarchy" is no different to saying the "Canadian Crown" or "Canadian Queen."  The "Canadian Monarchy" (read: Crown in Right of Canada) did emerge with the developments between the Balfour Declaration in 1926 and the patriation of the Constitution in 1982.  Though monarchists do not use legal nomenclature, what they speak of is not the stuff of fantasy. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 16:04, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

1) There is no clear divide between a "Monarchy in Canada" article and a "Queen of Canada" article. The decision on what goes where would be arbitrary.
2) It is the usual practice in wikipedia to, when an article gets too long, spin off one or more sections into their own article. As there is no clear "Queen of Canada" section, the proposal goes against this practice. I have, instead, created a [[Royal visits to Canada]] article which has accomplished the goal of reducing the size of the main article and done so in a clean way without requiring the rewriting of it. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 14:34, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

::The article could eaisly be seperated. A Queen of Canada article would concentrate on the Queen's title, Canadian visits, constituional role and history in Canada, Canadian symbols of monarchy etc. A monarcy in Canada article would concentrate on republic v monarchy, and anyother things on the future role. [[User:Astrotrain|Astrotrain]] 21:05, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

== Kingdoms and Realms ==

Gbambino, please explain to us how this sentence is POV:
"Monarchists reject republican assertions that the monarchy is a British, rather than Canadian, institution."

Also, please cite one law or official document that refers to Canada as a "kingdom". [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 15:36, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

In his edit notes gbambino asks "Can you provide legal reference to Canada as a "Realm"?". One that comes immediately to mind is the Royal Styles and Titles Act, 1953 which refers to the Queen's "other realms" (not just "her realms" but "her other realms") indicating that Canada too is a realm. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 15:53, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:As explained in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_in_Canada&action=history History], monarchists do not say the Monarchy as a whole is Canadian -- only the Crown/Queen in Right of Canada. This fact is already covered in paragraph where it states "...they assert are the distinct Canadian aspects of the Crown in Right of Canada, which is sometimes referred to by Canadian monarchists as the 'Maple Crown'."
:As for referring to Canada as a kingdom, a reference to legal documents is not necessary.  Canada's name is not "the Kingdom of Canada" (though it almost was), however this does not negate the fact that the country is a kingdom.  The argument that the Queen's title is proof that Canada is not a kingdom reveals its own fallaciousness when trying to apply the same logic to explain that the Queen's title means the United Kingdom is not a kingdom.
:Though Canada is also a Realm, kingdom is also acceptable, accurate, and appropriate when speaking of Canada gaining full sovereignty with the patriation of the Constitution.  To keep removing the word is being nothing more than purposefully  inflammatory, and removing something simply because you don't like it. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 15:55, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

"monarchists do not say the Monarchy as a whole is Canadian"
Neither does the sentence you removed. But monarchists do say there is a Canadian monarchy, see MLC articles like "The Emergence of the Canadian Monarchy".

"Though Canada is also a Realm, kingdom is also acceptable, accurate, and appropriate"
Provide a source that says that. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 15:59, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Since Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a sovereign who holds the title king or queen, obviously Canada is a kingdom.  However, that doesn't seem to add anything to 'realm', and since it's used so rarely it's not clear if the term makes the article better. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 16:03, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:Certainly realm, kingdom, and constitutional monarchy are all acceptable.  Canada is referred to as a realm a number of times throughout the article already, and if kingdom is acceptable there is no reason why it should be censored. Andy's just being antagonistic again. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 16:09, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Again, please provide a source regarding the use of the term "kingdom" in regards to Canada. Thus far, we only have your POV that the term is "acceptable" but no proof. I understand that Canada has a monarch and thus may be regarded as a "kingdom" but the term is not in common usage in regards to Canada and never has been -- indeed the term "dominion" was specifically coined so that the term "kingdom" could be avoided -- and it's not for wikipedia to buck accepted practice. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 18:48, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:Stating it is "not in common usage" does not make it inaccurate.  Nor does the point that Canada was officially named as a Dominion.  Canada was a kingdom then (hence, the desire to name it Kingdom of Canada), and still is today.  It is not a contradiction or an error to refer to Canada as an independent kingdom. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 19:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Then cite some examples of Canada being called a kingdom.[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 19:25, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Why? --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 19:28, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Because if you and a few other fringe monarchists are the only ones who use the term "kingdom" to describe Canada it's not an acceptable term to use in wikipedia when referring to the country. In theory, it is not incorrect or inaccurate to refer to the United Kingdom as a dominion, the US as a free state, the current German republic as a reich, Sweden as a commonwealth etc but we don't do that because those terms are not in accepted usage in reference to those countries. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 19:58, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, not all of those are correct, but that's irrelevant.  Canada ''is'' a kingdom, and examples of it being called Kingdom of Canada can be dug up if we really want them. But it's still not clear that using 'kingdom' would be an improvement to the article. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 20:13, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

You're right-- and it's already been said: kingdom, constitutional monarchy, realm are all accurate.  It's just that the sentence stated (and I'll note that I didn't originally write it): "Canada gained full independence as an autonomous kingdom when the [[constitution of Canada|constitution]] was patriated under Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Trudeau]] in [[1982]]."  There was nothing wrong with it.  Kingdom/constitutional monarchy -- it's just another synonym. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 20:33, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Oh, I'm sure that as with gbambino and kingdom someone could fashion arguments that all those are correct (the UK is a dominion of the Queen, it could be argued). The fact remains that calling Canada a kingdom is not only an uncommon usage, it's basically unheard of. We could also start referring to Her Majesty's Toronto Transit Commission or Her Majesty's Canadian Broadcasting Corporation since, technically, it is not incorrect to invoke such usages but that doesn't mean we should do it. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 20:29, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

== Rouleau....again ==

Can I now ask why the Rouleau ruling is mentioned in "Constitutional Monarchy in Canada?"  What purpose is it serving? --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 20:41, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

You objected to it being in monarchist arguments so I moved it. The purpose it serves is as one of the features of the monarchy in Canada. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 20:43, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

The Rouleau decision was to dismiss a petition, so there is no sense in which it can add anything new to the article, unless there is a legal scholar or other unbiased authority that can be cited which suggests otherwise. Quotations out of context are not suitable. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 20:51, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

Its presence in "Monarchist Arguments" was objectionable because you were trying to use it to counter what you say monarchists say, when, in fact, the extra quotations I added (and you attempted to delete) actually showed that Rouleau contradicts your claims and ''affirms'' what you say monarchists say.  But ultimately it served no purpose there, the ruling is neither a republican nor a monarchist argument and added nothing new.  Now that it's in "Constitutional Monarchy in Canada" it still serves no purpose, it still adds nothing that isn't already covered in the article. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:02, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

I disagree. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 21:13, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

While I concded that gbambino's additions are unnecessary I see no where else in the article where it is established that "Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries" is a "constitutional principle."[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 21:20, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
*It's the '''very first bullet point''' under 'Constitutional Monarchy in Canada'. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 21:24, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

"''I concded that gbambino's additions are unnecessary''"
Oh, they're necessary to eliminate the message you're trying to convey by conveniently leaving them out.  But that doesn't negate my point that ultimately the ruling really means nothing to the article. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:39, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:"It's the very first bullet point under 'Constitutional Monarchy in Canada'"
Which is where Rouleau's quote now resides, appropriately enough. Gbambino's extraneous additions about Rouleau saying Crown of Canada once and King and Queen of Canada another time should not be included as they are irrelevent to the bullet point. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 01:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:It is obvious you are including quotes out of context in hopes they will render the article more confusing, not less.  You have yet to identify any new information the ruling provides, or cite any source as to its interpretation. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 02:28, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

I'm providing no interpretation, the quotation is supporting the point being made in the paragraph within which it appears. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 03:41, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:I provide no interpretation either.  The quotations regarding the King and Queen of Canada and the Crown of Canada should remain as they are just as relevant as any regarding the "British Crown".  Or... are you upset that they contradict the message you're trying to subtly (but in reality not so subtly) convey by pulling your carefully selected quotes out of context?
:All the quotations, however, are unnecessary, they serve no uselful purpose. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 15:02, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

*''supporting the point'' means there is no new information.  Redundancy weakens the article, it does not improve it.  [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 15:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
Before mediation, you promoted your personal, and highly biased, interpretation of Rouleau's decision, where you attempted to indicate that Rouleau had identified the Crown as subject to the UK Parliament (clearly impossible as such a statement would be beyond the authority of a ''Canadian'' court of law), rather than the obvious understanding that he meant the shared Crown.  Since mediation began, you have instead inserted quotations, out of context and in clear contradiction to the intent of the decision, in the hope that readers will be confused. This is not [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|good faith]] editing, it is a [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] violation.  You have merely adopted a more subtle tactic for the duration of mediation. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 15:19, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Indeed, Andy admitted his purpose for inserting the out of context quotations at [[Talk:Commonwealth Realm]]:
:"''Any of the quotations in regards to the 'British Crown'... put into doubt the contention that there is a Canadian Crown or that it is equal to the British Crown.''" Andy 02:07, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
Also:
:"''The quote makes clear that Commonwealth Realms, or at least Canada, are under the "British Crown" despite popular mythology that we are not.''"  Andy 05:11, 22 July 2005 (UTC)
So here we have admission that the purpose behind pulling quotes out of context is to convey the [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]] that there has been some sort of monarchist conspiracy theory for the past 70+ years to brainwash the world into thinking that the Crown operates separately and equally in each Realm, when it apparently doesn't. Andy is trying to convince readers that Canada is not an independent country, and is subservient to the British government due to his theory that there is no equality amongst the Commonwealth Realms.  As '''no''' constitutional expert, lawyer, judge, scholar, publication, or even republican group supports this theory, not only is it not [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|good faith]] editing, a [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] violation, but is, without doubt, [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 15:37, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Gbambino: a) I don't recall the mediator ever speaking of an NPOV violation or original research. They are your invention as is your monarchist conspiracy theory. Indeed, it seems that you latched on to Peter Grey's use of the phrase "original research" in the same manner as you latched on to his use of the word "metaphor" ie with no actual understanding of the concepts. 

b) read the bullet point- the quotation relates to it very well contextually and factually. The fact that you don't like the quotation is not a good reason not to use it.

c) if you read what is actually said you'll see  

Please relate your comments to the actual contents of the article, not to your interpretations and speculations. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 17:34, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Here is the bullet point in question. What, precisely, is your objection? Where is the "original research" or POV? Be specific and relate your answer only to what appears in the bullet point and not to arguments made previously in talk:
:* Although Queen Elizabeth II is also monarch of the [[United Kingdom]] and several other Commonwealth countries, each nation - including Canada - is sovereign and independent of the others.  The identity of the sovereign is determined by the conditions set out in the [[Act of Settlement]].  Under the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]], Canada has a common monarchy with Britain and the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s and cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless Canada explicitly leaves the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. Justice Rouleau, in a 2003 court ruling (see below) asserted that "Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries" is a "constitutional principle."  As a result of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] the [[dominion]]s acquired the right to be considered equal to Britain rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the dominions were subordinate.  The subsequent [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]].

:The content is this: quotations out of context.  Taking quotations out of context causes confusion about their meaning.  After failing to blatantly assert your POV, you are now taking the more covert route of leaving these disjointed quotations for others to form their own opinions on, in the hopes they will misinterpret the words "British Crown" the same way you do, and then believe the whole "Canada is subservient to the British government" 'original research' you've been pushing.  It's obvious that people cannot form proper opinions about a subject unless given the full and accurate framework that goes with it.  Therefore quotations out of context are not acceptable and should be removed.  The ruling and interpretations are already dealt with at [[O'Donohue v.

::Your comments are original research and POV, meaning your edits are against Wikipedia's good faith policy. --gbambino

My comments were made in the Talk page, gbambino, not in the article. Do you actually have a clue what you are talking about when you talk about NPOV and original research? These concepts apply to the '''content of articles only''' not to what people say in Talk pages.

The Rouleau quotations are not out of context. They just don't fit your particular interpretation and you have to torture them to try to make them fit. I'm sorry gbambino but neither you nor Peter are constitutional scholars and it is not for you to decide whether or not Rouleau is wrong or whether or not Rouleau really means what he says. You are not an authority so stop pretending that you are. You have failed to show that the line is either NPOV or "original research". It is in context, it explains the relationship between Crown and Commonwealth in a Canadian context, it is relevent to the bullet point and lends evidence to the assertion made in the bullet point. Just because you don't like the fact that Rouleau says "British" and would prefer it if he had fit your POV by saying "Canadian" is not sufficient reason for censoring the quotation. And I'm sorry, gbambino, but what you tried to add does not "contextualise" the quote as your additions have nothing to do with the bullet point and are, in any case, irrelevent.

And Peter, as you know, judical rulings trump interpretations written by law professors so even if you find a quotation by a legal scholar that better fits your POV it should not displace a quotation from a judicial ruling. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 19:03, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

*''whether or not Rouleau really means what he says'' That pretty much sums up the debate, doesn't it? [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 19:11, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Yes, you don't like the quotation or indeed much of what Rouleau wrote so you and gbambino are trying to rationalise it away by assuming he didn't really mean what he said and therefore you want to remove it or finesse it away. Now *that* is POV. 
*You have that backwards. I have no problem with the decision, the decision supports the mainstream interpretation. The only part supporting your claim is the one quote, and even then only when out of context.  I'm not convinced you've even read the decision. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 19:23, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

I read the decision. Remember, you misunderstood his reference to the 1982 amending formula thinking that it might refer to any change in the succession, even one agreed upon by all the realms and I corrected you. 

So what is your problem with the quotation, Peter, and what context would you put it in? Make a proposal. And can you persuade gbambino to stay out of this? I'm getting tired of dealing with his rantings and his habit of picking up a word from you like "original research" or "metaphor" and reciting it like some sort of mantra without any sort of understanding.[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 19:31, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

However, unless you can find a ruling by a more senior court that contradicts Rouleau I'm afraid you'll just have to live with his quotation as it represents the highest court ruling in Canada on the question to date - even if you don't like it. He's a judge; you're just a monarchist, I'm afraid his word trumps yours.[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 19:16, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:Thank you, Andy, for admitting that you have carefully chosen particular quotations from Rouleau's ruling only to support your interpretation of it, and wish to ignore those that don't.  You are also not a constitutional scholar, nor an expert, so it is not up to you to decide what Rouleau means either (though, so far every constitutional scholar supports what Peter and I say, and you've provided absolutely, umm... oh yes, '''nothing''' to support your theories).

::If the UK changed the succession and Canada wanted to follow suit, it would still need a s.41 amendment in order to be recognized by Canadian courts of law. Peter Grey 21:50, 15 July 2005

:::Now, Peter has interpreted part of Rouleau's ruling... "Such changes would, for all intents and purposes, bring about a fundamental change in the office of the Queen without securing the authorizations required pursuant to s. 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982." ...as meaning that the rules of succession in Canada can only be changed through a constitutional amendment even if the other realms change theres.

:::Well, hold on a second, let's look at the whole paragraph " Unilateral changes by Canada to the rules of succession, whether imposed by the court or otherwise, would be contrary to the commitment given in the Statute of Westminster, would break symmetry and breach the principle of union under the British Crown set out in the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867. Such changes would, for all intents and purposes, bring about a fundamental change in the office of the Queen without securing the authorizations required pursuant to s. 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982."

:::Well, I see that as meaning that a constitutional amendment is needed for unilateral changes to the rules of succession, not that one is needed for a non-unilateral change.

From your avoidance of the question we can take it that you ''do'' wish to create confusion, purposefully create questions where there are none, by allowing people to only read the Rouleau quotations which you have carefully selected based on their importance to your POV and 'original research'.  Of course, you have already admitted that earlier when stating that the quotations you chose support your 'original research' that the Commonwealth Realms are not equal, and Canada is subordinate to the British Parliament.  I do believe that's rather manipulative and misleading, not to mention that it demonstrates a bit of a control problem...

Please don't make ridiculous assertions. I wasn't avoiding the question - you were (deliberately?) unclear about what you were proposing. You didn't say, initially, you wanted to remove the quotation, you said you wanted people to read the entire ruling which implied pasting the entire ruling into the article, hence my request that you come up with something practical. 

You are proposing censoring the article. A hyperlink to the ruling and/or a link to the article on the ruling would be appropriate. Removing the quotation is not appropriate. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 20:38, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:I propose no such thing.  Links to [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003]] are appropriate where appropriate -- perhaps in relation to the Act of Settlement, or CCR.  A link to the ruling itself can be provided at [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003]], if not done already.  However, Rouleau's ruling raises no questions about the Crown over the Realms, in Canada, or puts Canada's sovereignty into question, so it need not be mentioned every time the word "Crown" comes up along with "Canada" or "Realm."
:The quotations remain out of their context and therefore are misleading and confusing.  They are not appropriate here, nor at [[Commonwealth Realm]]. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 20:43, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

You are proposing removing a quotation you don't like - that's censorship. Now tell me, how are readers interested in the first bullet point supposed to know that it might be a good idea for them to read Rouleau if you are removing the quotation? After all, you claim you want people to read the entire ruling but your proposal would make it less likely that they would be aware the ruling exists. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 20:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

You claim the quotations are out of context (but provide no evidence of this) but your only alternative is having readers read the ''entire'' court ruling. By your logic we can't have any quotations anywhere in wikipedia since they are all out of context (ie not in their original source document). [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 20:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

* "''I wasn't avoiding the question - you were (deliberately?) unclear about what you were proposing.''" It was a legitimate question about whether or not you felt it right that people should form opinions about something based on only bits and pieces selected by someone with a strong bias.  You completely avoided it. 
* "''You are proposing removing a quotation you don't like - that's censorship.''" Perhaps we can look at it this way: you're proposing keeping a particular quotation because it serves your bias - that's manipulation to support your POV.  I am not offended by Rouleau's ruling, what is offensive is your exploitation of it to suit your own ends.
* "''How are readers interested in the first bullet point supposed to know that it might be a good idea for them to read Rouleau if you are removing the quotation.''"  Why on earth do they need to specifically read Rouleau?  It does not mention anything that readers couldn't get from a clearer and easier to read source, and does not cause any questions to be raised about the Crown, Canada's independence, or its relationship to the UK.
* "''You claim the quotations are out of context (but provide no evidence of this)''" Are you serious?  Perhaps you're unaware of what "out of context" means.
* "''By your logic we can't have any quotations anywhere in wikipedia since they are all out of context (ie not in their original source document).''" Ridiculous.  You've admitted you specifically chose those quotations because out of thier context they support your POV and 'original research'.  You've conveniently omitted those (and deleted those) that don't because they provide more information and create a clearer picture about what Rouleau's point was -- and it actually goes ''against'' what you're trying to assert.

''I think a very strong argument can be made that any change by Britain in the rules of succession would automatically apply to Canada by virtue of what the current constitution of Canada says''. '''Completely false'''.  What the Constitution of Canada says is: ''No Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the Constitution Act, 1982 comes into force shall extend to Canada as part of its law''.  The ''reverse'' situation, which is what you actually alluded to, is of course governed by [[parliamentary supremacy]]. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 23:32, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Peter, even if you disagree with me on the effect of the 1867 preamble, the fact remains that your assertion that Rouleau was saying a constitutional amendment for a change to the succession would be necessary even if there was consensus among the realms is incorrect. He was only speaking of the need for a constitutional amendment in the case of a '''unilateral''' change in the succession by Canada.

Hey, it was you who was asking me wheter I think people should read the entire decision. I guess you were being disingenuous when you asked that your previous question. In any case, as I said, I'm fine with having a hyperlink following the quotation so that readers can peruse the entire judgement - that is how we do things on wikipedia.

There has been an attempt by the MLC and to some extent by the Department of Canadian Heritage to rebrand the monarchy and remove any reference to it being at all British. While there are political motives behind this the fact remains that constitutionally and legally it is not at all incorrect to refer to the Crown in Canada as the "British Crown". Moreover, in the context of the Crown under which the various Commonwealth realms are united it is pefectly correct to refer to this as the "British Crown" a) in order to distinguish from, say, the Danish Crown b) because there is no such thing as the "Commonwealth Crown.".

:You seem very puzzled by the fact that Justice Rouleau addressed O'Donohue's complaints and not your own fictional constitutional crisis. Rouleau considered unilateral change in the succession by Canada because that was '''what the petition was about'''.  He did not invalidate the fundamentals of the 1982 Consitution.  He also wrote in his decision: "The constitutional scheme of our democratic government consists of four branches: the Crown, the legislative body, the executive and the courts."  So I guess the article needs to spell out that the ''British'' Crown is a branch of the ''Canadian'' government. Maybe we're not in a relationship of equals after all! Obviously, we'll need to include that quote or people might incorrectly assume that the United Kingdom is a sovereign nation. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 16:08, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

Peter, Rouleau never said that a constitutional amendment was necessary to change the succession in the manner outlined in the Statute of Westminster. That was your misinterpretation. He was only speaking of the hypothetical need for a constitutional amendment if Canada were to change the succession unilaterally.[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 16:40, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

Peter, any case before the courts will deal either with a specific incident or complaint involving an aggrieved party and/or with jurisdictional matters. The specific focus of Rouleau's ruling was the O'Donohue complaint regarding the constitutionality of the Act of Settlement prohibition on Catholics assuming the throne. However, the ruling had to deal with the jurisdictional question regarding the Act of Settlement and therefore on the relationship between the Crown, the Commonwealth Realms and Canada. It is that relationship that the quotation is in refernce to and that is relevent to the bullet point. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 16:45, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

* AndyL/Homey has taken an Ontario court ruling by Justice Rouleau ([[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003]] [http://www.monarchyfreecanada.org/Odonohue.htm 1]) and has mistakenly interpreted the judge's references to the shared "British Crown" as meaning the Crown within the jurisdiction of the UK Parliament.
* He is thus stating that Canada (along with the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s) is not an independent and equal country under the Crown, but is subservient to the UK Parliament.
* This is in opposition to the [[Balfour Declaration, 1926]], the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], the [[Constitution of Canada]], as well as Constitutional Committee reports from Australia, court rulings from Australia, and the words of constitutional experts such as Canadian Senator [[Eugene Forsey]], Richard Toporoski, and Dr. Michael Jackson, as well as [[Louis St. Laurent|Prime Minister St. Laurent]], [[Vincent Massey]], and many others.
* To back himself up Andy/Homey has pulled only certain quotations of Rouleau out of their context so as to ignore the judge's own assertions about the "sharing" of the Crown, the "symmetrical" relationship amongst the Realms, and the control Canada holds over the Crown in Right of Canada and the line of succession to it.
* He continues to state that these quotations must remain in the article so as to now imply, rather than specifically state, that there is some question about Canada's sovereignty.  Andy/Homey has expressly admitted that these quotations were chosen so as to support his personal theories, and thus their retention is only for the purpose of deliberately causing confusion.

:What you argue I am arguing  is not reflected in the bullet point being discussed therefore your points are irrelevent. There is no reference, whatsoever, to the British Parliament or its jurisdiction in the bullet point.[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 16:00, 27 July 2005 (UTC)  

There has been an attempt by the MLC and to some extent by the Department of Canadian Heritage to rebrand the monarchy and remove any reference to it being at all British. While there are political motives behind this the fact remains that constitutionally and legally it is not at all incorrect to refer to the Crown in Canada as the "British Crown".

I'm sorry if the quotation is not consistent with the rebranding attempt but it is correct and yes, in context notwithstanding Gbambino's unique belief that something can only be in context if the entire document from which it is taken is included. 

In short, I'm arguing that Peter and gbambino are allowing their POVs to drive their desire to remove a quotation from a legal judgement because the language used refers to the Crown as "British". As monarchists, they feel this is not desriable as it may reenforce public perceptions that the head of state is not Canadian. 

Gbambino has been unable to prove that the quotation is out of context. Indeed, when directly challenged to prove his claim or to refute any of the content of the bullet point he response in ways that redefine the meaning of words like "context" and "content" or suggest he doesn't know what these terms mean (ie he discusses everything *but* the actual content of the bullet point in contention). Peter Grey seems to concede that the quote is relevent but derides it as unnecessary or superfluous even though it is from a judicial ruling and provides evidence for the point being asserted in the bullet point. Again, I suspect he does not want the quote there simply because he feels the reference to the "British Crown" is contrary to the view promoted by Canadian monarchists even though it is perfectly correct (as he, himself, has conceded elsewhere when he stated that in Canadian law there is no such term as "Canadian Crown" or "Crown of Canada). As such his argument for not including the quotation is disingenuous. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 15:50, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

Here is the actual content of the bullet point in question. As you'll see if you read it, virtually all of gbambino's points have nothing to do with the acutal content of the article.
:* Although Queen Elizabeth II is also monarch of the [[United Kingdom]] and several other Commonwealth countries, each nation - including Canada - is sovereign and independent of the others.  The identity of the sovereign is determined by the conditions set out in the [[Act of Settlement]].  Under the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]], Canada has a common monarchy with Britain and the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s and cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless Canada explicitly leaves the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. Justice Rouleau, in a 2003 court ruling (see below) asserted that "Union under the British Crown together with other Commonwealth countries" is a "constitutional principle."  As a result of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] the [[dominion]]s acquired the right to be considered equal to Britain rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the dominions were subordinate.  The subsequent [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]]

::Andy, explain to us why you are so adamant to keep your personally chosen (aka out of context) quotations (not just in the first bullet point, but also in "Republican Arguments" here, and at [[Commonwealth Realm]]) when there are other sources which would illustrate the points in the articles just the same, but without the harder to read technical legalese?  Your answer should keep in mind your earlier assertions:

::Peter, is there such a term as "Canadian Crown" or "Crown of Canada" in law?[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 16:38, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

There is the legal term 'Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in Right of Canada.' This term means the Queen of Canada subject to Canadian law and has absolutely nothing to do with the Queen of the UK or UK law. So in that sense Canada is not under the British Crown. It just happens to have a Queen who wears the British Crown as well.

== Andy/Homey's assertions ==

* "''There has been an attempt by the MLC and to some extent by the Department of Canadian Heritage to rebrand the monarchy and remove any reference to it being at all British.''"  Nobody, including the MLC or Canadian Heritage, has been attempting to cover up any "Britishness" associated with the Monarchy -- this is part of Andy's conspiracy theory that I alluded to earlier.  What Andy/Homey is attempting to do with his out of context Rouleau quotes is deny that the Crown/Monarchy is an institution '''shared equally''' by all 16 Commonwealth Realms.  What the MLC, and perhaps Canadian Heritage, promotes as Canadian is ''only'' the Crown in Right of Canada -- the Crown as it operates ''within the legal jurisdiction of Canada.''
* "''and legally it is not at all incorrect to refer to the Crown in Canada as the "British Crown"''.  Calling the Crown "British" for historical purposes, or due to the lack of a modern terminology for the shared Crown, is a matter of semantics, and does not affect constitutional reality that the "British Crown" as shared is '''not''' the same thing as the Crown ''within the legal jurisdiction of the UK.''
* "''Gbambino's unique belief that something can only be in context if the entire document from which it is taken is included.''" Complete ignorance of my earlier statement: "You've admitted you specifically chose those quotations because out of their context they support your POV and 'original research'. You've conveniently omitted those (and deleted those) that don't because they provide more information and create a clearer picture about what Rouleau's point was -- and it actually goes ''against'' what you're trying to assert."  Context does not necessarily mean the entire document, it means enough of the document to get the proper point across.  Pieces chosen by a strongly biased individual '''do not''' constitute proper context.
* "''he discusses everything *but* the actual content of the bullet point in contention''." Ignoring your actions earlier and elsewhere does not provide you with justification.
* "''Peter Grey seems to concede that the quote is relevent.''" Unfounded.
* "''I suspect he does not want the quote there simply because he feels the reference to the "British Crown" is contrary to the view promoted by Canadian monarchists even though it is perfectly correct (as he, himself, has conceded elsewhere when he stated that in Canadian law there is no such term as "Canadian Crown" or "Crown of Canada).''"

Gbambino, on your own talk page you concede that the entity in question is the "British Crown". You do so in a cicumlocutious manner by saying:
:"The Crown over the Commonwealth Realms, AKA the British Crown by default"

Of course, there is not such legal or constitutional phrase as "The Crown of the Commonwealth Realms", the current term remains "The British Crown" (even though you concede this grudgingly by saying it's "by default") yet you object to the use of the phrase "British Crown" in anything but an historical sense in the article. Why? When you concede that it is the correct term why are you trying to hide it?[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 17:23, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

:It would seem, in my view, that [[User:Gbambino|Gbambino]] was suggesting that while the Crown in Right of Canada is a separate entity, Canada has opted (of its own accord) to continue to concur in the succession practices of the [[Monarchy in Canada]] in keeping with the practices of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom]]—[[Canada]] maintains its own succession legislation, outside of the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

Correct, but confusing without proper explanation.  You've been playing games all along by focusing only on the specific words "British Crown" to assert that Canada has no sovereignty as our government is controlled by the UK Parliament.  You've purposefully ignored the legal and expert sources (including Rouleau) which explain the "British Crown" as shared is different to the Crown within the jurisdiction of the UK parliament, and that no law in the UK, including succession laws, has any effect in Canada.

This is an encyclopaedia where facts should be explained as clearly as possible, not where republican fantasies should be allowed to run rampant.

If you're willing to accept that the Balfour Declaration, the Statute of Westminster, the Canada Act, and the Constitution Act grant Canada full sovereignty and independence; that the Statute of Westminster grants ''equality'' to all the Realms; that the Crown within Canada is a separate legal entity to the Crown within the UK, and that this means alterations to the UK line of succession do not have effect on the line in Canada, ''then'' I think we can proceed. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 18:00, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

The preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867 states that we will have the same monarch as Britain. This is quoted by Rouleau in his ruling. Therefore, it is not at all clear that legally and constitutionally  "alterations to the UK line of succession do not have effect on the line in Canada" indeed, both Rouleau and the Constitution Act suggest the opposite though we would need a further legal ruling on the question to be clear. I'm sorry, I'm not willing to suspend disbelief for you. But I don't know why this is such a big deal for you as '''I haven't put this in any of the articles'''. [[User:HOTR|Homey]]

"focusing only on the specific words "British Crown" to assert that Canada has no sovereignty as our government is controlled by the UK Parliament."

Gbambino, don't try to defend the pathetic irrelevency of 90% of your arguments. I'm disgusted by your dishonest and disingenuous tactics and I'm not going to engage in you any further.

I'm going to need to throw myself in here.  [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty Elizabeth II]] is the [[Queen of Canada]] outright—even if the [[United Kingdom]] were to cease their recognition of the Queen as their monarch, it would not have any effect on Her Majesty as our Queen, or the line to succeed her, provided that the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] would continue to proclaim monarchs to the [[Monarchy in Canada|Canadian Crown]] in keeping with our own succession legislation.  It has been established that the consent of our [[Parliament of Canada]] is required to maintain the unity between the Crowns of the [[Commonwealth Realm]]s—our Realms just happen to have continued to agree on the line of succession to this day.

==gbambino==
It's ironic that gbambino accuses me of quoting Rouleau out of context when he does precisely that to me.

Several times now, gbambino has posted this quotation:

"Any of the quotations in regards to the "British Crown" ... put into doubt the contention that there is a Canadian Crown or that it is equal to the British Crown."

while omitting what follows:

"I'm sorry Peter but you are letting your POV interfere with a fair presentation of the facts. If you want to be a fair editor then you can't filter out information because you think it might be misunderstood. Indeed, I don't think you are capable of being editing fairly or independently of your deeply seated POV."[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Commonwealth_Realm]

Looking at the whole paragraph, it's clear I'm commenting on what I think is Peter's motivation for opposing the Rouleau quotation. Gbambino acts in "bad faith" by excising the second part of my comment so that he can imply that the first setence refers to my motivation rather than Peter's.

Gbambino, you should be ashamed of yourself. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 18:37, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

The second quote gbambino uses:
""The quote makes clear that Commonwealth Realms, or at least Canada, are under the "British Crown" despite popular mythology that we are not." 

This is in response to the question:

"Can you explain what you think the quote adds to the article? What idea it conveys that isn't already stated at least once?"

I stand by what I said. The quotation does make clear that we are under the "British Crown" despite mythology (or what I refer to as "rebranding") that the Crown is entirely Canadian. It does add that to the article and I'm sorry if that is in contradiction to your efforts to deny the British nature of the crown but to use this statement to argue that I am acting in "bad faith" is ridiculous or at the very least a logical fallacy. So I'm sorry gbambino, your "bad faith" charge is not only not proven, it was, if I may say so, made in bad faith.[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 18:46, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

==My comments==

I realize that I'm coming somewhat late to this discussion (reading through the talk page took a fair bit of time ...), and that the main issue may now be resolved to the satisfaction of most parties.  Nonetheless, I'll offer my opinions in the event that this dispute flares up again.

I have never doubted that the monarchy in Canada is essentially "British"; whether, to what extent, and in what sense it is also "Canadian" strikes me as a more obscure legal point, not likely to be decided in any definitive sense unless the issue is brought before the Supreme Court of Canada, or explicitly determined by the Canadian parliament.  

As there is no definitive legal statement on this point, our attention should therefore turn to precedent:

The oft-cited Royal Styles and Titles Act of 1953 lists Elizabeth's official title as "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith".  From my perspective, this sets a strong precedent in favour of the monarch of Canada holding his/her title by virtue of being monarch of the United Kingdom.  An objection could be raised that this Act required the approval of the Canadian parliament to come into force, or that it is not binding upon future decisions relating to the monarchy -- but this is beside the point of the present discussion.  

Judge Rouleau's ruling may be not entirely definitive, but it draws upon the same basic interpretation -- as does St. Laurent's quote from 1953.

As to the article page: I have no strong objection to the wording of the current edit, although I wonder if this "British precedent" could be made clearer in an earlier section.  

I've also moved a sentence, hopefully without changing its basic meaning.  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 05:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC)


The fact that the Royal Styles and Titles Act, 1953 still contains the words "United Kingdom" may affect perceptions about the "nationality" of the Monarchy, at least in regards to Canada.  If Canada followed the example of almost every other Realm and removed the words "United Kingdom" from the Queen's title (as the Act discussed is one of ''Canadian'' Parliament, not the UK), then perceptions might shift slightly.  However, the wording of the Royal Styles and Titles Act doesn't affect the constitutional reality that the Monarchy is symmetrically shared, and legally is as equally "Canadian" as it is "British" or "Australian," or that the Monarch of Canada is chosen by sovereign Canadian constitutional law, not British law.

Rouleau's ruling has no effect on either existing constitutional law, nor do I see it as altering any cultural perceptions of the Crown's "nationality" (save for those who desperately want it to).

I'm content with the wording as it is now, and there should be no mention of any "British precedent" unless it is in regards to cultural perceptions and republicans trying to enhance it for political reasons (though, this is now being somewhat dealt with at [[Commonwealth Realm]]. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 15:31, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

Just so we're all clear:
*Perception as British, or actually being British? "British" in the sense of the United Kingdom, or something more general?  Or "British" the way British Columbia is British? [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 16:49, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

**I meant "British" in the sense of "pertaining to the nation of Great Britain (and Northern Ireland)".  The British monarch was Canada's head of state before the British Empire formally came into being in 1857, and remained Canada's head of state during the period of the British Empire.  Notwithstanding a technical change in this relationship after the creation of the British Commonwealth of Nations, the actual royal line is unchanged -- and the leader of this line remains first and foremost the monarch of Great Britain.  (While I can understand the logic of monarchists in arguing for a "Canadian crown", their case seems rather tenuous -- resting upon a questionable definition of previous statutes, and unsupported by any clear legal finding or judgement ... or even by precedent.)

**Notwithstanding this, I notice that you've recently used the phrase "Commonwealth-British" the [[Commonwealth Realm]] talk page (in distinction from the phrase "UK-British").  Perhaps this phrase could lead the way to an acceptable compromise.  Elizabeth II reigns as Queen of Canada by virtue of her position as leader of the British Commonwealth of Nations -- and this, in turn, is a position which she holds by virtue of her standing as the Queen of Britain.  Therefore, if you wish to refer to the Queen as holding domain in Canada by virtue of her position as the head of the British Commonwealth, I would not object.  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 03:59, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

''"The British monarch was Canada's head of state before the British Empire formally came into being in 1857, and remained Canada's head of state during the period of the British Empire."'' This is a little misleading, as Canada was not a state at that time, but a colony and then Dominion of the United Kingdom, unlike the situation today where the country is a completely sovereign nation, and thus a proper state. [gbambino]

*I never claimed otherwise.  My point was that the British monarch has served as Canada's nominal head of state through a variety of constitutional changes -- and that the line remains unchanged, notwithstanding Balfour and Westminster. [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 18:34, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

''"...the leader of this line remains first and foremost the monarch of Great Britain"''  Again, in what sense?  On what grounds can one say the Queen is "first and foremost" the Queen of the United Kingdom over her role as Queen of Jamaica, or Queen of New Zealand?  Again, legally, absolutely not.  But culturally?  Open to speculation. [gbambino]

*Elizabeth II is first and foremost the monarch of the United Kingdom, in common parlance and historical precedent.  Her other titles flow, at least historically, from Britain's position as leader of the Commonwealth of Nations.  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 18:34, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

''"Elizabeth II reigns as Queen of Canada by virtue of her position as leader of the British Commonwealth of Nations-- and this, in turn, is a position which she holds by virtue of her standing as the Queen of Britain."''  Not at all.  Elizabeth II reigns as Queen of Canada purely and absolutely by Canadian constitutional law.  As well, she is not the head of the Commonwealth of Nations because she is the UK monarch, but because the nations of the Commonwealth decided she should be (thus, Charles will not automatically take his mother's place as head of the Commonwealth simply because he takes her place as Sovereign of the UK). --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 18:06, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

*Perhaps not automatically, but he will certainly assume the role *by extension of* his place as Sovereign of the UK.  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 18:34, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

::You are, of course, correct that for the vast majority of the Monarchy's history the institution has been primarily associated with what we now know as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and those long-standing associations (centuries long) can't be shaken off in a matter of decades.  However, attitudes and perceptions change, and this is why I stated that though many still perceive the Monarchy as a fundamentally British institution, a good number also, once realising the current constitutional situations, see it as evolving into a multi-national one.  It's open to interpretation-- though I think more so now than ever previously. [gbambino]

**Many for some.  Not for most, I would think.  And while advocates of the "Maple Crown" have the right to promote their beliefs, I don't think they have any real legal standing. [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 03:35, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

::As for Charles becoming head of the Commonwealth of Nations by extension of becoming Sovereign of the UK, perhaps.  But as I understand it, it is really up to the member states to decide who becomes the head of the organization upon the demise of the Queen.  Maybe they will 'elect' Charles by default, but perhaps not. None-the-less, whatever happens in terms of that position will have no effect on him becoming King of Canada. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:46, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

**I think you're mistaken on the latter point.  If the head of the British Commonwealth is the same for all nations, and the rules of succession cannot be changed except by the agreement of all nations, then ''logically the head of the British Commonwealth must be the monarch of Canada'' (see below).  (And, as I understand it, the established rules of succession would mandate the choice of the next leader -- there wouldn't be an "election" at all.) [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 03:35, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

:I think you're mistaking the 16 [[Commonwealth Realm|Commonwealth Realms]] with the 53 states that form the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  The head of the Commonwealth of Nations is, I believe, selected by the member-states of that organization.  As for the Commonwealth Realms, the Sovereign is chosen by each individual state's constitutional law, only the Statute of Westminster sets out the convention that they should all agree on who it should be to maintain a unified Crown.  The UK legally holds no superiority over the other 15 Realms.  Thus the UK should not unilaterally alter its line of succession, and if it did, that new monarch would not automatically become Sovereign of Canada. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 16:43, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

You're right -- I was using the phrase "Commonwealth of Nations" when "Commonwealth Realms" would have been the correct choice.  Thanks for the correction.  That said, the rest of your answer strikes me as a dodge.  True, the rules of the game will obviously change if the UK changes its line of succession.  If the UK *doesn't* change its line of succession, however, then the line of succession will remain the same in Britain as in the other Commonwealth nations -- and the monarch of Canada will hold this position by virtue of being the monarch of the British Commonwealth (which, in turn, he/she holds by virtue of being the leader of the historical British royal line).

===role of Statute of Westminster===
''As for the Commonwealth Realms, the Sovereign is chosen by each individual state's constitutional law, only the Statute of Westminster sets out the convention that they should all agree on who it should be to maintain a unified Crown.''  This logic seems awfully close to "Any successor you like, as long as it's Charles".  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 21:30, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

:The relationship of the 16 Realms in regards to the Crown is a symmetrical, or equal one.  Thus, who will be Sovereign really is decided by unanimous agreement by the Realms, and any future changes would necessitate their approval.  This is why Tony Blair has stated that a removal of the bar on Catholics to the Throne will not be dealt with for some time to come as any changes will require the consent of the other Realms. If the UK ''did'' unilaterally alter the line of succession, the effect would be much the same as if Canada did -- a 'fracturing' of the Crown. This is why the Statute of Westminster (part of constitutional law in both countries) spells out the convention that neither nation should act unilaterally in terms of the Monarchy. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 22:02, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

::in theory. Of course, the actions of the Irish Free State upon Edward VIII's abdication demonstrate that the preamble is not binding and a change in the succession can proceed even when approval by all the realms has not been obtained. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 22:08, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

::The preamble is indeed not legally binding, but it does create a convention central to the relationship of the Realms under the Crown.  In the case of Ireland, it has been discussed already elsewhere that Ireland had indeed given their approval to the change in succession but the Irish Prime Minister had botched his end of the bargain by not getting legislation passed by the deadline set, thus leaving Ireland as the only Realm out of the loop, so to speak.  The results of his irresponsibility were corrected the following day and George VI was recognised as King of Ireland. Thus, any Realm has it within their power to alter the line within their own jurisdiction without approval from the other Realms, but in doing so would breach the agreement set out by the Statute of Westminster and cause a 'fracturing' of the Crown. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 03:08, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

It is therefore simply a stated intent that consent of the realms be obtained. If that is inconvenient, it can simply be disregarded. (Which is basically what I've been saying all along). [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 08:35, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

:It is a stated intent that has become a constitutional convention central to the relationship of the Realms under the unitary Crown.  If it is inconvenient it cannot simply be disregarded, as Rouleau makes clear in his ruling. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 13:55, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

*If the point needs to be stated more clearly (personally, I'm not sure it does), I would recommend using Richard Toporoski's expert opinion, which clearly and (more importantly) '''succinctly''' explains '''both''' the legal implications and potential political implications. (Peter Grey)

::Oddly, when Toporoski addressed the question of a division in the crown in an article I cited in [[Talk:Commonwealth Realm]],(which I think is what you are referring to) he didn't even mention the Statute of Westminster. I know he's the MLC's house theorist and everything but I'm a bit dubious about his thoroughness. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 22:56, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

**To be technically precise, I should rephrase: "the monarch of Canada ''cannot be otherwise'' than the head of the British Commonwealth".  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 03:45, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

Again, the "British Commonwealth" is now the Commonwealth of Nations, and the head of that organization has nothing to do with the constitutional monarchy of the 16 Commonwealth Realms.  The Sovereign of Canada can be whomever Canada decides, however Canada has agreed through the Statute of Westminster to have the same sovereign not only as the UK, but as all the other Commonwealth Realms.  This is why the Ontario Justice Rouleau refers to the relationship between the Commonwealth Realms as one of "symmetry." --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 16:43, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

:nor do I see it as altering any cultural perceptions of the Crown's "nationality" 

That would be because the broad cultural perception in Canada (and elsewhere) is that the Crown is British. 

:I'm content with the wording as it is now, and there should be no mention of any "British precedent" unless it is in regards to cultural perceptions

But it's not just cultural - it remains the "British Crown" legally and, of course, historically. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 17:05, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

The Crown is "historically" British?  Yes, as much as the Indian government is "historically" British.  As for it being legally British, you've tried this argument elsewhere and it has been exposed as hollow. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 18:51, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

== Gbambino and POV ==

Gbambino is again showing his POV by removing factual information that he doesn't like or thinks reflects badly on the monarchist position. Several times he has softened references to the fact that only Canada and Grenada retain royal titles for the Queen that list the UK prior to themselves. He softens this by changing the reference to merely retaining the UK in their royal titles. Given that it is a fact that these two countries also list the UK prior to themselves there is no justifiable reason for Gbambino's edit aside from his political agenda. If he does not stop this behaviour I will ask for this article to be protected again and will open an RFC on Gbambino. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 20:59, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

Go ahead, ask for the article to be protected and request an RFC.  As there are clear and logical reasons for my edits (read below) I am not frightened by your hollow threats.  However, if you're going to have a temper tantrum over the fact that some people wont stand idly by while you try to use Wikipedia as a means through which you can make the Monarchy in Canada seem as foreign as possible, I suspect the moderators would rather you did it in a corner at home rather than waste their time with it here. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:33, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== UK first, second or whatever ==

The fact that the original 1953 Royal Styles and Titles Act passed in each Realm listed the Queen's position as Queen of the United Kingdom prior to her position as Queen of (relevant Realm) is already established in the sentence: "''When a new Royal Style and Titles Act was passed at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, it explicitly identified the Queen's role in the United Kingdom and her role in Canada separately, with her role as Queen of the United Kingdom listed before her role as Queen of Canada.''"

It is then explained that only the UK, Canada and Grenada currently retain the 1953 Act: "''Although most other Commonwealth Realms have since removed any explicit reference to the United Kingdom in their versions of Elizabeth II's title, Canada retains its original 1953 Act. As of 2005, other than the United Kingdom, Grenada is the only other Realm to do the same.''"

Thus, if it is already clear that the 1953 Act lists the Queen's role as Queen of the UK prior to her role as Queen of Canada or Grenada, and it is made clear that only Canada and Grenada retain the 1953 Act, then it naturally follows that Canada and Grenada are the only two to list Queen of the UK prior to Queen of Canada or Grenada.  To state they remain the only two to list Queen of the UK prior to Queen of Canada or Grenada is both repetitious and a statement of the obvious. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:23, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

==incomplete Monarchs of Canada list?==
Not sure if this issue has already been raised but here goes...

The article states:
''A list of monarchs of New France, British North America and Canada:''

I don't feel that this list is quite complete as there are several parts of Canada which were under British posession prior to 1763 (the earliest date given in the list for British monarchs).  The date 1534 is given for the beginning of French rule, presumably dated to Cartier's claim, however Cabot's claim (on Newfoundland) is 1497.  Also, Nova Scotia came under Scottish rule from 1621-1632(?), and more specifically, peninsular Nova Scotia came under permanent British rule beginning in 1713.  Therefore I would say that English monarchs from 1497-1707 (date of the Act of Union) are needed, British monarchs 1707-present, as well as Scottish monarchs from 1621-1632(?), however I think these were from England's House of Stewart during this period(?).[[User:Plasma east|Plasma east]] 03:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

== Title ==

The Queen's title is actually ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of Canada and Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth.''

In 1952 it was made clear that 
* each title in each realm uses the format "Queen of {name of country}". The official countryless version was "Queen of this realm"; 
* The United Kingdom has not featured in the royal title outside the UK during the current queen's reign;
* As the royal website makes clear, "Defender of the Faith" is only used in the UK. 

It is depressing when something as basic as the royal title is shown in a monumentally wrong, made-up form in an encyclopædia article.

What's more depressing is when an editor arrogantly assumes he must be correct rather than check his facts. Please see [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/R-12/101374.html the text of the Royal Style and Titles Act] passed by the Canadian parliament and still in force:

Royal Style and Titles Act

CHAPTER R-12

An Act respecting the Royal Style and Titles

Preamble
	

WHEREAS the Prime Ministers and other representatives of Commonwealth countries assembled in London in the month of December, in the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-two, considered the form of the Royal Style and Titles, and recognizing that the present form is not in accordance with present constitutional relations within the Commonwealth, concluded that, in the present stage of development of the Commonwealth relationship, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position that each member country should use for its own purposes a form suitable to its own particular circumstances but retaining a substantial element common to all;

AND WHEREAS the said representatives of all the Commonwealth countries concerned agreed to take such action as is necessary in each country to secure the appropriate constitutional approval for the changes now envisaged;

AND WHEREAS, in order to give effect to the aforesaid conclusions, it is desirable that the Parliament of Canada should assent to the issue of a Royal Proclamation establishing the Royal Style and Titles for Canada:

THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:

Short title
	

1. This Act may be cited as the Royal Style and Titles Act.

Assent to Royal Style and Titles
	

2. The assent of the Parliament of Canada is hereby given to the issue by Her Majesty of Her Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of Canada establishing for Canada the following Royal Style and Titles, namely:

'''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.'''

"As the royal website makes clear, "Defender of the Faith" is only used in the UK."

The title referred to in the article (Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith) is the correct title, and Homey's examples are accurate.  However, it ''is'' the first time a monarch has been titled as Queen of Canada.  The wording of the title is a list of three separate ones: Queen of the UK, Queen of Canada, and Queen of her other Realms and territories.  The Canadian Heritage website specifically refers to this: "Following the untimely death of her father King George VI on February 6, 1952, The Princess Elizabeth acceded to the Throne as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and was separately proclaimed Queen of Canada."

Aren't you the least bit embarrassed about having said "It is depressing when something as basic as the royal title is shown in a monumentally wrong, made-up form in an encyclopædia article," when the title was actually correct until ''you'' changed it?[[User:HOTR|Homey]] 23:04, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

I had a wrong link to a draft bill that was not introduced. You however have been claiming for ages that there is no such title as "Queen of Canada". Explain then why the Act you quote explicitly creates it? It is rather strange that you continue to insist something that your own edit disproves.

::Hm, you also asked me on my talk page: "Where on earth did you get that nonsensical version of the Queen's title for Canada?" despite the fact that I included a hyperlink to my source, the Department of Justice, which you evidently couldn't be bothered to click on. You also made false claims about the use of "Defender of the Faith" and references to the UK in the Queen's title. Was this the fault of your "wrong link" as well? Yet, you have yet to say "oops, I'm sorry, I was wrong". As to your offensive defence, I had stated before there is no such term as "Crown of Canada" and Peter Grey amongst others have backed me up. My reading of the Royal Style and Titles Act is that while it means there is a Queen of Canada (which is what I said earlier in my response to gbambino) there is no explicit title of "Queen of Canada" but clearly my interpretation differs from others, including the government which, as you pointed out, uses the term "Queen of Canada" in the citizenship oath so I'll concede that point. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 23:16, 6 December 2005 (UTC)


I'd say it's not really hair splitting, and the first time there's been a separately titled Queen of Canada is important, both symbolically and legally.  If we edit out the parts of the list that don't matter to this discussion, we're left with: Elizabeth the Second of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen.  We can read this like we would any list, seeing three separate entities: United Kingdom, Canada, and other Realms and territories.  So her one Canadian title calls her Queen of the UK, Queen of Canada, and Queen of her other Realms and territories.  Can Heritage, the Bank of Canada, and the CBC (all govt. organizations) recognise and acknowledge this fact. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 23:10, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== Representing Canada in visits to the United States ==

I believe that when Her Majesty visits the United States, she is usually doing so as Queen of Canada rather than Queen of the United Kingdom.  I'm thinking of when she opened the St. Lawrence Seaway jointly with President Dwight Eisenhower.  Also, I seem to remember seeing pictures of her at the funeral procession for President John F. Kennedy accompanied by the [[Canadian Red Ensign]] (then Canada's flag) rather than the [[Royal Union Flag]]/[[Union Jack]].  However, on their 2005 visit to the United States, the [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Duchess of Cornwall]] did not explicitly represent Canada.  I remember seeing them meeting with President George W. Bush accompanied by the Union Jack rather than the [[Canadian Flag]].--[[User:MarshallStack|MarshallStack]] 22:48, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

:She has made visits as Queen of Canada and as Queen of the United Kingdom. When she visited in 1957, it was as Queen of Canada. When she visited in 1991, it was as Queen of the United Kingdom. I also don't think she came to Kennedy's funeral. The only foreign funeral she has gone to was that of King Baudouin of Belgium. --[[User:Ibagli|Ibagli]] 16:54, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

Also read this report: [[http://www.asithinktank.com/pdf/cafu.pdf]].  An issue of the now-defunct magazine ''Esprit de Corps Canadian Military: Then & Now'' from September, 1991, has a lengthy article by W.B.S. Sutherland on the deleterious effect unification had on the Canadian military's connection with the Crown.  I still have the issue (Vol. 1, Issue 4); I bought it in Windsor in late 1991.--[[User:MarshallStack|MarshallStack]] 06:02, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

*It seems the effect on the relationship between the Crown and military was a side-effect, although certainly a noteworthy one.

== List of Monarchs ==

It's clear that a French line and a British line of monarchs ruled over different parts of Canada over the centuries.  But when it comes to Elizabeth II we have to deal with the fact that the laws making her sovereign of Canada, the laws of succession outlining who inherits the Canadian throne, the laws titling her Queen of Canada, etc., are now all Canadian law, not British.  That means a separate line of succession in Canada, even if it happens to be symmetrical to the UK's. (That each Realm now holds control over succession to its Crown was demonstrated in 1936 when all the Realms passed legislation allowing for George VI to accede to the throne except for Ireland who didn't pass their legislation until a day later - meaning that for one day Edward VIII remained King of Ireland while George VI became king of all the other countries.) So to say that the line of British monarchs still reigns over Canada is incorrect. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 23:11, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

I really don't want to get into the semantics of this again, but perhaps "Commonwealth line" would solve the problem.  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 23:15, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:I'm wondering what exactly is wrong with "Canadian line" -- it is the line as laid out by Canadian constitutional law, effective in Canada only.  What else could it possibly be called? "Commonwealth line," in my mind, doesn't work because a) not all Commonwealth countries share the Queen as head of state, and b) there is no one Commonwealth-wide, overreaching law that sets out the line of succession in every Realm; each Commonwealth Realm has its own laws, with no force or effect in any other Realm.  I looked elsewhere on this page but couldn't find any previous debate about this topic. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 23:35, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

Not this topic specifically, but you'll probably remember that the question of a distinct "Canadian monarchy" has been raised before.  I'm not going to repeat what I wrote at that time, but my objections remain applicable to this debate.  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 23:41, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:Well, your personal objections aside, we have to deal with facts.  Canada's line of succession is laid out in law which is separate to the UK's.  What then do you call that line? --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 23:50, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

(i) My objections were factual, (ii) the "line" refers to more than simply the mechanism of succession.  

''What then do you call that line?''

That would appear to be the question, wouldn't it?  [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 23:57, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

a) is there any consensus among Canadian constitutional scholars that there is now a "Canadian" line in the monarchy.
b) are there even any citable sources that make such a claim.

This seems to be a personal opinion extrapolated from the change in the royal title. I am unaware of any constitutional experts who claim that the change in the Royal Styles and Titles Act has created a new royal lineage (which is what "line" means) - let alone a consensus. In the absence of any citable sources (not original research but an actual source saying there is now a "Canadian line") the claim is POV and original research and does not belong here. [[User:HOTR|Homey]] 00:03, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:It's got nothing to do with the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act and everything to do with the patriation of the Canadian Constitution.  And equally, in the absence of any citable sources, the claim that the line in Canada is still British is POV, original research, and does not belong here. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 00:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
:BTW - Judge Rouleau recognises and speaks about the laws governing succession in Canada as being separate to those in the UK in his O'Donohue ruling.
:This isn't about trying to assert that the Monarchy is Canadian, but that the ''line'' (which is what the section in question is about) in Canada now is.  Or, at least, it is no longer British. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 00:23, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

===Easy solution this time?===

Could we add an asterix after Elizabeth within the "British line", and note the changed mechanism of succession in a footnote? [[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 00:10, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

I've tried a solution with "Shared line between Britain and Canada."  Of course, the line is shared symmetrically with fifteen other countries, but "Shared line between Canada and other Commonwealth Realms" just seems too damn long. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 00:41, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

==Debate on Monarchy in Canada Section==

I suggest moving this section as well as the polls into it's own linked section. The Monarchy in Canada page should focus on the institution itself, it's history and it's present nature , while the debate page can focus on the debate itself between stakeholders. There seems to be enough info in the debate section to merit its own seperate entry. WJRB 15:05, March 9th 2006

== Cost of Crown ==

I deleted the statistic on the cost of the crown per Canadian with the explanation that this was POV; after all, we don't include this sort of statistic for other government expenditures.  Gbambino reverted this edit without the courtesy of an explanation.  My argument still stands.  I realize that the statistic is factual, but I would also point out that in other articles we do not divide expenditures by the number of Canadians.  What reason is there to do so, other than to make the point that the monarchy costs little, which is a POV judgement.  What do others think?  [[User:HistoryBA|HistoryBA]] 21:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:I'd hardly call it a revert without explanation - as I'm sure others will note.  However, if including what the cost was to each person in 2004 contradicts some Wikipedia policy, I'm happy to remove it.  It just seemed like pertinent, and completely NPOV information that readers might find useful. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:21, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:I'm sure you will acknowledge that I explained that I thought the material was POV and that you reverted without explaining why you disagreed.  Could I ask you for the source of the figure.  Did you calculate it yourself?  [[User:HistoryBA|HistoryBA]] 21:31, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

I explained where the number came from, hence it is not my POV, but sourced information.  If you read the report linked in the article [http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf 1], I'm sure you'll see that page one states the population number comes from [[Statistics Canada]]'s Demographic Statistics from October 2004, and the total expenditure on the Crown is calculated in detail through the following 11 pages.  As the conclusion of the report states, the overall cost was approximately $49,000,000, or $1.53 per person.  The UK government has also broken down the head of state expenditures in a similar fashion: [http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4265.asp 2] --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 21:51, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:As I have said, I do not doubt that the information is factual.  The question is whether including it here (when we don't include this sort of statistic on other pages dealing with government expenditures) is inherently POV.  Would you support including a per capita statistic on any page that lists a figure on government expenditures?  Furthermore, I am not sure what your point is on the UK government.  Are you suggesting that the UK government does not have a POV?  [[User:HistoryBA|HistoryBA]] 23:50, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

::I fail to understand how factual, cited information is POV.  Who's point of view precicely is it?  If there exists per capita numbers for other government expenditures, then I'd have no objection to their inclusion.
::Bottom line is, without the per capita breakdown the section still gives a cost for the Crown, so it isn't 100% necessary to give a per person cost.  But, the per person cost is a researched, documented, and published number, so I can't see how it's POV or inadmissable by Wikipedia standards.
::Of course, others may have different opinons, or know something more than me on this matter. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 00:25, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

If it is accurate, if it it relevant and if it is factual then it goes in. That is the rule on content. The content is accurate, relevant and factual. Therefore it belongs in the article.

Though the information is accurate and factual, the Monarchy in Canada article has been a bit of a spring board for various points of view on the monarchy rather than delivering facts in context. If the Cost of the Crown is to be incorporated into the article it should be done in a historical context(compared to past costs), in context of privilages the monarch enjoys, or in context of the such events prompted the enquirey(if the monarchy debate is the context that prompted the enquirey it should be in another article on that debate), it should not be its own section.
--[[User:wjrb|WJRB]] 11:48, 21 March 2006
*The cost of the monarchy comes up in republican criticisms.  The cost should be cited in that context. So it could be considered ever so slightly point-of-view because there's a suggestion that supporting the head of state is an aberration. On the other hand, the money Canadians 'save' by having an absentee Head of State could be considered noteworthy. I guess it could work either way.

== Olaf I of Norway ==

I added some information regarding the Norse settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], and it being the first North American colony settled by subjects of a non-indigenous king: [[Olaf I of Norway]].  As the kings of France who established other colonies in present day Canada are listed as Monarchs of Canada, would Olaf I count as well?  The Norse colony only lasted three years, but would it technically still count? --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 17:07, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
*I think it would depend on whether the colony was an entirely private venture of people who were ethnically Norse, or was a venture of the Norwegian (Icelandic?) government.  Now, most colonization was neither strictly what we would now call public sector nor strictly private sector, but in the case of L'Anse aux Meadows, I'm not convinced the government in Norway even knew about it.

I disagree I found it by mistake but found myself reading it all and I learnt lots about the monarchy in Canada that I did not know before. Please dont reduce it, this info is not really available anywhere else that I have seen.

==Monarchs of Canada==

Gbambino, who rules this page with an iron fist, wants the list of "monarchs of Canada" to include every King of England and France who have existed while any part of what later became "Canada" was colonized. If one is to make a list of "Monarchs of Canada" and not simply "Monarchs who have presided over the colonization of North America" it seems to me that the list must begin in 1867, when Canada became a country. There was no "Canada" in the 1500's, so it seems rather spurious to identify someone as being "monarch of Canada" for that time period. [[User:J.J.|J.J.]] 21:55, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
:Very good point. Perhaps we should rename this page to Monarchy in British North America and create a new page for Monarchy in Canada? [[User:W00p|W00p]] 22:09, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

As it clearly says, the list is "A list of monarchs of New France, British North America and Canada" (and, no, Iron Fist himself did not write that).  The first one in the list, Francis I, established French colonies in Acadia and '''Canada''' (again, not written by yours truly).  So, unless you want to deny the existence of the colonies and territories known as Canada ([[New France#Early exploration|"The vast territories that were to be known as Acadia and Canada were..."]]), [[The Canadas]], and the [[Province of Canada]], I trust you'll reinstate the chart as it existed previously.  If you really object to this, you'll have to push for the renaming of [[Canada under British Imperial Control (1764-1867)]], and a heavy editing of [[History of Canada]], [[French Canadian]], [[United Empire Loyalists]], [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)]], [[British North America]], [[Quebec Act]], [[Post-Confederation Canada (1867-1914)]], and so on, all of which often speak of "Canada" as existing in some form or another prior to 1867. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 22:40, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

Legally though there was no Canada until 1867, and as such no Monarch of what is today recognized as Canada. Sure Canada existed in other forms before, but by that same token you could create a "Kings of the United States" page and throw George the Third on and such. It's ''technically'' true that there have been King's of what later became the United States of America, but it wouldn't really make any sense. If JJ really wanted to get bitchy he could just delete everything up until when Lizzie became Queen, since she's the first ''legal'' Queen of Canada if I recall correctly. Regardless, JJ's in the right here (as usual).  --[[User:24.68.182.5|24.68.182.5]] 09:20, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:Two republicans agreeing does not the right answer make.  In fact, Anon., you've refused to address the point that various Wikipedia articles make reference to Canada existing in one form or another prior to 1867 (post 1867 is a moot debate - the country was considered a kingdom by the Fathers of Confederation despite still being a dominion of the British Crown).  That means there were monarchs over territory known as Canada since the 1500s, though not necessarily over Canada as the modern nation we know today.
:In fact, it's not only Wikipedia.  Senator Serge Joyal, and the Senate itself, seems to think there were monarchs of Canada before Confederation, else wise, why would there be portraits of kings from before 1867 hanging in the Royal portrait gallery outside the Senate in Ottawa?  Note this [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate/Monarchy/SenMonarchy_00-e.htm information from the Senate] says "Since 1534, when the King of France claimed possession of what is now Canada, the history of our country has been marked by the reigns of an uninterrupted succession of monarchs, both French and British, who have had a significant influence on our country's development."  The [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate/Monarchy/SenMonarchy_01-e.htm list], from the same source, of Canadian monarchs begins with Francois I.
:Also, this [http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf educational pamphlet] from the Department of Canadian Heritage states: "Canada has long been a monarchy - under the kings of France in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, under the British Crown in the 18th and 19th centuries, and as a kingdom in her own right from Confederation onward."
:Personally, I'd rather go by the official sources than simply what John (J.J.) asserts. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 16:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

You have a rather odd tendency to defer to authority rather than facts. The facts are quite clear: There was no "Canada" proper until 1867. Ergo there was no "Monarch" of Canada, King of Canada, Duke of Canada, Prime Minister of Canada, President of Canada, or anything else "of Canada" until Canada proper existed. Since you bring it up, I'm frankly not a fan of other historical writings that claim "Canada" existed prior to 1867 either, for example, those who claim that "Canada" fought the US in the 1812 War. It's revisionist history. There was Upper / Lowe Canada, and the United Province of Canada, but frankly I resent the implication that the history of those places is the history "of Canada" since they represented only a portion of what the country is today. 

I have no problem with a list of "Monarchs of Canada," but if that title is to be used it seems revisionist to list a bunch of French and English monarchs who had nothing to do with the state of Canada as it exists today. The other guy makes a good point, one could just as easily make lengthy lists of "Monarchs of the United States" or "Monarchs of Ghana" etc with similar logic. But no one would consider such lists meaningful or factually accurate. [[User:J.J.|J.J.]] 23:16, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:Usually authorities are a good source of facts - it's why we cite sources at Wikipedia, and not just insert what we believe to be true, as seems to be your editing fashion, John.  If you don't believe that the history of Canada extends beyond 1867, so be it - but your "facts" don't reflect what the majority (including experts, or "authorities") think to be true.
:Nobody's claiming the previous monarchs are Canadians themselves, only that they were French and British kings and queens ruling and later reigning over land which was called Canada, and which evolved to become modern Canada.  This isn't a radical observation, or "revisionist history" as you put it.
:Of course we can't speak of monarchs of the United States because there was no such thing as the United States before that nation came into existence through rebellion - a violent break from the Crown.  Canada, on the other hand, emerged from evolution, which, not coincidentally, happened under an unbroken reign of successive monarchs.
:Whether or not you like authority, in the absence of any real claim against it, we have to stick to the available facts.  If you can come up with a credible historian who claims that Canada's monarchical heritage begins only in 1867, well, we'll have to acknowledge that contradictory theory.  If you can't, then we can't pretend that it exists. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 18:54, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

You can't be serious; that doesn't even validate your next statement that the Kings / Queens were in "possession of what is now Canada". The operative words being "what is now". The article refers to the Canadian monarchy in the ''contemporary'' sense, (and I'm certain Gavin will be at pains to tell us that it is indeed now a ''Canadian Monarchy'' and not a British one) hence you cannot simply tack on all and sundry monarchs with some claim to ''what is now'' Canada.

For a table of Canadian Heads of State, Henry VII and Francis I would certainly be out of place, but the table is simply describing Monarchs who have ruled over the territory which is now Canada.  
The creation of the Dominion of Canada was not a radical break in constitutional continuity the way the Rebellion in what is now the United States was.  Canada's history has been largely characterized by gradual change.  Francis I was king over the territory of Canada in one sense, Henry IV would have a much stronger claim as sovereign over Canada (there are statues of him to this day), and Elizabeth II was the only one to actually be crowned as Queen of Canada. Most English Canadians think of Canada as existing, in one evolving form or another, from the colonizing by the Loyalist diaspora.  Then French Canadians laugh because actually half of Canada's history had already happened by then. [[User:Peter Grey|Peter Grey]] 03:23, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Gavin - Regardless indeed: This isn't Common Cause at work, the article is objectively about the Monarchy in Canada.

I note that the British Monarchy is [[List of monarchs in the British Isles|so divided]].

:Yes.  In Canadian English, spelling "organize" with an "s" isn't a style choice; it's wrong.  It's also frankly rather affected.  Canadian English doesn't use British spellings &mdash; Canadian English uses Canadian spellings, some of which ("colour") are the same as the British spellings and others of which ("initialize") are the same as the American spellings.  As this article is about the Queen of Canada and not the Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Canadian spelling really should be used.

==This Article is Embarassing==

"Defender of the Faith"? Please, what nonsense. I think the governor-general dropped that title the last time I looked at the Web site. Some empirical aspects of the monarchy would be useful; and much less of the anachronistic nonsense.--[[User:Lance6968|Lance6968]] 07:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

:The Governor General could never have "dropped that title" as the Governor General never held that title.  I think you'll have to have a slow and concentrated read of this article again, and hopefully it'll become clear that "Defender of the Faith" is part of the ''Queen's'' current title.  If you feel it's anachronistic then please write to the Privy Council office and recommend that they alter the [[Royal Style and Titles Act]]. --[[User:Gbambino|gbambino]] 18:17, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

==Clever example of POV and Weasel Words==

I realize that this is a quotation: "The Canadian Crown continues as a key element of our parliamentary democracy and an enduring symbol that represents all generations of Canadians and the best that is our country" and in one place it is cited as such. In another, it is not, and hence constitutes the clearest possible example of [[pov]] and the use of [[weasel words]]. Well, the end of it "represents...the best that is our country" certainly is.  --[[User:Ggbroad|Ggbroad]] 17:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:I'm somewhat flattered you think it was clever on my part, but in reality it was just an error when I inserted the quoted block text here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_in_Canada&diff=95763616&oldid=95562091].

She reminded me of my aunt Nancy, except that aunt Nancy doesn't claim to reign over me because of [[God]].) It's not good. Stress kills. There are times where I feel like [[Winston Smith]], y'know? That I should just give in and say, "okay, two and two is five" and be done with it and be happy. Anyway, sorry. Not meaning to disrupt the talk page for this quite fine article. Just feeling punchy today.--[[User:Ggbroad|Ggbroad]] 18:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
::Well, not that it'll probably change your opinion on the matter, but it should at least be pointed out that EIIR has never claimed to reign over Canada because some god said she could.  In the end it's the Constitution that makes her Queen of Canada.  Whether the whole birth thing has to do with deities is another matter, but even if you consider that a valid point, she's then Queen of Canada through a partnership between god and our law-makers.  I think the full [[divine right of kings]] ended sometime around the [[Magna Carta]]. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 19:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Obviously there is some point here that I have misunderstood, as I understand her to be styled: "Elizabeth the Second, by ''the Grace of God'', of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith". Now if that's not a claim that God is somehow involved in the fact that she is our Queen, then I don't know what it is. I suppose at this point one could argue that, if you believe in God, he's somehow involved in every terrestrial matter, in which case that "by Grace of God" business is, at best, functionally redundant. But, again, I'm sure the misunderstanding is mine.--[[User:Ggbroad|Ggbroad]] 19:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:Mmm, it seems like our politicians do consider themselves in partnership with God when it comes to law-making; the preamble to the Charter is "Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law," and the Queen didn't make up her own title, the "Grace of God" thing comes from the Royal Style and Titles Act - a Canadian law passed in 1953. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 19:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
::Oh, but come now. It's not as though that phrase "by Grace of God" emerged intact from the minds of Canadian Parliamentarians in 1953. Clearly the suggestion that there is some kind of destinarian program involved in the selection of the monarch runs very deep: after all the name of the song (which I am just old enough to remember singing in Ontario classrooms) ain't "Parliamentary Procedure Save The Queen".--[[User:Ggbroad|Ggbroad]] 20:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
:Hah! No, but her title really is a matter for parliamentarians, not her alone, or even God itself. Perhaps I'm simply trying to say that God seems to still run very deep within more of our government than simply the Queen, and it's the politicians who put it there. Possibly as our government becomes more and more secular, the references to God will disappear, even from the Royal Title. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 20:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

==NPOV==
This talk page is filled with objections to the POV of this article. [[User:Jonawiki|Jonawiki]] 18:06, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

==Examples of Horrifying Compliance to Attribution in this Article==
I randomly backtracked the closest footnote for a random assortment of statements in the article. The footnotes did NOT mention any of the following statements. And this was a cursory random sample. This is a joke.

Please provide the source for the following facts and assertions:
* The Balfour Declaration of 1926 provided the dominions the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each Realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the dominions were secondary.
* In addition to the Queen's role in each of her Realms, the Canadian Monarch is also the nominal Head of the Commonwealth. Though this title does not imply any political power over member nations, and does not automatically belong to the monarch, only the shared monarch of the Commonwealth Realms has ever held this title.
* Since the death of Queen Anne in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch "reigns" but does not "rule". In Canada, this has been true since the Treaty of Paris (1763) ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King Louis XV of France.
* Succession to the throne is by male-preference primogeniture, and governed by the provisions of the Act of Settlement, as well as the English Bill of Rights. These documents, though originally passed by the Parliament of England, are now part of Canadian constitutional law, under control of the Canadian parliament only.
* The Sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice," and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. 
* In Canada major public inquiries are called Royal Commissions, and are created by the Cabinet on behalf of the Monarch through a Royal Warrant.
* The Royal Union Flag remains an official flag in Canada, though a distinctly Canadian flag was adopted in 1964 as the National Flag.
*  In 1977, Prince Charles visited Alberta to attend celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing. During a subsequent visit by his mother in 1994, a modern demonstration of the relationship between the First Nations and the Crown was seen when the Dene community of the Northwest Territories presented a list of grievances over stalled land claim negotiations to Queen Elizabeth II, rather than to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, while the two were attending an Aboriginal Cultural Festival in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.
* Cities under Royal Charter are not subject to municipal Acts of parliament applied generally to other municipalities, and instead are governed by legislation applicable to each city individually. 
* To date, there has been little national debate about ending the Monarchy in Canada, in contrast to some other Commonwealth Realms where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile.
* The Victoria Cross is the highest decoration in the Canadian honours system. Its motto "For Valour" was adopted on the recommendation of Queen Victoria

==Request for Comments: Length, Neutrality, Attribution==
This is a dispute about whether this article has appropriate length, neutrality and attribution. 18:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

;Statements by editors previously involved in dispute

*This article is far too long, going into too much detail because of the vanity involved. Per [[WP:Size]], articles generally should try to stay under 32 KB. This article is more than DOUBLE that at 73 KB. I feel the article is too filled with [[WP:NOT#IINFO | indiscriminate information]] and [[WP:TRIVIA | trivia]]. 
*It lacks NPOV, ghettoizing controversy and criticism to a separate article and asserting that Canadians don't have any strong feelings against the monarchy. Just read all the objections over NPOV on this talk page above and in the archives. 
*It lacks sufficient attribution. There's a huge amount of data, facts, figures, processes explained and opinions that cannot be tied back to the footnotes in the References section. Check out all the fact tags I placed throughout the article. [[User:Jonawiki|Jonawiki]] 18:20, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::On the contrary, the facts are very clear. A number of leading Canadians wanted it to be a kingdom, but this was rejected by the British government (though the allegation that this was to appease the Americans is uncited, I notice). In short, Canada is ''not'' a kingdom, because this proposal was specifically rejected. These people, of course, were charting new territory. The precedent was later followed with Australia and the other dominions. And my last question is for G2bambino - if you wish to call Canada a kingdom in a practical sense (if not in law), then please go ahead.

::"The impugned positions of the Act of Settlement are an integral part of the rules of succession that govern the selection of the monarch of Great Britain. By virtue of our constitutional structure whereby Canada is [not was--'''is'''] united under the Crown of Great Britain, the same rules of succession must apply for the selection of the King or Queen of Canada and the King or Queen of Great Britain."

::In the same case Her Majesty in Rights of Canada and Ontario argued:  1.) The remedy sought will have no practical effect since it cannot affect the legislation in the United Kingdom [the monarchy is beyond the scope of Canadian law] and 2.) The respondents also maintain that the applicant does not have a genuine interest in the issue and that the matter would more properly be brought before the English courts.

I don't know where anyone's getting their ideas regarding taking issues of a Canadian nature to the English courts; for more than 80 years now the English courts have been directing Canadian issues back to Canada; they have no jurisdiction over us.

::In the most basic sense, she does: the Constitution essentially makes her the Government of Canada.

The location of the Queen means nothing to this fact, nor does the application of the term "Dominion" (which was supposedly chosen for its equally monarchical connotations).

::A linguistics professor once taught me that no two words ever have exactly the same meaning.  I suspect that most English speakers would avoid the word ''kingdom'' with regard to Canada but would be perfectly comfortable describing it as one of Elizabeth II's realms.  Why, for example, did parliament choose ''realm'' over ''kingdom''?  Why do we refer to Commonwealth realms and not Commonwealth kingdoms? The two words are not equivalent, and, in the mind of that linguistics professor at UQAM (whose name I unfortunately cannot recall), they can't be.

Not only does Canada not have one, it's monarch delegates her responsibilities with respect to Canada to a viceroy, while the monarch herself tends to the affairs of another country.

:Realm and kingdom are synonymous; realm itself derives from the French ''royaume'', which has it's root in the French word ''roi'' for king.  Why, in 1953, the PM's chose "...her other Realms and Territories" over "...her other Kingdoms and Territories," I don't know.  But, if by usage the United Kingdom is itself one of the Queen's realms and is still a kingdom, then Canada can be both as well.  Further, it doesn't matter where the monarch resides or who they deligate to act in their absence: Scotland didn't cease to be a kingdom when James I & VI moved to England; nor was Norway any less of a kingdom when its monarch resided in Sweden. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 22:12, 18 July 2007 (UTC)

== Canadian kingdom ==

Canada is in fact a kingdom.  There is the Queen of Canada, who is [[Elizabeth II]].  As we know, she is also the Queen of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].  These are separate titles, like the [[Queen of Australia]] title and [[Queen of New Zealand]].  

The argument above, as I said before, is ridiculous.  It's an argument over semantics.  Elizabeth II, for Canada, should actually be called Queen Elizabeth I, (and as she is, in Britain Elizabeth II, much like in past history, where one monarch has had different numbered names.  I believe it was James I of England who was James V in Scotland).  

This was an argument over semantics, particularly the mess that we saw towards the bottom of the last section.  Hopefully this will be considered resolved.  --[[User:Son|myselfalso]] 18:44, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

== Oaths of allegiance ==

The parliamentarians' oath in the Constitution Act 1867 makes no mention of Canada, indeed, it explicitly states that it is the name of the King or Queen of the U.K. that one swears allegiance to:

''I A.B. do swear, That I will be faithful and bear true Allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria.

Note. The Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the Time being is to be substituted from Time to Time, with proper Terms of Reference thereto.''

Paliament did not change that section when it renamed the act at the time the constitution was patriated.

Furthermore, the Citizenship Act allows the relevant minister to waive the oath requirement for minors and certain people with disabilities.

If you want to use the old "the Constitution Act says 'Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'" argument, then you're essentailly trying to assert that the Oath of Allegiance sworn by parliamentarians is to nobody; the Monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ceased to exist in 1927.

=== Peter Phillips: member of the royal family? ===

This article currently states that [[Autumn Kelly]] is about to marry into the Canadian Royal Family. According to the [[British Royal Family]] article, though, [[Peter Mark Andrew Phillips|Peter Phillips]] is not a member of the ''British'' Royal Family, by the most common definition (note, not a legal one). And however separate one might argue these two Royal Families to be, doesn't it make sense that at least they should have the same ''members''? -- [[User:Jao|Jao]] 14:13, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

:The Royal Family is composed only of The Queen and princes and princesses bearing the style of Royal Highness. Peter Phillips is not a member of any royal family, he is an untitled commoner. [[User talk:Charles|Charles]] 23:32, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

::Well, there's an official royal family - of which the Canadian and British do differ slightly - and then there's the royal family that consists of extended relations of the monarch.  As [[British Royal Family]] states: "there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family." Peter Phillips does not bear a royal style, however he is 10th in line to the throne, and the grandson of the reigning monarch.  Plus, the engagement was announced by Buckingham Palace, and the marriage will be a royal one.
::Upon further reflection, though, the marriage of Sylvana Jones to the Earl of St Andrews seems a little more hazy.  The Earl is the son of a prince who carries out official duties on behalf of the Queen and is a Counsellor of State; but, I'm not sure he'll become one on the death of his father, when he inherits the [[Duke of Kent|Dukedom of Kent]]. So, I'm not sure if the Earl, a great-grandchild of George V, would be considered a member of the Royal Family. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 00:01, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:::He may be a member of an extended royal family, but he is not a member of the Royal Family. He is not royalty. [[User talk:Charles|Charles]] 00:10, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

::::So, as a member of the extended Royal Family why would he not, then, be mentioned in a section about the Royal Family? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 00:14, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::Because that is chiefly a informal extension of the term and it is nothing but that, informal. Any formal notion of a Royal Family is composed of members who are royalty. Peter Phillips is not royalty; he is not royal. I, for instance, am a member of my maternal grandmother's family, but I am not a member of the Smith family (her maiden name isn't Smith, just an example). [[User talk:Charles|Charles]] 00:20, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::Sorry, I'm not getting your argument.  He's a member of the Royal Family, he's tenth in line to the Throne, his engagement was announced by Buckingham Palace, his wedding will be a royal one, but he's not a royal? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 00:27, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:''(After a pause, essentially the same discussion resumed in what was originally the next section down. The two moots then briefly went on in parallel, but have been merged, below -- [[User:Lonewolf BC|Lonewolf BC]] 19:59, 12 August 2007 (UTC))''

What is the basis for the claim that Peter Phillips is not a member of the royal family, which is being used as a reason to remove the reference to his up-coming wedding to a Canadian?  Forgive my saying so, but it seems completely outlandish to claim that the Queen's first grandchild is not a member of the royal family.  How close, then, must one be?  And more importantly, who says so?  In the lack of some explanation and authoritative source to support this point, I can see not excuse for eliminating the material.  CBC's "The National" is a pretty reliable source.  In fact, everything I can find, just in some quick internet searching, is consistent in making this out to be wedding in the royal family.  Is it perhaps Phillip's lack of any royal style or title that brings about these remarkable claims?  If so, that is not at all the same thing as not being a member of the royal family.  Please provide some backing for this claim.  Otherwise, please stop reverting the article on its basis. -- [[User:Lonewolf BC|Lonewolf BC]] 02:42, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:The basis is HE IS NOT ROYALTY. How can you say that because he is the first grandchild, or that he is tenth in line, that he is royalty? If the first 7G grandchild of Victoria was born untitled, would he or she be royalty? First born means nothing until you have a title in that family that you are a member of the Royal Family. It is a wedding of someone closely related to the Royal Family, but not a member of it, sorry. He is not a prince, he is not a Royal Highness and '''he is not royalty'''. Members of Royal families are royalty. Repetition of error or sloppiness doesn't make something correct, as I noted with the same sources referring to Diana as "Princess Diana". These claims are not remarkable, or even outlandish. Your support of the astounding error is though. [[User talk:Charles|Charles]] 02:52, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

::I'll repeat here what I asked above:

::::So you keep saying, but have yet to provide definitive proof to support your claim.  Of course, there's little to no definitive proof to say he is a royal either, but there's certainly more evidence that says he is than says he's not. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 03:58, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::Little to no proof saying he is royal is a very good start. The proof, however, is in the pudding: He is a female-line descendant of a sovereign and as such is not royal. It was for the same reason that [[Princess Maud of Fife]] and [[Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife]] were purposefully given titles, styles and precedence: they were previously not royalty! Their grandfather had wanted them to be. However, the incident of birth to a princess of the blood and a non-royal father obviously complicated the matter. [[User talk:Charles|Charles]] 04:04, 13 August 2007 (UTC) 

::::Yet you continue to focus on the necessity of titles to make someone a member of the Royal Family.  As stated elsewhere, [[Angus Ogilvy]] did not hold any royal title but was still considered a member of the Royal Family, at least in Canada. Thus, a title or style of Royal Highness is not necessary to make someone a royal. This is what I meant earlier about an extended royal family beyond the "official" one. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 04:12, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::::Gee weez; if Elizabeth II, Charles, William, Henry, Andrew, Beatrice, Eugene, Edward, Louise, (Sophia & thus unborn child) & Anne were to be suddenly 'killed' simultaneously -- We'd have a non-royal King Peter.

At that point he'll undisputably a non-royal. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] 19:23, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::::No, he would not be a non-royal king. The moment his mother or he becomes queen/king, he will instantaneously become royal as either the child of a sovereign or sovereign himself. He is indisputably not a royal right now. My "beef" is with the prominence and inaccurate wording given to a Canadian marrying a non-royal British man. A Canadian is marrying a queen's maternal grandson, but she is not marrying into royalty. [[User talk:Charles|Charles]] 21:08, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

----
''Replying to Charles', "The basis is HE IS NOT ROYALTY....[etc.]"''<br>Charles, you seem to be arguing that that:<blockquote>a) Only people who have a royal title are royalty, and<br>b) Phillips lacks a royal title. Therefore:<br>c) Phillips is not royalty.<br>d) People who are not royalty are not members of the royal family, and<br>c) Phillips is not royalty. Therefore:
<br>e) Phillips is not a member of the royal family.</blockquote>That is impeccable logic, formally, but the argument fails because the world evidently does not grant some its premises.  It is also problematic in that the middle portion is needless and only serves to obscure matters, equivocally:  "Royalty" means various things in various contexts.  I suppose that in some contexts it might mean people having royal titles.  In other contexts it means members of the royal family.  To assume that those two meanings are identical only begs the question.  Cutting out the needless and troublesome bridge through "royalty", then, your argument is that:<blockquote>a) Only people who have a royal title are members of the royal family, and<br>b) Phillips has not have a royal title. Therefore:<br>c) Phillips is not a member of the royal family.</blockquote>The second premise is a matter of plain fact (and could readily be referenced, though there is no need because no one is questioning its truth).  The argument's flaw is that its first premise has not been demonstrated.  Indeed, it seems to be no more than your personal opinion.  Further, it seems to be at odds with the view of the world at large, whereas the international press has uniformly presented this upcoming marriage as a wedding in the royal family.  You must ''support'' your first premise -- and do so by finding reliable sources that assert it, not by making "original research" arguments based on other information.<p>Keep in mind, too, that "royal family" itself does not have just one, definitive meaning, but may mean different things in different contexts.  There ''might'' be some particular formal definition whereby its means exclusively people with royal titles, but that does not make it ''wrong'' to use the term in a broader sense.  I think that the commonsense understanding of the term is that it simply means members of the family of the monarch (where "family", itself, has a variable breadth of meaning, depending on context).  It is altogether ordinary to regard a person's grandchildren as members of their family, and by that token Phillips is a member of the Queen's family, which is to say a member of the royal family.  However, what matters is that sources are uniformly presenting Phillips' upcoming wedding as a marriage in the royal family.  In order to edit the article contrariwise, you need ''sources'' saying the contrary.  Your personal opinion, and your personal interpretations of other facts, are not good enough. -- [[User:Lonewolf BC|Lonewolf BC]] 05:11, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

=== Other editorial points ===

"Fact" tag: other WP articles are not acceptable references.  I added tag ''here'' b/c ''this'' was the article I was editing, not one ot the others, but if references are given for this on those unreferenced articles, I would be fine with lifting the tag, here.  I don't particularly doubt the fact, but merely think that it needs a reference, either here or on the articles that are more concerned with it

"Sylvana Jones": It was "Sylvana Jones" who married the earl.  She only became "Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews" ''upon'' marrying him.  There is nothing wrong with letting a redirect handle linkage to the article of that latter title.  That's what redirects are for, and they are preferred to piping, where they exist.

Other changes are just a matter of writing style -- what ''makes'' the best "flow.  If disagreed with, suggest calling for a 3rd opinion. -- [[User:Lonewolf BC|Lonewolf BC]] 23:10, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

:It is my understanding - from watching the editing of others - that redirects are to be avoided in favour of piped links.  I'm not positive why, but I've seen it done countless times, and I imagine it's for more organized interlinking w/in Wikipedia.  I've certainly never seen someone purposefully replace a piped link with a redirect to the page the piped link originally went to.
:Currently, the flow of the sentences is disjointed.  In order, they talk about: 1) 1st marriage, 2) 2nd marriage, 3) 1st marriage.

::I'll check about piping versus redirects.  I might be mistaken.<br>About the wording, I think it makes better sense to begin with a summary sentence (one marriage, plus one in the offing), and then give the details of the two cases, in turn, in their order of mention (which is also their order in time), in the two following sentences.  To me, this seems like the clearest and most logical way to organise this brief paragraph.  It is also a common and commonly recommended way of organising paragraphs and of organising written works on a larger scale -- tell 'em what you're going to tell 'em about, then tell 'em about it.  This particular paragraph is so short that its organisation is not overly critical, but the principle is helpful to clear presentation, even so. -- [[User:Lonewolf BC|Lonewolf BC]] 00:14, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

::[[WP:PIPE]] says, "It is not necessary to pipe links simply to avoid redirects."  It goes on to explain a potential benefit of having a redirect, rather than a piped link.

== Right Honourable ==

For some reason the fact that some members of the Royal Family have been styled The Right Honourable seems to be in question. Sir Angus Ogilvy was included in the Department of Canadian Heritage's list of Royal Family members, and he was styled "The Right Honourable." [http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/_17_e.cfm] --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 01:20, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

==Merovingians==

Whilst it is certainly true that the Queen has a collateral descent from the Merovingians, she also has a similarly convoluted descent from the early dynasties of every single other European country and probably half of the Middle Eastern ones as well. In other words, why have the Merovingians been singled out for mention? [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 17:43, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::No. That page doesn't mention the Merovingians. Why mention them here? [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 17:53, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

:::Probably because the Canadian monarchy, as opposed to the British one, has a large number of French-speaking subjects, for whom the fact that their queen is descended from "French" kings might be more interesting than the same about "English" kings. I think that's the justification, although I don't really see it as a valid one, for the reasons you state above. Elizabeth is of course not the French-Canadians' queen because she's descended from "French" kings; whether they like it or not, she is their queen because she's descended from "English" kings. Also, the scare quotes here are really huge: there is certainly not an obvious chain going from the Franks to the Québécois. -- [[User:Jao|Jao]] 18:05, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::::It does indeed seem to be pushing an agenda. Why not appease the Muslims in Canada in a similar way by pointing out that the Queen is descended from Muhammad, or rally the support of goths by telling them that Prince Charles is descended from Dracula (i.e. Vlad the Impaler)?

[[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 18:23, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::One simple reason: Muhammad never ruled over Canadian territories.  French kings did.
::It does indeed seem that [[British monarchy]] never mentioned Merovingians; I remembered copying some text from there, but forgot I'd augmented it when inserting it here; looking back through the edit history of both articles has reminded me.
::If I recall correctly, I did insert it because there's an ancestral link between EIIR and French monarchs; but, more important than that, was the point that large swaths of Canada were once part of the French Empire, and were directly handed over to George III.  Thus, there is another link between the present day Canadian Crown and the old French Crown.  The section currently spells it out in this way. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 18:37, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

:::Well, if the Canadian monarch were descended from someone who ruled (as King of France) over territory in present-day Canada, that might be worth a mention, just like how one might mention how the later [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte]] kings descend from the older Swedish dynasties: it may be a coincidence, but it's noticeable still. But as it stands now, it really only says that the present Canadian monarch and the [[Early Modern France|early modern]] French monarchs share a common ancestor, which is pretty much a given, so I'm with TharkunColl on this. I totally subscribe to your view that he was too trigger-happy, though. Let people have their say before going at it. -- [[User:Jao|Jao]] 19:54, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::Perhaps it needs finessing then.  I'm not an expert on royal lineage, so perhaps someone can offer greater detail, but the following might be a start:
:::''The current Canadian [[monarchy]] can trace its ancestral lineage back to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period, and ultimately back to the [[List of kings of the Angles|kings of the Angles]] and early [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish kings]]; parts of the territories that today comprise Canada were claimed under Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1583. Other lands were claimed in 1534 by King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], who's lineage was rooted in the [[Merovingian]] period, back to the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish kingdom]] of [[Clovis I]], and who is also a distant ancestor of the present Canadian monarch. Throughout the 18th century, via war and treaties, the [[New France|Canadian colonies of France]] were ceded to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].  The [[Canadian Confederation|colonies were confederated]] by Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in 1867 to form [[Canada]] as a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in its own right,<ref name="Heritage">{{cite web|url= http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf |title=The Crown in Canada }}&nbsp;{{small|(376&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}</ref> and the country was proclaimed a fully independent, via [[Constitution Act, 1982|constitutional patriation]], by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1982.''
::I think this more clearly spells out the two links that exist to the Merovingians, but gives due emphasis to that which is created by the transfer of Canadian territories from one crown to the other.

There is still no logical reason to single out the Merovingians. The early medieval kings of France, through the same process of international royal intermarriage, were themselves descended from the Anglo-Saxon kings. So if you're looking for a common ancestor, you could just as easily look to the Anglo-Saxons. So again, why single out the merovingians, and specifically Clovis? Why not, say, [[Cerdic of Wessex]]? [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 21:27, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

In any case, [[Hugh Capet]] was the first true king of France, not Clovis. [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 21:35, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

Also... the Queen is descended from the kings and lords of the Vikings, some of whom colonised part of Canada long before the French. [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 21:44, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

:The Viking thing has come up earlier.  It was established, though, that the Norse who settled in Newfoundland were actually from Iceland, which then had no monarch, and essentially set out on their own without warrant from any chiefly leader.  So, there doesn't appear to be any link between Viking kings and the modern crown via Norse settlers in Canada.
:As for lineages of both the current Monarch and the monarchs of France, Wikipedia seems vague on where, if ever, they meet. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 22:14, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

There has been intermarriage between the kings of England and France since at least the 10th century, so both monarchies are descended from both the Anglo-Saxons and the Merovingians. However, there has been no intermarriage for a few hundred years, because of the religious divide. [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 22:36, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

:There is no proven Merovingian descent to anybody, though there is much conjecture.  The descents given in Holy Blood Holy Grail / Da Vinci Code are fantasies based on recently and badly forged documents.  The most detailed scholarly studies are by the French genealogist Christian Settipani, who has reviewed several conjectures and come up with a few more, all more or less plausible.  But, as he himself stresses, he has only studied possibilities:  nothing whatsoever can be proven. --[[User:Chris Bennett|Chris Bennett]] 01:48, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I was under the impression that the Carolingians (and hence the Capetians) could, by intermarriage, claim a Merovingian descent; but having looked into it, you're right - there is no documented connection. So we must scrap all references to the Merovingians. It seems that the intention was to include the earliest known common ancestor of the English and French monarchies, and for this purpose I would suggest [[Cerdic of Wessex]], who lived around AD 500 (a near contemporary of Clovis), founded the Kingdom of Wessex in England, and is thus the ancestor of the kings of England and (through much later intermarriage) of the kings of France as well. [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 09:02, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:Some Anglo-Saxonists(?) are unconvinced that the connection between Egbert and earlier kings of Wessex (or, for others, between Ine and earlier kings of Wessex) given in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is authentic; some are doubtful that Cerdic is a historical character.  (IMO he was -- the name is Celtic -- but his connection to later kings of Wessex is perhaps a little doubtful; the ASC itself has two different accounts.)  Certainly, much of this genealogy is unverifiable.

:The earliest common ancestor is probably Welsh or Irish, depending on your view of the accuracy of Welsh and Irish chronicles.  --[[User:Chris Bennett|Chris Bennett]] 14:52, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::There is no reason to assume that the Welsh and Irish chronicles are any more or less accurate than the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (though interestingly the Welsh chronicle of Nennius preserves many of the Anglo-Saxon genealogies that match those of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 15:36, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

::Is there a way to resolve this, then?  Is there a link from EIIR back to both Elizabeth I and Francis I, at least, from which the line would then split to the earliest known French and British/Welsh/Irish kings? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 15:01, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::There is no descent from Francis I of France to Elizabeth II of the UK because of the religious divide between the two countries that prevented further intermarriage from the 16th century onwards. There is equally no descent from Elizabeth I of England to her current namesake because she was childless. However, all share a common ancestor. Many, many common ancestors in fact. Such as [[Alfred the Great]] of England. But you have stated that you only want to include "French and British/Welsh/Irish kings". May I ask why you don't want to include any English ones?  [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 15:05, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

::It's not obvious to me why the point has any relevance at all to this particular article.  Be that as it may, the earliest king of either of what later became France and Britain who is unquestionably a common ''ancestor'' to Francis I and Elizabeth I is Pepin the Short, Charlemagne's father. --[[User:Chris Bennett|Chris Bennett]] 15:47, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::[[Ethelbert of Kent]] married Bertha, a Merovingian princess, some time before AD 596. So perhaps a Merovingian descent amongst the English kings is not out of the question. [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 15:54, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

::David Kelley has proposed a very reasonable conjectural ancestry based on this marriage.  But the operative word in your comment is '''perhaps'''.

See [[Descent from antiquity]].  --[[User:Chris Bennett|Chris Bennett]] 16:01, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:The point that I belive has relevance is where the origins of the present Canadian monarchy lie.  Of course there's a path back to the roots of the present British monarchy, but within the Canadian context there's also the added presence of French monarchs.  I'm just trying to reconcile them all, for lack of a better term.  Perhaps the both of you, with clearly more knowledge on the subject than I, could propose a composition that would be both accurate and pertinent? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 16:20, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

But the French monarchs of the 16th - 18th centuries have no institutional connection with the English/British monarchy, and it is from the latter that the Canadian monarchy solely and exclusively derives. To make mention of remote ancestors in common is to seriously misrepresent the completely separate development of the English and French kingdoms going back for a millennium and a half - and far from having a common origin, the two kingdoms were wholly separate and created by completely unrelated people - it was only later intermarriage that made their rulers related. Although they came close once or twice, England and France have never shared a monarch and never been in personal union - even the Norman dukes who took control of England were enemies of the French state, and traced their royal descent to the Anglo-Saxons. And it goes without saying that even in Canada the British and French were enemies. In short, to put England and France together in this fashion, and to make it seem as if they are derived from the same source, is a gross distortion of history. [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] 18:06, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with [[User:TharkunColl|TharkunColl]] on this.  The Canadian monarchy is entirely a descendant of the British one, and has no historical relationship to the French monarchy.

:Okay.  I'll have to check a source at home that, if I recall correctly, talks about an unbroken lineage from the first European colonies, that includes the French kings; but, it ''may'' be talking about the institution of the Crown, as opposed to a bloodline. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 18:39, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You appear to have totally missed the point. As a self-declared monarchist, you don't seem to know much about the ancestry of "your" monarch.

The Canadian monarch on the other hand can do all things listed above. In fact, the Queen of Canada could, if so advised by her Canadian ministers, even declare war on the Queen of the United Kingdom! The fact that the Queen of Canada and the British Queen are physically the same person is irrelevant from a legal point of view as both remain '''two separate sovereigns''' in '''international and domestic law'''.

===Clarify===
Unfortunately, Rufus is never terribly clear about what exactly he sees the problem to be. Generally there is a lot of crowing about monarchist propagandists hiding behind every corner and a conspiracy to bring down the mighty and noble republicans, but, well, none of that assists us in editing an article. I'd like to then take the above explanations of Rufus' edits and break them apart for, hopefully, more clarity.
* '''From time to time the sovereign or another member of the Royal Family will represent Canada abroad.'''
:This sentence has already been altered to read: ''From time to time the sovereign or another member of the Royal Family carry out ceremonial duties on behalf of Canada.'' There is no longer any reference to duties undertaken abroad.
* '''On these occasions they are acting as monarch of Canada and members of the [[Monarchy in Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]]...'''
:[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4918.asp A reference for this] has already been provided, which states "The Queen abides by the decisions of the Canadian Government... In all these duties, The Queen acts as Queen of Canada, quite distinctive from her role in the United Kingdom or any of her other realms." Perhaps the sentence could be rewritten to read: ''On these occasions when the Queen or other member of the Royal Family are abiding by the directions of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Canadian Cabinet]], they are doing so as monarch of Canada[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4918.asp] and members of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]].[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ps/nap/comm/deaw_e.html#hon][http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf]''
* '''...and will regularly carry out two types of duties: official duties involve the sovereign representing the [[state]] at home or abroad, or other members representing the sovereign in Canada or elsewhere. For example, the Queen, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] have participated in Canadian ceremonies for the anniversary of [[D-Day]] in [[France]]."'''
:The [http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/timeline_e.cfm Canadian Heritage reference] provided lists the Queen's participation in Canadian events; the 1994 D-Day anniversary is listed as one of those. Further, there was also [http://www.tvthrong.ca/remembering-vimy/remembering-vimy-90th-anniversary-celebrations-on-ctv-april-9 the rededication of the Vimy Memorial] last year. There is no mention in [http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4204 your cite] of the Governor General being unable to participate in the same ceremony as the monarch. Precedent also proves this assertion wrong.
* '''Presently, the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] is responsible for organizing events wherein members of the Royal Family represent Canada.'''
:This sentence has been altered to read: ''Presently, the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] is responsible for organizing ceremonial events in Canada involving the Royal Family, as part of the State Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Program.''
* '''For example [[Mitchell Sharp]], Canada's External Affairs Minister in the 60s and 70s, recounts in his memoirs a ministerial trip to Latin American he took to promote Canadian products and develop diplomatic goodwill. After the trip was arranged, it was learned that the Queen was going to be there at the same time to promote British goods. He writes: ''"We couldn't ask Her Majesty to perform the function she was performing for Britain on that Latin American trip because the Queen is never recognized as Queen of Canada, except when she is in Canada.'''
:This overly-lengthy and disjointed paragraph has been merged into the preceeding and slimmed down to: ''This situation, however, can mean the monarch and/or members of the Royal Family will be promoting one nation and not another; a situation that has been met with criticism, such as former External Affairs Minister [[Mitchell Sharp]]'s comments on a situation wherein Elizabeth II was in Latin America to promote British goods at the same time a Canadian ministerial trip to the same area was underway to promote Canadian products. Sharp stated: "We couldn't ask Her Majesty to perform the function she was performing for Britain on that Latin American trip because the Queen is never recognized as Queen of Canada, except when she is in Canada."''
* '''However, the Queen subsequently represented Canada abroad on a number of following occasions.'''
:This has already been dealt with above.
* Thus, all-together, the paragraphs in question would read:
:''From time to time the sovereign or another member of the Royal Family carry out ceremonial duties on behalf of Canada; the monarch may also undertake constitutional duties.

-----------

The proposed revisions are a positive step but still fall short of the facts. I'm not going to do a rewrite of everything (yet) - in fact, tonight, I'll comment on just one glaring point: There's still no valid evidence to prove that the Queen 'officially' carries out duties "on behalf of Canada," "represents Canada" or is even permitted to do so when not on Canadian soil. The DDay and Vimy examples only prove that the Queen was there at the invitation of the Canadian Government, taking part in a ceremony beyond her official capacity. The DDay event was even attended by the GG, raising the question: If the Queen were representing Canada or there on Canada's behalf, what was the GG doing there? According to the GG's website: "The Governor General represents Canada on state visits abroad at the request of the Prime Minister." Did we have two heads of state there?

For Vimy; the same applies. It's the GG's job to represent Canada abroad and had she been in France, protocol would have required the French President to also attend. The GG was not there, instead, presiding over a ceremony in Ottawa. Therefore, since no head of state was present on behalf of Canada, the Prime Minister of France represented France and the Prime Minister of Canada represented Canada. The Queen was there as a guest at the request of the Prime Minister. At the time, your own Michael Valpy commented in the Globe that Britain's participation in Vimy (the third nation involved in attempts to take Vimy Ridge, at great cost to life, by the way) was systematically erased from the history books by "Canadian propagandists" (his words), so perhaps inviting the Queen was a way to reconcile that fact.

I'm not being intransigent here. I sincerely would like to get to the bottom of this. In fact, I spent several hours tonight going through my poli-science texts and Googling every possible source to find 'anything' that proves your claim that the Queen represents the state "at home or abroad." I used every imaginable search term. The only thing I came up with was a 1959 BBC archive news item [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/26/newsid_2988000/2988148.stm Queen and Eisenhower open seaway],where the Queen was mentioned "representing Canada" with US President Eisenhower during the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. I found nothing saying that she's done any kind of 'international' duties in this regard.

As well as the above-mentioned description, the GG's website also had this on international duties:"At the request of the prime minister, the Governor General travels to foreign countries building bridges of friendship and understanding." No mention of the Queen.

I found nothing on The Department of Canadian Heritage's website on the Queen's official duties either. Even when the Queen visits Canada, she comes here at the request of the government and her itinerary is rigidly controlled by Canadian Heritage. As far as I can see, there's no list of the Queen's so-called "official duties", even while in Canada.

That means so far, all we have to validly argue any side of the argument are two quotations by two very high profile cabinet ministers: 

* ''"We couldn't ask Her Majesty to perform the function she was performing for Britain on that Latin American trip because the Queen is never recognized as Queen of Canada, except when she is in Canada."'' - External Affairs Minister Mitchell Sharp, That Reminds Me ... A Memoir 1997

And a new one that I can also add if it helps clarify the situation:

* ''"I do believe when most people think about it and realize our head of state is foreign — when she travels she doesn’t represent Canada, she represents Great Britain — I think they kind of realize this is really an institution that’s a bit out of date for Canada to continue with."'' - Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, October 2002

So that's my main problem. Find something that irrefutably states that when the Queen attends an event such as DDay or Vimy that's she's there performing an official duty to represent Canada as our head of state, than I'll drop my objection to it. Otherwise, she's there as a guest by invitation in an unofficial capacity. The only way I'll agree to keeping any reference to the Queen's international activities where Canada is concerned is if you point out that it's done unofficially and that she is not, either by constitution, convention or statute permitted to officially represent Canada or act on Canada's behalf while not on Canadian soil. - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 08:46, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

:* The Queen was directed by the Canadian Cabinet to participate in the 2004 D-Day anniversary in France.[http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4189]
:* At the ceremonies in question - save for the 2004 D-Day anniversary - the Queen was front and centre, not relegated to the side or behind as a foreign or lesser dignitary.
:* At Vimy in 2007 the Queen was attended by Canadian ministers, not British.[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4113.asp?submitted=submit2&quick=latest&fromDay=&fromMonth=&fromYear=&toDay=&toMonth=&toYear=&MRF=Q&keywords=Vimy&submit2=Submit&ID=12283]

* '''"The Queen is the personification of Canada; the human representation of the Canadian state."''' - Sounds like a cult to me. Whatever ... it has no bearing on the discussion of whether the Queen officially represents Canada when attending events abroad. Funny, one of your links even supports my argument: www.royal.gov.uk says: "The Governor-General's role is built on four major themes: representing the Crown in Canada; -->representing Canadians abroad<-- and promoting their sovereignty; celebrating excellence and bringing Canadians together." "At the request of the Canadian Prime Minister, the Governor-General -->travels to foreign countries building bridges of friendship and understanding<--." There's no mention anywhere that the Queen's duties include this role for Canada. 

* '''"The Queen is recognised as the Canadian head of state."''' - Again, unrelated to the discussion. You don't need me to tell you that we have a kind of head of state fairly unique in the world that doesn't have many of the characteristics typical of other countries' executive. One of them is that the Queen's capacity as our head of state begins and ends at our shores. You know, you monarchists are always taking pride in how the international community's definition of head of state doesn't always apply when describing the Queen and her role in Canada. ie: "We have a Sovereign, not head of state," "head of state is a republican invention," and so on. Yet, you have no qualms about using the international formula to back your argument. 

* '''"The Queen always acts, in matters pertaining to Canada, on the advice of her Canadian Cabinet."''' - I agree, and it simply backs up what I've said; that the only real "duty" the Queen has is to reply yes or no when asked to add her presence to events or ceremonies.

* '''"When the Queen acts on the direction of her Canadian Cabinet, she does so as Queen of Canada, not of another country."''' - Canadian Cabinet "direction" only applies to matters regarding the operation of our government. The signing of the Constitution Act 1982, was one. She could not refuse to sign it. Ceremonial matters are an entirely different subject. She is asked and has the option of saying no.

* '''"The Queen was directed by the Canadian Cabinet to participate in the 2004 D-Day anniversary in France."''' - You have proof she was "directed?" In reality (expanding on the previous point), she was "asked." As with all ceremonies in which members of the Royal family take part, there was no obligation. A request is sent to the Private Secretary's Office and a decision is made as to whether the Queen is able to attend. Nothing is carved in stone. Once she leaves Canada, there is nothing in our constitution, laws or conventions obligating the Queen to do anything other than stay alive and/or on the throne until her successor is firmly in place. As Head of the Commonwealth, she also gets similar requests from member states that are republics. Her presence at those functions has the same significance.

* '''"At the ceremonies in question - save for the 2004 D-Day anniversary - the Queen was front and centre, not relegated to the side or behind as a foreign or lesser dignitary."''' - Again, you're straying from the point. I didn't say she was a less important dignitary. I said she wasn't there as an official representative of Canada. And speaking of D-Day, both the UK and Canada took part in the invasion. Which country was the Queen representing when she attended the ceremonies? I can only be one. 

* '''"At Vimy in 2007 the Queen was attended by Canadian ministers, not British."'''  - So what. The Queen travels abroad representing the United Kingdom all the time without government ministers. Besides, I was only speculating on one possible alternative to why she was there. There could be others. I don't see any contradiction in saying that the Queen was invited because of her special relationship with Canada but that officially, she wasn't there on our behalf or as a representative of Canada. 

* '''"None of the events in question was a [[state visit]]."''' - Excuse me. Allow me to revise that to "state visits and officially representing Canada and Canadians abroad."

* '''"Two former republican cabinet ministers hold the personal opinion that the Queen never represents Canada abroad."''' - Yes, two former senior cabinet ministers, one of them a long-time former external affairs minister, the other a former deputy prime minister, who were directly involved in the operation of our government and external affairs ... versus you with a biased monarchist agenda with nothing to support your claims. Hmm, who to believe?

'''"So, it follows that if the Queen is representative of Canada, and was at these events abroad at the direction of her Canadian government, then she was in attendance as Queen of Canada. Though it's neither here nor there at this point, if the Governor General is there it would be as represenative of the Queen - as she always is - and the PM there are representative of the government - as he always is. Really, this isn't rocket science."''' 

Correct, it's not. Yet you still obtusely refuse to get the point: On the state level, the Queen represents Canada solely on Canadian soil and the United Kingdom both at home and internationally. On the other hand, officially, the GG represents the Queen but also Canada and Canadians while abroad. Despite being our head of state, you have no documentation to prove that the Queen has any international "official duties" outside of what she has as the UK's head of state and Head of the Commonwealth. On the contrary, I have. Canadian Heritage, the GG's website and www.monarchy.gov.uk sources all clearly outline the governor general's international role and responsiblities regarding Canada yet fail to mention anything about the
Queen's. - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 20:01, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
:Glad you agree there's no real complexity to this. You're quite wrong, though, in the rest of your assertions. You have no evidence to dispel that which was provided to affirm that the Queen does indeed act as Queen of Canada off of Canadian soil, and therefore represents Canada abroad. Acknowleding this fact does nothing to dispel the Governor General's role in foreign affiars, so we can leave that red herring behind.

::The problem here is that ironically, you're using republican logic to give validity to your case. Everything you've said about the Queen's alleged ability to represent Canada abroad, as far as most republicans are concerned (I would think), are fundamental tenets to what a head of state should be. If she only held that position for one nation or, ideally, if the UK also had their own office comparible to the governor general, then you'd likely have some success in defending your point of view. However, the Queen can't possibly represent Canada abroad one day and the GG do it the next. a) Who gets to decide when that would be and, b) what happens when their paths cross? (as with D-Day) Nor can she represent Canada on one trip and then New Zealand or Barbados on another. It's bad enough that the Queen represents the UK (the Mitchell Sharp observation is one example of how it doesn't work) but to have that responsibility for all 16 nations that have her as head of state leaves too much potential for accidentally promoting or compromising one nation's interests over another's. The solution to the problem is, for the other 15 nations, to just plain not do it - which is exactly what she does quite skillfully. She treads a fine line but, at best, that's all that can be said. Does the fact that you've not put forth a single piece of constitutional evidence to support otherwise not send up a flag?
::Dispute resolution may well be the only way out of this. I'm the only party here that's showing any kind of flexibility. I don't object to an alternative viewpoint on the page. I just prefer that none of the monarchy - republic pages do so while promoting fantasy over facts. So again, I'll repeat: ''"The only way I'll agree to keeping any reference to the Queen's international activities where Canada is concerned is if you point out that it's done unofficially and that she is not, either by constitution, convention or statute permitted to officially represent Canada or act on Canada's behalf while not on Canadian soil."'' - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 23:50, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
:So in other words, the only acceptable article is the one that fits your worldview, even though it has been proven to be false. The Queen herself stating that she represents Canada abroad is a pretty strong statement that the Queen represents Canada abroad. Flags and choice American newspaper headings are not valid refutation of that claim unless they themselves cite where they got their information on the Queen from. If you want to state that the Queen is "not permitted" to do so, especially if by ''statute or constitution'', then you must provide detailed and irrefutable citations detailing that explicitly. One quip by a minister about how most people outside of Canada view the Queen (I'm pretty sure that's what "recognized" means in that quote) is interesting (and should be in the article), but it does not actually make anything law. When the Queen went to Washington in 1957, she went as Queen of Canada. She said she was going as Queen of Canada. The Prime Minister of Canada was her Minister-in-Attendance. The Canadian arms were displayed on lecterns from which she spoke. Her return banquet was given at the Canadian Embassy. How is that somehow not the Queen of Canada?

::Enough of this pointless charade. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 12:52, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

It's sad enough that we have to go back 50 years for an inkling of an argument for your claim so I definitely won't comment on the 1939 visit other than to say that it preceded the Letters Patent 1947 which I've already included as evidence of the GG's assumed role as Canada's official representative abroad. As far as the Queen being the Queen of Canada, I've never said she wasn't. My point is that officially, she doesn't represent Canada or Canadians abroad and, for that matter, has no obligatory official duties outside of her constitutional role in Canada. The suggestion has been made that the 1957 royal visit was proof otherwise. To further my argument to the contrary, I'm going to ignore the arogance, bombast and name-calling and simply paste some quotations from [http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Canada-End-Empire-Buckner-Phillip-Philip-Buckner/9780774809153-item.html?ref=Search+Books%3a+%2527Canada+And+The+End+Of+Empire%2527 Buckner, Phillip Alfred - Canada and the End of Empire, Page 67-69 - UBC Press 2004  ISBN: 0774809159] along with my observations. [http://www.lib.unb.ca/archives/finding/buckner/buckner.html Buckner is a retired University of New Brunswick professor of history]. 

* ''"St. Laurent and Pearson also felt that it was important for the Queen to come to Canada to perform her constitutional functions in person whenever possible, which is why the Liberal government enthusiastically encouraged the Queen to visit Canada en route to the United States in 1957 so that she could open the Canadian Parliament, the first time a monarch had done so in person. (...) However, neither the brief 1957 visit (which was tacked on to the visit to the United States) nor the lengthy 1959 tour had any imperial significance (...)."''

This refutes the statement that the Queen's visit to the US was a Canadian "State Visit." In fact, there was initially no plan at all to have the Queen visit Canada in 1957 because she was already scheduled to visit in 1959 to open the St. Lawrence Seaway. The 1957 '''US''' Royal Tour was planned from the beginning in Britain as a "British" tour marking the 350th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA and also to repair strained relations from the Suez crisis. Visiting Canada was an afterthought which newly elected PM John Diefenbaker exploited to promote his own vision of Canada as a part of a larger British Empire:  

* ''"During the 1957 and 1958 elections Diefenbaker castigated the Liberals for being pro-American and anti-British, and promised to take measures to strengthen the British connection. He saw Queen Elizabeth's visit in 1957 as an opportunity to emphasize the significance of Canada's British heritage, and he eagerly anticipated her return to Canada in 1959."''

Once the Queen was in Canada, Diefenbaker successfully managed to insert Canadian officials and presence into the tour. At the last minute, he even volunteered to become the Queen's senior adviser in order to be part of the scheduled visit with President Eisenhower in Washington. This more detailed passage regarding the 1959 tour reiterates Diefenbaker motivations: 

* ''"During the 1959 tour, Diefenbaker insisted that the Queen be accompanied at all times by a Canadian cabinet minister in case she needed advice on any pressing matter - in other words to maintain the fiction that while the Queen was in Canada she was an active part of the constitution. Diefenbaker was also determined to make it 'quite clear' to the Americans that the Queen was visiting the United States as Queen of Canada and that 'it is the Canadian embassy and not the British Embassy officials who are in charge' of the Queen's itinerary. The Queen's speeches in Chicago, written by her Canadian ministers, stressed steadily the fact that she had come to call as Queen of Canada."''

The point of all this is to prove that the Queen's comments, her speeches and the Canadian presence in the US legs of both the 1957 and 1959 tours were made at the direction of a prime minister (by his own admission) obsessed with promoting a personal anglo-centric view that even then, had no constitutional basis. No prime minister since then has attempted anything remotely similar.

If there's still question as to who the Queen was really "representing" during her tours to the US, this should prove enlightening:

* ''"There was a great deal of unofficial British interest in the 1959 tour, which was extensively covered in the British press, but this was more a reflection of the continuing British fascination with the royal family than with the empire or with Canada in particular. British official interest in the 1959 tour was confined largely to the one-day visit to Chicago, which was included on the tour because a British trade fair was being held there."''

There's no doubt the 1959 tour was heavily staged-managed to promote the Queen as '''"The Queen of Canada,"''' the PM even going so far as to put those very words in the Queen's mouth. Yet on the one day she crosses the border to the US, she immediately assumes the role of Britain's head of state concerned not with promoting Canadian trade, but Britain's. - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 20:17, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

It appears you've got a different interpretation than I do. Let me walk you through it line by line, adding relevancy to my previous points:

1) St. Laurent asks to have a Canadian visit "tacked on" to the US royal tour in 1957 originally planned as a celebration of the anniversary of the Jamestown settlement founding.

2) Diefenbaker campaigns in 1957 on an anti-US, pro-Britain platform and is PM when the Queen visits.

3)  Once the Canadian leg is confirmed, Diefenbaker manages to convince Buckingham Palace to allow Canada to exploit the rest of the tour in the US as a tool to promote his personal view of the monarchy and his campaign promise to "emphasize the significance of Canada's British heritage."

4) The plan falls flat. The Americans don't buy into it. The tour is widely covered as British not Canadian, the royal couple are referred to as British not Canadian and Union Jacks fly instead of Red Ensigns, reinforcing my previous point (and External Affairs Minister Mitchell Sharp's) that the Queen is only viewed as the Queen of Canada while in Canada.

5) The Queen returns to Canada in 1959 for a cross-Canada tour and while here, takes a one-day side trip across the US border to Chicago. Despite Diefenbaker going to great lengths to bill the trip as a visit from the "Queen of Canada", even going so far as to have the Queen's speeches written by Canadian officials, Time Magazine's coverage said Chicagoans waved Union Jacks with no mention of Canada or "Queen of Canada" [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892754,00.html?promoid=googlep]. The Queen even fails to shed her role as British head of state by using the occasion to visit the Chicago International Trade Fair. Here she is in a photo with Prince Philip at the British Automobile Manufacturer's Association's exhibit promoting Triumph cars - just a few hour's drive from Canada's auto manufacturing heartland. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=Byt68YzC5mIC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=1959+%22royal+visit%22+chicago&source=web&ots=_rpoLuRuST&sig=EiBXK2JgOR_zTAq0JfJqdob7B2k&hl=en] This example of the Queen promoting British goods at the expense of Canada - right on our doorstep, no less - parallels Mitchell Sharp's similar experience in Latin America - which again, was previously mentioned.

So no, I'm not affirming that the Queen represented Canada abroad at all. There '''was''' a very pathetic attempt by a prime minister widely known for being insecure, egocentric, hostile, emotionally immature, mentally unstable, neurotic and paranoid [http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1550022075] to do so, but it failed - miserably. The Americans didn't fall for it for a second and the Queen, who made a valiant effort to go along with it at first, failed to resist the temptation to resume her role as British head of state once she detoured off Canadian soil for just a single day.

On the contrary, I feel I've made my case very clear: Everything I've raised reinforces the view that The Queen is Queen of Canada while in Canada or Queen of Australia while in Australia, and so on. Despite the isolated and self-serving efforts of a prime minister generally considered to be Canada's worst, even by many members of his own party (his dramatic exit in 1967 as proof), elsewhere, the Queen is recognized internationally as a British queen and conducts herself as British head of state (even when prompted not to). She may accept invitations to attend ceremonial Canadian events in other countries but there is nothing in our Constitution or statutes that says she's obliged to do so or is officially representing Canada when she does. Instead, in Canada's case, both convention and the Letters Patent 1947 grant the role of representing Canada, its interests and people abroad to the governor general. Again, if you have proof of any legislation that says otherwise, I'd like to hear it.

It would mean that a Commonwealth realm cannot exercise its sovereign rights outside of its own borders (because its head of state has no authority to so act).In turn that must mean that its sovereignty is limited by another power.

I've added my comments to G2's green box above. To sum up, there's no verifiable proof that the Queen officially supercedes the governor general and represents the Canadian state while abroad. What little support there is for the argument is overwhelmingly contradicted by the Letters Patent 1947, the Department of Canadian Heritage's Order of Precedence and the complete absence of any other official guideline, convention, statute or constitutional reference. Aside from this, my argument is also based on jurisdiction: The Queen cannot simultaneously act as the official head of state of all 16 realms due to the possibility of conflicts in the national interests of those states. The Queen's international role is therefore restricted to her duties as UK Head of State, Head of the Commonwealth or ceremonies conducted unofficially as a courtesy to the requesting nation. "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth" or what an editor assumes to be true. All of the arguments for the Queen representing realms internationally are based on preconceived assumptions of what is universally expected of a head of state and then citing ceremonies or events to back up those assumptions. Again, in contrast to domestic protocol, in Canada, there is no official policy on the Queen's status as an international representative of the state. Therefore, in its absence, the documentation that ''is'' available that clearly spells out the GG's role should be taken as official policy. - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 18:10, 4 March 2008 (UTC)
:::Your pivotal argument seems to be that the Sovereign 'cannot simultaneously act as the official head of state of all 16 realms'. As I've explained above, if you follow the logic to its ultimate conclusion, you must say that Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc cannot exercise their sovereign rights outside of their borders (because the head of state cannot). This is evidentally absurd. And in any case, they do. If they couldn't, they could not have sent troops to Iraq. Nor could they send ambassadors to other nations.

I must agree with G2 and Gazzster. The evidence really is incontrovertible. You seem to think the Queen is somehow political. Strictly speaking the Queen can't even be classed as a political person. While many things are carried out "by the Queen" and "in Her Majesties name" she doesn't really act politically at all! It would be a catastrophe is she were political. Just look at her three "most imporant" PM's UK = Labour, CAN = Conservative and AUS = Liberal!!!!--[[User:Camaeron|Camaeron]] ([[User talk:Camaeron|talk]]) 21:31, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

::The examples given in my argument and demonstrated in Mitchell Sharp's observation weren't political in nature. They were related to the promotion of a nation's interests in regards to trade - an area in which the Queen engages herself quite often. I submitted the Queen's visit to Chicago in 1959 as proof that it's impossible for the Queen to divide her loyalties while outside of Britain or the realms. She spends a week touring Canada as our head of state but the one day she crosses the border to the US, she resumes her duties representing Britain and its trade interests at the expense of Canada. To put this particular example in more clear perspective; she visits a trade show and allows herself to be photographed at the British Automobile Manufacturer's Association's Triumph exhibit - an obvious endorsement of their products.[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Byt68YzC5mIC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=1959+%22royal+visit%22+chicago&source=web&ots=_rpoLuRuST&sig=EiBXK2JgOR_zTAq0JfJqdob7B2k&hl=en]  This act would be more than acceptable had the trade show been in the UK, but it's inexcusable during a tour of Canada, a nation that even in 1959, was more reliant on the auto industry than any other for the strength of its econemy. So, forget about political matters. Imagine if the Queen finds herself in the company of the PMs mentioned above and a trade matter has come up. Does the Queen recuse herself? If so, the job cannot be performed effectively by her. Only the Governor General is able to do so. - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 23:30, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

TharkunColl, again I find myself most in line with your reasoning. The Queen should have every right to do what's expected of any responsible head of state, to represent her country, people and culture both at home ''and'' anywhere abroad. The problem arises out of having a head of state shared by more than one country, each with its own interests. The argument amongst some here is that the Queen can effectively do that for the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Barbados, Jamaica, and all the rest of the realms at the same time ''internationally'' without overlap or conflict. My point is that it's patently impossible for the Queen to represent Canada and its trade interests while simultaneously promoting Britain's trade interests. We're not part of the British Empire any more so Britain and Canada now compete economically. As does Britain, Canada trades all over the world. So when the Queen visits our trading partners and promotes British products, she does so at our expense. Therefore, the Queen does not represent Canada or its interests. The best that can be said is that she responds when asked to perform ceremonial duties, something I've already pointed out (with citations) that she does for nations who don't have her as head of state. She also clearly represents the Canadian state when she's in Canada. This is what I've been saying consistently from the beginning of this debate (again, with plenty of references and citations to back it up) and this is the point I want made clear on this page. - [[User:MC Rufus|MC Rufus]] ([[User talk:MC Rufus|talk]]) 02:37, 5 March 2008 (UTC)
:That statement's fine, but you can't apply it to the article as it's complete original research. Has anyone said anything about the Queen travelling simultaneously as multiple monarchs? There are foreign visits that she goes on that have nothing to do with "promoting Britain's trade interests." I sincerely doubt that the Queen was promoting trade when she went to Vimy last year, where, recall, she was accompanied by Canadian ministers, escorted by the RCMP, and was greeted by a Canadian Forces honour guard. She also flew her Canadian standard on the flagpole. How is that the Queen of the United Kingdom promoting "British interests"? There are times (admittedly very few and almost all of a completely ceremonial nature) when the role of the Queen is crystal-clear as being Canadian or whatever other country (though I think Canada is the most common, Australia and New Zealand happened once or twice maybe, and it never happened for any other country). So far your argument against several things consists of a completely contrived need for "constitutional obligation" (which is utter tripe, by the way) and the view of American newspaper editors. You're perfectly right to argue that a great majority of the time, the Queen only travels abroad as Queen of the United Kingdom. However, you have brought merely one vague source from a Canadian minister not speaking officially to advance the view that she ''can't.'' You tried the "not permitted by law" aspect and the and failed to provide a law, as well. You also tried the "not Constitutionally obligated" claptrap and failed to show how that's relevant to the article at all. That, to me, shows that you're more worried about promoting your POV on the monarchy (and how it "isn't Canadian") than you are on making Wikipedia a better place.--[[user:Ibagli|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ibagli rnbs</span>]] ([[user talk:Ibagli|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Talk</span>]]) 06:53, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

I have responded in the table to the "citations," most of which are completely off-topic. Nobody is arguing that the Governor General does not commonly represent the Queen of Canada and Canada in other countries. Nobody is arguing that that does not happen most of the time. Most of those merely state that the Governor General went on a state visit. Whoopdedoo, we know that and nobody doubts it. Somehow you've managed to take the clearly cited and as of yet unrefuted facts of the Queen's actions abroad and twisted them so that you think that we're arguing that the Governor General is irrelevant.--[[user:Ibagli|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Ibagli rnbs</span>]] ([[user talk:Ibagli|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Talk</span>]]) 07:39, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

The list is meant to illustrate the innumerable government references to the GG's international role. Feel free to cite those that do the same for the Queen. I tried and found none, zero, zip, nada. All you've got is Vimy and that does nothing to change the fact that it, like the Diefenbaker fiasco, was an abberation that had no legal basis.

:::There are citations provided above that you chose not to believe.

You agree also, I see, that the Queen has, in the past, performed international functions as Queen of Canada. "Aberration" or not, it has happened and you say so yourself. Citing numerous state visits by the Governor General is still irrelevant in determining the possibility of the Queen doing it too. How can the Queen not be allowed to exercise powers that the Constitution grants solely to her to be delegated as she (through her ministers) sees fit? The Constitution gives vests executive power in the Queen. Foreign trips are an exercise of that power. It's almost nonsensical at this point for you to go on. Whether or not you believe it is right, sane, or good, it '''has happened and it is pedantry to say that the article should ''deny'' it.''' Even the most ardent republicans on here agree.

== Wording ==

While this page remains locked, from the one party that has shown themselves to have an issue with some of the wording here there has been a lot of commentary, speculation, and opinionating, but very little in the way of concrete, and [[WP:V|verifiable]] demands.

So, I was thinking that perhaps before we take this to mediation, those users who've been involved here might collectively come to a conclusion about how to formulate the paragraphs in question.

Presently, the wording it thus:
:''From time to time the sovereign or another member of the Royal Family carry out ceremonial duties on behalf of Canada; the monarch may also undertake constitutional duties. On these occasions they are acting as monarch of Canada and members of the [[Monarchy in Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]],<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4918.asp Buckingham Palace: The Monarchy Today: Canada]</ref> respectively, and will carry out two types of duties: ''Official duties'' involve the sovereign representing the [[state]] at home or abroad, or other members representing the sovereign in Canada or elsewhere. For example, the Queen, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] have participated in Canadian ceremonies for the anniversary of [[D-Day]] in [[France]],<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/timeline_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: Timeline: The Queen]</ref> and the Queen has undertaken duties in the United Kingdom on behalf of Canada.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4113.asp?submitted=submit2&quick=latest&fromDay=1&fromMonth=1&fromYear=1998&toDay=31&toMonth=12&toYear=2007&MRF=Q&keywords=Canada&ID=392 Court Circular; Wednesday, 13th May 1998]</ref><ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4113.asp?submitted=submit2&quick=latest&fromDay=1&fromMonth=1&fromYear=1998&toDay=31&toMonth=12&toYear=2007&MRF=Q&keywords=Canada&page=2&ID=11403 Court Circular; Friday, 14th July 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5179.asp Buckingham Palace: The Monarchy Today: Canada: The Queen's role in Canada]</ref> Presently, the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] is responsible for organizing ceremonial events in Canada involving the Royal Family, as part of the State Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Program.<ref>[http://www.canadapost.ca/personal/collecting/default-e.asp?stamp=stpartl&detail=1350 Canada Post; Canada's Stamp Details: ''Queen Elizabeth: 1926-2006''; Vol. XV No 1; January to March 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/mission/05_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Reinforcement of constitutional links with the institutions of the Canadian Monarchy]</ref> ''Unofficial duties'' are performed by Royal Family members on behalf of Canadian organizations of which they may be [[Patronage|patrons]], through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the [[Canadian Forces]] as [[Colonel-in-Chief]], or marking certain key anniversaries. The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organization. In 2002 members of the Royal Family were present at a total of 117 Canadian engagements, 57 events in 2003, 19 in 2004, and 76 in 2005.''

Along with this, I'd also rename the section "Embodiment of the state" to "Representing the state," and would delete the section "Royal presence" as much of it is now duplicated above, as well as, perhaps, merge in "Symbols."

== Possible Vimy photo copyright infringement ==

G2bambino, you have deleted comments about this issue. Hopefully, this one will last more than a day. So, I will repeat here: The image EIIR-DofE-Vimy.jpg at [[Monarchy_of_Canada#Royal_presence_and_duties]] originated from WireImage.com [http://www.wireimage.com/GalleryListing.asp?nbc1=1&navtyp=CAL====268432&ym=200704] (now owned by Getty Images), a commercial photo website and its usage and copyright are controlled by the original licensing agreement likely granted to the owner of the blog where it was illegally taken. [[Fair_use#Common_misunderstandings|Wikipedia's Fair Use guidelines]] clearly state: "binding agreements such as contracts or license agreements may take precedence over fair use rights."  
May I also point out that I contacted Getty Images to clarify how they administer copyright-protected photos obtained from their websites. These are their comments:
*"None of the images on our site are available for educational use without a license. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Anyone using images from our site must comply with the copyright terms that govern the images. Your email has been forwarded to the appropriate department for investigation."
I would highly recommend that you sort this out with them before you continue to steal photography from them or other sources: Copyright Agent, Getty Images Legal Department, 601 N. 34th Street, Seattle, WA 98103 (206) 925-5000 copyright@gettyimages.com - [[User:McRuf2|McRuf2]] ([[User talk:McRuf2|talk]]) 07:08, 4 April 2008 (UTC)
:I think you better get someone more knowlegable on the subject to weigh in here; frankly, given your motives and your lack of legal expertise I can't just take your word for it. I'm no copyright lawyer either, but by my reading of the fair use guidelines, this image is perfectly acceptable for use in Wikipedia; the word ''may'' in your quote from the guidelines is key. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 13:16, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

::Now that this image has been deleted by Wikipedia, I trust the reason for their decision is clear and that my alleged "motives" and assumed "lack of legal expertise" are no longer an issue. In this regard, I will only say I couldn't care less whether the image stayed or went since it did nothing to further the argument that the Queen was Canada's official representative at the Vimy ceremony. However, I will admit to being committed to making sure you, G2, are held to the same strict standards you have established for my editing. In the future, you may want to follow the advice at [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]] before acquiring copyright images. - [[User:McRuf2|McRuf2]] ([[User talk:McRuf2|talk]]) 14:57, 21 April 2008 (UTC)
:::Actually, the reasons for the decision were not clear; a request to the deleting admin for clarification went unheeded.

== Images ==

[[User:PrinceOfCanada]] has requested that a discussion about the images on this article no longer take place at [[User talk:PrinceOfCanada|his talk page]]; the discussion is thus moving to here. At the last point, PrinceOfCanada was asked to explain why left-aligned images can not go at the end of a section. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 18:11, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

:Stop being dishonest.  I requested that ''you'' no longer post at my talk page.  As for left-aligned images, I never at any point said that they 'cannot' go at the end of a section.  However, you placing them at the end of a section, as I have tried patiently to explain to you on repeated occasions, is a form of formatting that you can only guarantee looks correct on your computer.

::::Both now? Well, we can dismiss "common sense" because what you think is common sense is not what everyone else thinks it is. So, that leaves us with correctness. From your statements one can only deduce that you see some kind of "incorrectness" when left-aligned images are placed at the end of sections. Could you elaborate, please? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 18:56, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
:::::Oh.  Nobody thinks it's common sense to have images in the sections to which they are most relevant?  Wonderful, then I'll move the image of EIIR's wedding on her page down to her Arms section, shall I?  Don't be ridiculous. As to elaboration? No.  I have explained to you a dozen times how formatting works.  That you are functionally incapable of comprehending it is not my concern, though I doubt, based on your history, that you are so much 'incapable' as 'pretending not to'.  Your usual 'debating' style is to wear down your opponent with irrelevancies, ignoring what they say, and needless pedantry until they give in. I have made my point clear on my talk page; I suggest you re-read it. [[User:PrinceOfCanada|Prince of Canada]]<sup>[[User talk:PrinceOfCanada#top| t]] | [[Special:Contributions/PrinceOfCanada|c]]</sup> 19:05, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
::::::I didn't say anything of the sort. But you are mixing up your contexts: are you speaking about page space or html space? You seem to have an issue with left-aligned images being placed at the end of the preceeding section to which they're relevant. As they appear perfectly close enough to the section to which they're related in page space (right, smack in it, in fact), the mystery is: why can't they go at the end of the preceeding section in html? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 19:15, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
::::::::Because you're playing games, and you know it. You have some sort of deep-seated need, apparently, to have left-aligned images. When it is pointed out to you that left-aligned images at the beginning of sections look awkward (due to title placement), you merely move them two lines up, which on most computers will appear the same. Why? Because the image begins rendering where the code is. In this case, at the bottom of the section. With no text after it, the image will 'push' down into the next section, resulting in looking almost precisely the same as having it in the correct section and left-aligned. And again, because of the way formatting works, it makes more sense for the code for images to be contained in the relevant section.  Of course, you know all this, which is precisely why you placed the images there, to score some sort of point. [[User:PrinceOfCanada|Prince of Canada]]<sup>[[User talk:PrinceOfCanada#top| t]] | [[Special:Contributions/PrinceOfCanada|c]]</sup> 19:21, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::If you think that trying to sort something out is playing games, then, sure, whatever you want. But, what we call it is irrelevant. I moved the images because you said they weren't supposed to be there, and that claim was backed up by WP guidelines; and, yes, it altered the header placement; and, yes, the altered header placement was the only change. But, so what? The cheatsheet simply said that an image shouldn't (note the inherent flexibility in the word) be at the top left of a section, not that it can't be at the bottom of the preceeding. In fact, what the Manual of Style says (trumping your user-created cheatsheet) is "Do not place left-aligned images directly below subsection-level... headings, as this can disconnect the heading from the text it precedes." So, what I had done before did violate this, but the moves I made after fit the letter of the manual to a tee. Thus, you haven't a leg to stand on here. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 19:39, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::This is your typical wikilawyering; following the letter while ignoring the spirit. "as this can disconnect the heading from the text it precedes." can also happen when the image is placed at the end of the section, depending on screen resolution, and ''cannot happen'' when right-aligned in the section it actually belongs in for the very simple code reasons I have already explained to you.  Why do you ignore everything that's said to you?

(indent)Basically the issue is this: G2 doesn't understand, despite [[Talk:Order of Canada#Infobox meets line|having said so himself in the past to me]], that different computers will render webpages differently.  Accordingly, editing image placement so that it looks 'correct' on his computer is therefore no guarantee that the display will look good anywhere else.  Which is why I moved images at the beginning of subs to be right-aligned; this ensures the image will display in the relevant section, no matter how else the computer renders the page.  G2's approach is to shuffle images around until they look 'right' on his computer, and too bad for how anyone else sees it. His assertion that he is 'perplexed' is a baldfaced lie, as the issue has been explained to him repeatedly.

:::I checked the recent 'edit history' of this article, to understand the dispute. OK, Prince's edit put Elizabeth Canadian image on the left side of the content, G2's puts it on the right side. Personally, I've no problem with the ''image'' being on the 'right or left side' of the content. Why? because it doesn't disrupt the content. Anyways, that's just my opinon. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 20:06, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
::::You've got them backwards, but close enough. The issue is that G2 refuses to comprehend how formatting works, and refuses to follow what he himself said to me. He keeps ignoring that.

:::::Sorry, there's nothing to say that an image can't be left-aligned, so long as it doesn't immediately follow the subsection-level headings. Following this guideline does not produce any disruption to the article, and it will appear more-or-less the same on yours as it does mine. All we're discussing here is the difference between this:

===GoodDay's suggestion===
I honestly have no problem with either. However, I've a novel idea - I recommend G2's images be applied to Royal Biography articles & PoC's be applied to Royal non-Biography articles (or visa-versa; which you both agree on). [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 20:20, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

::No. It's not about 'my images' or 'his images', it's about ensuring that display is as consistent as is reasonably possible (which my formatting does), it's about ensuring that formatting for one specific computer (which is what G2's formatting does) isn't allowed to override basic considerations of function, it's about ensuring that images render in the sections to which they are related every single time (which my formatting does), it's about not having images render in the right places depending on screen resolution and browser width (which is what G2's formatting does), and finally, it's about making G2 understand that if he is going to inform someone that all computers display differently, ''the same goes for him''.

Would shrinking the Images sizes help? [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 20:45, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
:No, because that still fails to address the basic concern, which is that G2 is not understanding how formatting works.

[[User:PrinceOfCanada|Prince of Canada]]<sup>[[User talk:PrinceOfCanada#top| t]] | [[Special:Contributions/PrinceOfCanada|c]]</sup> 20:51, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
::Cool. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 20:54, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
I have to agree with G2 on the "commonsense" issue. If the image and text render in the way G2 shows in his second example, the relationship between the image and the section below it is clear. As to the rendering issue, is it rendering incorrectly for Prince? Regardless, what does Prince believe it would look like incorrectly rendered? These questions may be answered on either or both of your talk pages, but I will not look to the user talk pages for answers because it is unfair to expect users to look to such discussions after bringing the discussion here. 

Finally, can we stop with the ''ad hominem'' stuff? It makes it very difficult to make sense of this when a third party's reasonable questions are answered with "the problem is so-and-so doesn't unstand (or refuses to understand) X". Frankly, many of us do not understand the HTML coding and rendering at issue here. At the same time, it is unfair to expect us to simply defer to what someone, even someone we trust, says about formatting. Being specific about what problems might result is important for us to understand and resolve the issue. -[[User:Rrius|Rrius]] ([[User talk:Rrius|talk]]) 21:10, 8 September 2008 (UTC)
:''is it rendering incorrectly for Prince?'' That is the key question that Prince will not answer. I can't yet tell if it does or doesn't, or if he merely thinks I've misread the MoS. Very confusing. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 21:15, 8 September 2008 (UTC)


:Saying he doesn't understand isn't an ''ad hominem'', it is simple fact.  He does not understand, or chooses to pretend not to understand, something he himself has said.  He also continues to refuse to address that.

:Moving on. G2's examples above are not illustrative of the problem, which is why I am not bothering to answer the question as they are self-contained boxes (which thus constrains how they render, ensuring that they will show up just about the same everywhere) and not an actual page with content above and below.  To put it really simply, code renders line by line, like so:
::Text
::Text
::Header
::Image
::Text
:etc.

Now, here's G2's version
::Text
::Text
::Image
::Header
::Text

:Given that the image will render before the header, the header can now wrap the image, thus being 'pushed over'.  The same goes for the text.  And depending on the size of the image, the amount of text, etc, this can split the text away from the header--directly prohibited by MOS.  So now the image may or may not, depending on screen size, resolution, and browser width, show up in the section for which it is intended.

:Doing it the first way guarantees that ''no matter what'' your screen size, resolution, or browser width the image will render in the correct section.  It's that simple.

== Images, again ==

[[User:PrinceOfCanada]] is now claiming erroneous formatting of certain images; namely [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=237170205&oldid=237169878 here] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=237170605&oldid=237170334 here].

I ''did not'' place the left-aligned images directly below the second level headings. "The point" of the guideline is not subject to your personal interpretations; it is an instruction, which I have followed to the letter.

I guess you have a penchant for having the headers always clinging to the left-hand margin, or something. But, there isn't a requirement that they do so, is there? I've never seen one, and plenty of articles on Wikipedia don't demonstrate any need; regard the featured articles [[Australian Green Tree Frog]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Nauru]], and [[King Vulture]].

==Mediation Cabal - Outcome==
As many regulars will be aware, the ongoing disputes (on this page and others connected to the Commonwealth Royal Family) surounding image placement have been the subject of a Mediation Cabal request.

I regret that the process has not, to date, resulted in an outcome that both parties feel able to unambiguously endorse.

By any binary pass/fail judgement, we have failed.

However, the journey that we have travelled has not been without achievements.

Both parties to the mediation have worked within a fairly draconian set of rules that I imposed at the start (with one or two exceptions, but we are none of us perfect) to thrash out the issues, and hone down the areas of disagreement considerably. Given that the days prior to the mediation looked more like the start of all-out warfare than any attempt to reach agreement, it has taken a massive leap of faith all round for the parties to get this far, and they are both to be commended for their commitment to the process. 

I would express hope here that they both take on board how much more they were able to achieve through discourse than through battles, and endeavour to continue their future interactions in the same vein, even without having a referee to remind them.

The fact that both have taken steps to remove content from their user space that could be considered as unpleasant towards the other, and have offered apologies to each other is, in my view, evidence that they both wish to contribute constructively to Wikipedia, and that ultimately they will find a way of accomodating each other.
===The remaining issue===
Whilst there are several areas that G2 and PoC continue to have different views on, there remains but a single area where we have not achieved some form of accomodation, the question of left aligned images overlapping into the next section.

It is clear to me that, at the root of the differences here, is the fact that G2 and PoC each use display resolutions that are outside the range of resolutions used by most editors and readers. This has the effect of making it difficult for each to visualise why the other has problems with their prefered layout.

G2 sees images spanning sections as a minor thing, because it merely displaces the next section header to the right a little, but on a lower resolution screen, this displacement may be about a third of the screen.

PoC sees a bit of white space as a minor thing, but on higher resolution screens, it could result in more white space than text.

We have looked at Policies and Guidelines, which are rather vague on who may be right. G2 rightly points out that [[WP:PIC]] depracates introducing white space as a solution to image stack, but PoC equally correctly points out that it does so in a context that implies that if image stack exists, it is something that should be done if there is no other solution available.

I have made suggestions which may well have the effect of making the point moot, by increasing the space used by text without introducing white space. None of this is guaranteed to work, but it may reduce the number of cases where there is an issue.

In the circumstances, I have taken the principles and guidelines that the parties were unable to agree upon, modified them slightly to take account of subsequent discussions, and reproduced them below.

===Principles===
#Left aligned images should not be used ''immediately'' at the start of a section.
#Left and right aligned images directly opposite each other tend to distract the reader and should be avoided (staggered left/right images that overlap are OK).
#Image stacking that overlaps into the following section on any brower (not just the browser used by the editor) is to be avoided at all costs.
#The gallery feature is available where there are many images that should be included.
#White space is unwelcome, and we should avoid it if possible (but not at the expense of allowing an image stack to invade the next section).

===Guidelines===
In these guidelines, the likelihood of an event should be taken by reference to a 1024x768 screen resolution.
#Any decorative images should be culled.
#Where there is scope to do so, text should be expanded to increase the scope to add images.
#Where there is scope to do so, additional paragraph breaks can be inserted to both expand the text size without introducing white space, and bring forward the first opportunity for a left-aligned image. This measure should not involve the introduction of arbitrary paragraph breaks.
#Unless there is a risk that an infobox will encroach in the right column, the first image should be placed at the head of the section, right aligned.
#The next image (or first image if the infobox encroaches) should be placed at the start of the second paragraph in a section, left aligned.
#Subsequent images should be placed alternately left and right (infobox permitting). If an infobox is likely to encroach into a section, we should only add left aligned images every other paragraph until the text will have passed the foot of the infobox.
#Where this is still likely to cause image stacking into the next section, images should be prioritised, and the lower priority images placed in a gallery at the foot of the section.
#Other than cases where the infobox is likely to go right through a section, sections where there is a risk of image stack may be closed with {{tl|clear}} to ensure that even on odd broswers we don't get image stack.
#Where an infobox is likely to go right through a section, and we are using only left-aligned images, we should use {{tl|clearleft}} rather than {{tl|clear}}.
#Wikipedia is a collaborative project, which relies of editors improving each others work. As such, it is always open to editors to attempt to improve the work of others. However, such changes should not have the effect of increasing white space or causing images to span sections.
#Where the two parties are unable to agree on the layout of a particular section, they should both disengage, and invite other editors to decide.
#There may be cases where all parties agree that, in a particular instance, image overlap is not a problem. Where this is the case, [[WP:IAR]] says that we should go with consensus!

===Where now?===
Mediation exists to try and bring two parties to a mutual agreement. It does not seek to (and is not able to) impose a solution.

If the parties wish, they can take this further along the dispute resolution process. I would urge them to consider whether they wish to spend time bogged down in process, or if they would rather get on with improving Wikipedia.

As such, I would suggest;
*Others review the proposed guidelines, and work with the parties to see if there are in fact ways in which we can bring them together.
*Both accept that there is a shortage of guidance on the issue in [[WP:MOS]], and engage at [[WT:MOS]] to seek consensus to expand the guidelines.

At this point, I will be closing the MEDCAB, as I don't believe that we can go further with just the three of us. Thank you to both G2 and PoC for putting up with me as mediator, and I wish you all the very best of luck in reaching an amicable solution here.

If I can help further, please shout up. I will, however be unavailable from Wednesday until October 12th. Sorry, but I'm getting married, and the future Mrs Mayall says "no internet on Honeymoon"

== Images (x3) ==

PoC, you are not adhering what we agreed on at [[Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2008-09-15 Monarchy of Canada]]. Let's review them again:
# Left aligned images should not be used immediately at the start of a section.
# Left and right aligned images directly opposite each other tend to distract the reader and should be avoided (staggered left/right images that overlap are OK) 
# Image stacking that overlaps into the following section on any brower (not just the browser used by the editor) is to be avoided at all costs.
# The gallery feature is available where there are many images that should be included. 
# White space is unwelcome, and we should avoid it if possible (but not at the expense of allowing an image stack to invade the next section). 
# Any decorative images should be culled. 
# Where there is scope to do so, text should be expanded to increase the scope to add images. 
# Where there is scope to do so, additional paragraph breaks can be inserted to both expand the text size without introducing white space, and bring forward the first opportunity for a left-aligned image. 
# <s>Unless there is a risk that an infobox will encroach in the right column, the first image should be placed at the head of the section, right aligned.</s>
# The next image (or first image if the infobox encroaches) should be placed at the start of the second paragraph in a section, left aligned. Subsequent images should be placed alternately left and right (infobox permitting)."

I have, '''per 3''', removed all instances of stacked images, and, '''per 2''', removed any instances of left- and right-aligned images directly opposite each other. This also works '''per 6'''.
* ''[[:Image:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg]]'': As you say the infobox does not touch on this image if it is right-aligned, then, '''per 9''', it can remain right-aligned, and at the stard of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Queen of canada wob.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Ouellet approaches to sign the Constitution.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Canadian Passport Cover.jpg]]'': As this image is the only one in a single paragraph section, it cannot be placed left-aligned, as it should be in the alternating left-right pattern. I thus think that this image should break the old left-right pattern and start a new one afresh, right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:May23 14-QE-Alb.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Ottawa-1939.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Royal Standard of Canada.svg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Francis1-1.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Roy-fam-canada.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Roy-fam-2007.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Rideau Hall04.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section.
* ''[[:Image:Élisabeth II Chef des armées canadiennes.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section (I was incorrect in my earlier placement of this image).
* ''[[:Image:Royal Ontario Museum edit3.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be right-aligned, and, '''per 9''', at the start of the first paragraph of the section. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 17:17, 22 September 2008 (UTC)
:* ''[[:Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg]]'': Per 10, this image should be left-aligned, and, per 1 and 10, at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
::No, '''per 9''' it should be at the beginning of the section, right-aligned, as no infobox can encroach.  I'm on 1024x768 resolution, which is what layout should be optomized for.
:* ''[[:Image:Ottawa-1939.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.
::As above, but since there is absolutely no chance of it spanning into the next section, I'm willing to leave it.

:::Images spanning into following sections is not of import at this moment; that is a matter yet to be decided on. What seems to be the problem here is the interpretation of "first image"; I read it as the first image in the article, whereas it seems you are reading it as the first image in any given section. Your take, however, doesn't work with the left-right alternation pattern of 10, and, in fact, will cause image stacking rather than eliminating it as per 3. It would also mean that you should object to the placement of more than just the three images you drew out above; as each section only has one image, your version of things would see every image right-aligned. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 18:33, 22 September 2008 (UTC)
::::"Unless there is a risk that an infobox will encroach in the right column, the first image should be placed at the head of the section, right aligned." seems pretty unambiguous; 'of the section' implies that the only thing being discussed is sections, not the entire article.

:That is a direction made by WP:ACCESS. However, it does not say that the first image in a section cannot be left-aligned as long as it comes at least at the start of the second paragraph. I might venture to say that you are reading the WP:ACCESS example too literally; if one were to follow it as you say should be done, all sections of Wikipedia could only have one image, which must be right-aligned, and placed between the header and the textual body of the section. As WP:MOS guides us on how to place left-aligned images as the first image in a section, this interpretation, however, cannot be the case. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 19:04, 22 September 2008 (UTC)
::It does, however, very clearly show that the ''first'' image in a section should be at the beginning of the section.  Which [[User:Mayalld|Mayalld]] also said.

:::No, this will not simply be dropped. The WP:ACCESS example does not say that the first image in a section cannot be a left-aligned one as long as it comes at least at the start of the second paragraph; it merely illustrates how an image that comes at the head of a section should be placed. Further, both WP:MOS and WP:ACCESS say: ''"Do not place left-aligned images directly below subsection-level (=== or greater) headings, as this can disconnect the heading from the text it precedes."'' WP:ACCESS says to move the image "''to another relevant location''," which WP:MOS outlines as "''shifting left-aligned images down a paragraph or two''." That means that left-aligned images can be the first to follow the header, as long as they are placed as guided. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 19:28, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

:::::Actually, looking at the MedCab page: no, I did not agree to that. I said: "Unclear: does 'first image' mean the first in the article, or first in any section?" That question was never answered.

::::::It is abundantly clear what that particular statement means.

It is obvious from reading the list that [[User:Mayalld|Mayalld]] posted above (as opposed to your reordering) that there is a progression from point 1 to 2, and so on to the final point, listed from simplest and most desirable option all the way to how to resolve an impasse should the preceding steps not work.

Because there is such a fine, but important, difference between ''the'' and ''a'' is why I said the statement was unclear.

:When I drafted up the guidelines, I was thinking in terms of sections, rather than the article as a whole, and envisaged right aligned images starting each section. 
:As things stand, with a lack of agreement on image spanning, it may actually make more sense, in some cases, to start with a left aligned image, but only where starting a section with a right aligned image is in some way problematic (that is a subjective thing, and in the eye of the beholder).
:G2, please remember that these are suggested guidelines, not bulletproof rules that we can analyse to an extraordinary degree.

::Hi.  Left-aligned images at start of sections are deprecated by MOS.  Can you just, to settle the dispute, clarify explicitly that when you said "Unless there is a risk that an infobox will encroach in the right column, the first image should be placed at the head of the section, right aligned," you intended it to read as "Unless there is a risk that an infobox will encroach in the right column, the first image in a section should be placed at the head of the section, right aligned."?

:::::Well, with that cleared up (thank you Mayalld), my disagreement with that particular suggestion is cemented. Left-aligned images being the first in a section (as long as their placement adheres to the clear guidelines of MoS) is not deprecated by WP:MOS. Nor is it made so by WP:ACCESS. Prince, we have made some agreements (no extraneous images, no images directly across from each other, no image stacking, etc.), but you have explicitly stated that you are opposed to ''all'' left-aligned images, as well as to images and infoboxes spanning section divisions. I maintain that these are opinions unique to you, and, as such, to have them "enforced" (so to speak) as editing guidelines necessitates a consensus. Do you disagree with that? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 15:37, 23 September 2008 (UTC)
::::::I do indeed disagree with what you have said.  The thing is, G2, if you're going to allude to things I've said, I would request that you do so ''accurately''.  Yes, I am opposed to all left-aligned images, however as I have stated, I realize that will never happen.  Further, I am opposed to all ''left''-aligned images spanning sections due to formatting issues with subsequent sections, and I am only opposed to ''right''-aligned images doing so when it causes issues with formatting in the next section(s). Do stop misrepresenting what I say, will you?  Clearly this needs to go to MedCab ''again''.

:::::::Asking for your confirmation was me trying to achieve accuracy; thank you for helping. The other thing I was looking for your agreement (or disagreement) on was whether or not you think you should seek a consensus in order to make a new guideline that stipulates neither images nor infoboxes shall span a section line (there can be no exceptions for right-aligned images, surely, as "causes issues with formatting" is too vague and dependent on the differences between personal opinions). --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 18:31, 23 September 2008 (UTC)
::::::::Why is it that you insist, over and over and over and over, on me repeating things that I have already explained to you at great length?  As I have already explained, repeatedly, I am only concerned with ''right''-aligned images spanning into following sections when they interfere with the correct formatting of images in those sections.  Therefore, of course there are exceptions; namely, when there aren't any images in the following section(s). Given that at no point did I say that "neither images nor infoboxes shall span a section line," I would ask you, for the last time, to stop misrepresenting my words.  I suggest that you look up the definition of 'strawman' as a logical fallacy for why I object to it.

::::::::[[User:Mayalld|Mayalld]] based every single one of his recommendations on MOS and common sense.  ''Every single one''.  He showed specific citations supporting why he made his decisions, which I happen to agree with.  I suggest that you re-read them, and stop bothering me with these repetitive questions.  I have made my position crystal clear; I (and [[User:Jao|Jao]] and [[User:Mayalld|Mayalld]]) have shown you the relevant portions of MOS and other policies (such as [[WP:ACCESS]]) that support what we are saying.  Notice also that [[User:DoubleBlue|DoubleBlue]], who is obviously active when it comes to image cleanup, also agreed with what I was doing.

::::::::Moving on to "well it doesn't say no!": It would be fundamentally impossible for WP policies to outline ''every single situation or action'' that you may not take, not to mention beyond ridiculous.  Instead, most WP policies--especially those regarding style and layout--offer up the preferred/best solution without digressing into potentially infinite permutations of what is ''not'' permissible.

::::::::To reduce things to their absolute bases: you are trying to force formatting so it looks perfect on your screen, which is a resolution used by less than 16% of internet users.  I am attempting to ensure that formatting is ''generally'' the same across all computers, with optimization aimed at 1024*768 resolution, as provided by the relevant sections of the MOS.  Or do you deny that MOS says that display should be optimized for 1024*768?

:''[De-indent]'' I am trying to reduce the argument to its essence, which now leaves us with but two key points: 1) whether or not the first image in a section must be right-aligned; and 2) whether or not any image or infobox may span a section divider. These points remain because the MoS is not clear on these matters; in fact, Mayalld explicitly says so [[#The remaining issue|above]]. However, unless it can be proved otherwise, you are alone in your objections to the way this article was, and alone with your claims about making things right on every computer, and how to do so. This article (and others) sat ''completely'' undisturbed in regards to left- and right-alignment of images and images crossing section headers until you raised your objections. In other words, this remains a matter of your personal opinion. This is not to say that your objections are invalid, and we (you, me, and Mayalld) have worked to accommodate some of them. But, we're now into the realms of policy and guidelines, meaning decisions here will set a precedent that will carry on to other articles indefinitely. Mayalld suggested this go to [[WT:MOS]] to find a consensus, and I agree with him on that point. The question is: do you? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 19:13, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

::1)As I have explained repeatedly, yes it should, per the policies I have already linked to. 2) At what point did I say it can't?  I said only that ''left''-aligned images should not due to formatting concerns in subsequent sections, ditto for ''right''-aligned images when subsequent sections contain images, and therefore can cause image stack, which is absolutely and explicitly deprecated.  As for 'personal opinion', so is your opinion against whitespace, so ''stop'' devaluing my position.  I have never raised any objection about going to [[WT:MOS]].  By all means go post there; I am busy at a conference for much of the remainder of the afternoon and probably into the evening.  The correct way to take this to [[WT:MOS]] is to post, verbatim and without any refactoring or comment, [[User:Mayalld|Mayalld's]] principles 1-5 and guidelines 1-9 (10-12 are standard WP practice and need no further comment), and ask for comment on them.  That means there will be a ''neutral'' post, created by a ''neutral'' party.  Yes or no?

:''[De-indent]'' No, it can't. This whole exercise has been an attempt to find some common ground between you and I in terms of image layout; this has all been exactly as [[WP:CON]] and [[WP:BRD]] guides us to do. Changes were made to the article in attempts to reach a satisfactory end, and they've sat while things were being discussed because edit warring is discouraged. But, it seems we've hit an impasse on the two points I highlighted earlier. Now, per WP:BRD, the ''original consensus remains until a new one is formed''. I offered to restore the still standing consensus on images with alterations that conformed to what we agreed on at MedCab, but you responded by saying that you would not leave such a reversion alone. You now seem to be saying you won't leave any restoration of the consensus alone.

:::Your discussion at [[WT:MOS]] is obviously your attempt to achieve a new consensus on image placement at this article (which, if successful, would become a precedent for future guidance). What's in the article now has sat because we were using the article as a testing ground for our individual interpretations of the MedCab outcome and (I, at least) then left it as I didn't want there to be any perception of an edit war or a 3RR breach. I still contest the edits you've made. Thus, there is no reason at all for the article to remain as it is now: the guidelines are clear on what should remain, and it is not the disputed changes. You know full well that we did agree on more of the MedCab recommendations than those we disagreed on, and I suspected you'd have faith in my ability to know which of those was which. You, however, said you would not let those changes alone. I can restore the original layout and then carefully make changes, being absolutely clear on what recommendations we agreed on, and how the change adheres to that.

::No, '''per 9''' it should be at the beginning of the section, right-aligned, as no infobox can encroach.  I'm on 1024x768 resolution, which is what layout should be optomized for.
:* ''[[:Image:Ottawa-1939.jpg]]'': '''Per 10''', this image should be left-aligned, and, '''per 1 and 10''', at the start of the second paragraph of the section.

== Bibliography/References/Footnotes ==

A couple issues with this section:
*Many refs are duplicated between the Biblio & Refs.  This seems redundant to me; I suggest we remove duplicates from the Biblio
*Many of the footnotes in the Refs section aren't references, as such; I propose we move them to a 'notes' section.  Relatively simple to define ref groups, and anything in the footnotes which needs to be cited (I see a couple) can have their own cites to the refs section.

== Step 1 - clean the slate ==

After giving this some thought, it seems prudent to take each step towards a solution to this matter slowly, to spell everything out clearly, and to have agreement on one before moving to the next.

Step one would be restoring the last standing consensus; cleaning the slate, so to speak, and starting again. The last consensus was that which was [[Wikipedia:Silence and consensus|established by silence]], and stood until September 8. This will:
* make the article neutral in terms of image placement; it does not restore a version preferred by either party involved,
* allow us to then move to the next step of clarifying what guidelines for image placement are agreed on by both parties involved.
There should be agreement on this move before it is made.

* '''Support''': it will undo the contentious edits and provide a level playing field. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 14:15, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
* '''Support''': restore to September 8th version. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 14:51, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
* '''Strongly Oppose''': And ''again'', '''you''' made the edit to a version while the conflict was ongoing. Neither I nor anybody else objected to that, which made that the new consensus.  '''You''' also violated BRD, which you were claiming as your justification.  See point 2 at BRD, especially "Do not revert this!"; it might provide some clarity.  Oh, and by the way? The only reason you were unblocked is directly because of me.  A thank you would be nice.

I have followed this dispute from a distance for a few days and am bewildered by it. Why is the placement of images so contentious on this article when it is rarely, if ever, a problem on the other two million articles on Wikipedia? [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] ([[User talk:Newyorkbrad|talk]]) 19:11, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
:Indeed, the article rested undisturbed in terms of images essentially since its creation. Why they've suddenly become a focus is a mystery to me too, but, alas, they have and it has to be dealt with. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 22:04, 26 September 2008 (UTC)
Short version: because G2bambino is attempting to force formatting so it works perfectly on his computer, which is explicitly forbidden by MOS.  Indeed, MOS stipulates that formatting should be optimized for 1024*768 display, which he doesn't use.  Add in a bunch of him not understanding how formatting actually ''works'', and his general tendency to refuse to back down when wrong (note the severe wikilawyering above over 'the' versus 'a'), and it all becomes a bit clearer.

Where this dispute emerges is from a collision of those MOS deficiencies with your adamant belief that your interpretations of the vagueries and filler for the gaps is absolutely correct, beliefs that, ironically or not, support your preferred layout and unique objections. You now won't even allow an easy restoration of the consensus (even going so far as to dispute what that consensus was) so that we can try and get each image placed, one by one, in a manner acceptable to all.

:::::::::I won't allow restoration of what you falsely call 'consensus' because 1) that 'consensus' clearly and uncontrovertibly breaks MOS rules; 2) because a newer consensus emerged the moment that you edited the page 'while the conflict is ongoing' and ''nobody objected to it''; 3) because you are ignoring [[WP:BRD]], especially point #2. You decided to quote [[WP:BRD]] to support your position, therefore you have to live with the fact that ''you are wrong'' per the precise policy you quoted. I ''have been'' cooperative: 
:::::::::*I attempted to discuss this with you when the initial issue--image bunching--arose.  You were belittling, dismissive, and kept ignoring extremely plain-English explanations of what I was doing
:::::::::*I engaged in the MedCab case that you started, was cooperative throughout.  That is, until you decided that the case was a failure because you didn't get the answer you wanted.  You really have never addressed why you would ask for a neutral third party to intervene, and then refuse to abide by their suggestions.  The only conceivable answer is that you wanted a specific response, and you didn't get it.
:::::::::*I have further tried to be cooperative here, but it is frankly impossible to do so with you.  Your incessant wikilawyering (again, your utterly ridiculous bit about 'the' versus 'a', when you were completely and utterly wrong, as proven by [[User:Mayalld|Mayalld's]] clarification) and gaming makes it impossible to actually engage in any discussion with you.  I'm not the only one who has noticed this.  I would suggest you revisit [[Talk:Autumn Phillips]], [[Talk:Monarchy of Australia]], [[Talk:Republicanism in Australia]], [[Talk:Commonwealth realm]] for just a few of your more recent examples of gaming, wikilawyering, condescension, patronizing attitude, and in the case of [[Talk:Autumn Phillips]] further refusal to accept what completely neutral and uninvolved ''experts'' have to say.  Again, one has to wonder why, when ''experts that you yourself asked for comment'' are ignored by you, what the point of trying to engage you in discussion is?  You claim that I am not being cooperative?  You claim that I am not open to being wrong or "not automatically right"?  You won't even listen to ''experts''. 
:::::::::The fundamental issue is that you refuse to accept that other people can possibly be right.  You refuse to accept when people explain, patiently, why you are wrong.  Instead, you game, you wikilawyer, you ignore what they say, you misrepresent what they say, and you outright lie about what they have said.  'Cooperation' doesn't mean 'doing what G2bambino says.'  I ''have'' cooperated.  I ''have'' tried to deal with this dispute in good faith.  You haven't.  You have continually belittled me, insulted me, ignored what I had to say, and ignored what uninvolved and disinterested third parties have had to say. The only possible conclusion to be drawn from that is that you will only accept one answer--your way or the highway, and damn the ''experts'' who say otherwise.  I would further add that you yourself characterized this whole issue as 'lame'.  If it's so lame, why are you pursuing it? Oh right, you claim there are 'other issues'.  These 'other issues' are on your side; they boil down to you being upset at your eventual realization that I was absolutely correct in my explanations of what {{tl|fixbunching}} did and absolutely correct in using it, and you expended a lot of hot air in belittling me--and insulting me, what with your accusations of 'vandalism' and a 'screw you attitude'--before you finally understood how it actually worked. ETA: I notice that you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Monarchy_of_Canada&curid=12197038&diff=241230681&oldid=241230469removed your statement] "Step by step you've been nothing but an obstruction." Could that possibly be because you realize that it's a) a complete fabrication, and b) entirely applicable to you?

:::::::::I would also note that there have been absolutely ''no disputes'' about any other image moves I have made in any other articles. Not one. And given that on WP silence=consent, one has to realize that this is really much more about ''your'' personal peccadilloes, ''your'' sense of [[WP:OWN|ownership]], and ''your'' inability to comprehend that anyone can have a different opinion on anything and be equally or more right about it than you do. 

:::::::::And finally, I would further note that the only reason you are unblocked is because I am.  Now, a large part of why I requested to be unblocked was based on the presumption that your threat to resign from the project was actually true.  Seeing as it's not, I would have absolutely no difficulty in asking that we both be reblocked.  Perhaps it would give you time to meditate on your projection. I should point out, by the way, that if with your long history of blocks and warnings you don't yet understand what [[WP:EW]] is, you never will.

''[De-indent]'' You've already tried this argument. There is no new consensus, the absence of which is explicitly proven by the fact that there is still an ongoing debate on the matter. This also means that leaving it as is will not end the problem; a) the article still looks terrible, and b) you'll take your unique quirks and interpretations to other articles. Trying to bully me into silence similarly will not be successful. The article will be changed, one way or the other. I felt it would be a good idea to start afresh and go through each image one by one. You, however, have made it clear that you will stand in the way of that attempt. Thus, edits will have to be made to the page from its current incarnation, within the established guidelines, of course.

''[De-indent]'' No headers should wrap around left-aligned images is not a guideline. The claim that the first image in a section must be right-aligned is under dispute at [[WT:MOS]]. These matters affect the layout of the page. You need consensus on both matters before imposing them here. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 06:09, 27 September 2008 (UTC)
:Actually, left-aligned images splitting text away from headers is precisely why left-aligned images are specifically deprecated under a section header. The same issue can occur with left-aligned images spanning into the next section, as well as it being--as I have already explained, at great length--more difficult to read. But what we are discussing here is the layout of ''this'' page. So what, ''precisely'', do you object to about the image layout as it currently stands? That means: what, ''precisely'' about the image layout as it is now is contravening MOS? Anything? [[User:PrinceOfCanada|Prince of Canada]]<sup>[[User talk:PrinceOfCanada#top| t]] | [[Special:Contributions/PrinceOfCanada|c]]</sup> 06:18, 27 September 2008 (UTC)
::Yes, but nobody is, as far as I know, proposing to have left-aligned images anywhere but one paragraph under a section header. I suppose there is the very odd chance that an image that's placed thusly could be ''just'' big enough, in a section that's ''just'' short enough, on a screen that's ''just'' the right size and ''just'' the right resolution, to have it's bottom edge land right where the next section's header is, shearing it over leftwards from the following text. But, what are the chances of that? And there's no guideline regarding where the bottom of an image should plop; only where its code (in html) and thus its top (in paper space) should be. So, though it might occasionally result in some unattractive layout, it isn't against any rules. Could it be avoided by saying: no left-aligned images in short sections (say, three paragraphs or less)?

What part of "please discuss changes at talk page per [[WP:BRD]]" is unclear, G2bambino? [[User:PrinceOfCanada|Prince of Canada]]<sup>[[User talk:PrinceOfCanada#top| t]] | [[Special:Contributions/PrinceOfCanada|c]]</sup> 04:19, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

Just to be perfectly clear, [[WP:BRD]] states that the process is:
# [[WP:BOLD|Boldly make the desired change]] to the page. 
# Wait until someone [[Help:Revert|reverts]] your change or makes another substantial edit. '''[[WP:ROWN|DO NOT revert this change]]'''!
# If a disagreement arises, gracefully back down a bit, and [[Wikipedia:talk pages|explain and discuss]] your reasoning with the reverter and consider their different views too (don't go for discussion with too many people at once).  Once you reach agreement, start the cycle again by making the agreed change. 

So..

#You made a bunch of changes
#I reverted them
#You reverted that... huh?  That's not how the process works.

Please discuss your proposed changes here. [[User:PrinceOfCanada|Prince of Canada]]<sup>[[User talk:PrinceOfCanada#top| t]] | [[Special:Contributions/PrinceOfCanada|c]]</sup> 04:22, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

== Personal union - quote out of context ==

The following footnote appears in the article:
Micklem, Micklem (1930). The Australian Quarterly. Australian Institute of Political Science, 36-38. "...there are now half a dozen States who have a common sovereign - a large scale personal union..."

I thought it was a curious thing, so I borrowed the book and found it was out of context.

The author is not Micklem but K. H. Bailey, Professor of Jurisprudence, in the university of Melbourne. He writes:

:"What light to the propsals of the experts throw upon the interpretation of the report of 1926? Clearly they suggest that rapid steps should be taken to give effect to the definition of Dominion status in its literal - and widest - sense. Now there have been eminent critics, both British and foreign, who have not hesitated to say that, '''on this interpretation''', the true analysis of the British Commonwealth is that there are now half a dozen States who have a common sovereign - a large-scale personal union. To speak in terms of a personal union is perhaps to use '''out-worn terminology''', and to miss the significance of a development [[sui generis]] in constitutional law. Possibly the real contrast cannot be described more precisely than as one between a body of communities whose relations are "unitary" and a body whose relations are, in a phrase of Sir Harrison Moore's, "given over to severalness." Be that as it may, the contention of the critics above-mentioned is vigorously and cogently denied."

The 1926 report is that of the Imperial Conference of that year. I hope this provides further reflection on the necessarily to check quotes for context in certain circumstances. --[[User:Lawe|Lawe]] ([[User talk:Lawe|talk]]) 03:08, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

::::It's already been provided '''and responded to by you'''. Your refusal to accept that is really, really not my problem, but I will try, one last time: yes, the source alludes to the fact that other people have used the term. This is not in dispute. However, the implication--especially considering the very selective quote you used, which has now been fixed by me--is that the source ''agrees'' with the term. This is misrepresentation of the source. If you want a reference that uses the term, use a reference that does not explicitly say that it feels the term is incorrect. You are, again, ignoring the ''actual meaning'' of what the source says in favour of strict textual copying. 
::::By analogy: 
::::Roger Ebert writes a movie review that includes the statement "Some critics have said this is a good movie. They are very wrong." -- this would be a good source for a WP statement such as "There is disagreement on the merits of this movie."
::::You are using that reference thus: "...critics have said this is a good movie."
::::While it is ''very technically'' correct inasmuch as those words do actually appear in the source, using the reference in that way is a clear misrepresentation of what the source actually means. Most people will see an article that says "critics have said this is a good movie"<sup>[1]</sup> and (rightly) think that the reference is to a critic saying it is a good movie. They will ''not'' think "Hey, that must be a reference to someone who is only quoting another critic and then completely disagreeing." The superior method is to actually use the actual sources which actually use the term, which in this analogy would mean using the writings of the critics who said it was a good movie.
::::So. In this situation, using Bailey as a source for 'personal union' suggests to the reader that ''Bailey'' has used the term, not that Bailey is referring to others using the term, is therefore misleading and pushing a POV against that of the source, and is ''wrong''.

:::::::Twisting your words? I'm sorry, I'm unaware of having done so. You admit the source supports the fact that other people have used the term. Using the source to support a claim in the article that the term has been used, then, is implying the source supports the use of the term how, exactly? In other words, you seem to be objecting to an argument being made in the article in favour of the term "personal union" - your analogy being: "Some critics have said this is a good movie. They are very wrong," being used to say "...critics have said this is a good movie." But, the only way that would parallel what's in the article would be if the article said "personal union has been used to describe the relationship," and nothing further. However, the article ''does'' go on to say that the term "personal union" is not wholly accepted as the right one to use in the context of the Commownealth realms, and actually uses the ''same'' source to support the existence of objection. Nothing is, therefore, being taken out of context. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 20:47, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

He is not being presumptuous. The point roux and I make is perfectly clear. Roux has acknowledged your explanation. The responses are repetitious and most superficial. This has simply wasted time.

:Your point is clear, but unfounded. Roux, further, never substantiated his claim that I was pushing a POV. His attempts to do so were struck down by contravening facts. In the face of those, he simply gave up. I don't know whether or not he thought it was my wish to dismiss and delete the wider part of the source you provided (which wasn't earlier ignored by me, I simply couldn't see it), he won't really say, but it wasn't. The point remains that I believe the source supports ''two'' statements in the article: 1) people used the term "personal union" to describe the relationship between the Commonwealth realms, and 2) other people disagreed with that interpretation. How that promotes a POV, I have no idea. --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] ([[User talk:G2bambino|talk]]) 15:08, 29 October 2008 (UTC)
::I have explained precisely why it is pushing a POV: because there is a direct implication--of which you were fully aware when you so carefully selectively quoted the source--of meaning which the source quite simply doesn't support. There were no 'contravening facts', and I haven't 'given up' because of these invisible things--I had left the discussion because you are doing what so many people have pointed out that you do in every discussion: you stall, you endlessly nitpick, you bog down in minutiae of semantics, you [[WP:IDHT|IDHT]] at every turn, you continually repeat the same thing forcing people to repeat and repeat and repeat what they have already said; in short, you [[WP:GAME|game the system]] until people get so fed up with arguing in circles that we just give up because arguing with you is a Sisyphean task. It's slow, it's painful, and right when you think it's over--BAM! the rock comes crashing back down the hill. Rather than actually comprehending why I left the discussion yesterday--namely, your behaviour--you instead put a spin on it that leaves you as the only person who is actually contributing to a discussion while insulting me as someone who runs away with his tail between his legs as soon as (supposed) facts are (supposedly) presented. You do this all the time, everywhere; what you say is fact, what other people say are 'claims', for example. I could go into probably a hundred more examples of how you do this, but I have better things to do with my time.
::The bottom line is this: we all know you have a POV about the words 'personal union'. We've all seen the ridiculous lengths you went to at [[Talk:Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realm]] to try and avoid the fact that there are virtually ''no'' sources which support the use of the term to describe the Commonwealth monarchies while there are many, many sources which categorically and explicitly state that the term is simply not accurate and/or is woefully out of date. We've all seen your selective quoting of sources, your subtle misrepresentations of sources, your [[WP:OR|OR]] and [[WP:SYN|SYN]] (most especially on the Zines quote) to not only push your POV, but to claim that your sources have said something which they absolutely and categorically have not. These are all things you are widely known for, and indeed are contained in a convenient summary--endorsed by people uninvolved in ''any'' conflict with you--at your RfC/U.
::The thing about your POV is that it is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, ''wrong''. The only sources which appear to support your contention are seventy years old, and few and far between. The sources which directly and flatly contradict your contention range from at least 1930 right up to the past couple of years--and that's even if we only use the sources which you deem 'relevant'! You can keep trying to push it if you like, but both Lawe and myself (mostly Lawe; I've been busy doing other things) are working on erasing this POV from Wikipedia in favour of facts. You can try to reinsert it, you can try to sneak it in by implication (as you did with the quote at hand), you can try whatever you want... but it won't work. You are pushing a POV that is unsupported, proven by the fact that you have to selectively quote your sources and engage in [[WP:OR|OR]] and [[WP:SYN|SYN]] (Zines, Corbett, to name two) to even get them to agree with you, or grasp at offhand comments in a court case from 1999 that is itself quoting a court case from somewhere around 1930--while claiming that the source clearly and unambiguously supports the use of the term.
::You are clearly intelligent. Claiming that you 'don't see' how there's any implication derived from using a reference to support the use of a term (in a strictly textual sense) when that source clearly and explicitly argues against the use of that term falls somewhere on the spectrum between 'disingenuous' and 'dishonest'. I'm trying to A as much GF as I can, here, but you make it impossible.
::In short, please get over it. You're wrong, your POV is wrong, your continued attempts to push it will be met with complete opposition in complete accordance with [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. I left the discussion because of your ''behaviour''. Which is why I said I left the discussion because of your behaviour. I really urge you to try actually reading what people write, rather than putting--to use your words--a self-beneficial spin on it, a spin that ''somehow'' always leaves you looking like either the champion of facts and rational discourse, or the poor victim of crusaders out to discredit your good name, and ''somehow'' always leaves your opponents as sad little people who run away at the first glimpse of facts.

:::More claims of POV pushing on my part with no support behind them other than personal opinions, and all in denial of what has already been said: I didn't selectively quote the source; I never made any attempt to deny the existence of presented sources; I was not the one who originally found and added the Zines source; I never tried to make the source say what it didn't; etc., etc. You may believe these things to be true, and you may believe your version of the truth is "widely accepted", but I can say without doubt that you are much more off than on in your take on what the truth is; not that I have much faith in your even considering that statement. That your perceived truth about me is mostly wrong is disappointing, but that you believe your truth to be absolutely unshakable is disturbing. I'm not going to pursue the issue of where the source applies as there's already another source that suffices. However, it is your penchant for using every discussion between you and I as a platform to launch unfounded personal accusations and make disparaging insinuations against me that I cannot tolerate, and which will have to come to an end one way or the other.

== roots in the French and British crowns ==

*''The Canadian monarchy has its roots in the French and British crowns, from which it has evolved over numerous centuries to become a distinctly Canadian institution[15] – one of the few crowns that have survived through uninterrupted inheritance''
This part seems revisionist, and a monarchist POV. What roots does the monarchy have in the French crown? Didn't it evolve strictly from the British crown since the transfer of New France to the British empire? I don't think the inheritance of the last king of France to have ruled in a territory which is now part of modern Canada was given to the first British monarch in the 18th century, which means that it has not be uninterrupted. --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 20:31, 28 February 2010 (UTC)
:Do you see monarchist POV everywhere? Here, from [http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/crnCdn/crn_mpls-eng.pdf a government published source]: "Initially established under the rule of the kings of France during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Canada's monarchical institutions continued as a key element of government under the British Crown as a colony, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." "The Crown in Canada was first established by the kings of France in the sixteenth century... The colonies that united and formed the Dominion of Canada in 1867 had already enjoyed a long and uninterrupted association with the Crown." I suppose this too was written by plotting monarchists who infiltrated the Department of Canadian Heritage? --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 00:07, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

::Just because France was also a monarchy in the 18th century doesn't mean that the Canadian monarchy has roots in it. You can say that Canada (the territory, because the country didn't exist at the time) switched from one crown to an other (or from one monarchy to an other), but it wasn't an "uninterrupted inheritance" for sure. Oh and by the way, absolutely nothing from the Department of Heritage says that the Canadian monarchy has '''roots''' in the French monarchy. It just call the French monarchy Canadian and then the British monarchy Canadian as well. It doesn't mean that there hasn't been a regime change in between. The "long uninterrupted association with the Crown" probably refers to  about 1760 to 1867, the colonial British rule, during which there have been no interruption in the crown. --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 02:43, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

::::::Certainly not clearly and explicitly. Back then, there was no such thing as a Canadian monarchy. The switch was made from a French to a British monarchy.

::::::::I am still not convinced, you are doing an improper synthesis of sources, let me explain. There have been an uninterrupted succession of '''monarchs''' (from different monarchies), true, but it only means that there was always a monarch reigning over (at least parts of) Canada. But it doesn't mean that the '''inheritance''' wasn't interrupted. The inheritance was clearly interrupted from the French to the British monarchy, I hope you don't contest that fact. We could also say that the specific monarchy of the time, the crown of France, was interrupted and replaced by an other specific monarchy, the British crown. Because it is a replacement of one monarchy by the other, we can say that the monarchy (as the general system of government with a monarch as the head), was uninterrupted. We can also say that "It is one of an approximate half-dozen that have survived through uninterrupted inheritance from before the country itself was founded", because the country was founded in 1867 and the inheritance is uninterrupted since about 1763. Seeing it this way, there are two definitions of the word "monarchy" here : one is specific, and the other is general. One could argue that the general monarchy, as applied to Canada, has roots in the French monarchy (on a few things, but not that much, such as the house of the governor general I think), but the specific monarchy of Canada doesn't, its roots are all British. I still think that we should avoid the words roots because of the possible confusion. In all cases, your blogspot article that refers to a Globe and Mail article is a POV, not a fact. The using of the word "roots" can't be presented as a fact. --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 17:33, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

Short blurbs from Canadian government departments are not a particularly good source on historical topics.  Typically, we like to talk about what historians say about history.  At any rate, the basic historical situation, which I don't think any of us disagree with, is that Canada was under the French monarchy, and then the British, and that the British rule developed into a distinct Canadin monarchy.  Whether the Canadian monarchy has any French roots or not, the British connection was obviously direct and clear, and implying that the Canadian monarchy's roots are equally French and British is nonsensical, no matter what the DCH says.  There's also a separate question of whether there was any continuity between the French monarchy and the British in Canada.  I don't know the answer to that question.  Was there crown land in French Canada that was taken up by the British crown after 1763, for instance?  Direct continuities like that would be worth mentioning in the article, so long as we don't imply equivalence.  [[User:John Kenney|john k]] ([[User talk:John Kenney|talk]]) 04:08, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:Something like this would be much better, although the definition of Canada is a POV, since Canada didn't exists before 1867. And the natives that lived in Canada in the 16th centuries weren't exactly subject of the French crown. What must absolutely be avoided is "roots" and "uninterrupted inheritance" (unless you have a source that say that the last French king gave it's inheritance to the first British). What about ''Parts of territory of modern day Canada have been claimed by monarch for centuries - first under the kings of France in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, then under the British Crown in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (and 20th also I guess???), and now as a kingdom in her own right.''  --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 13:28, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:::Ok first, give me a single source that says that the inheritance was uninterrupted when changing from the French monarchy to the British monarchy. You didn't bring any. It is true that the '''Canadian''' monarchy is still uninterrupted. But the Canadian monarchy didn't start in 1534. It was the French monarchy at the time. It was '''replaced''' by the British monarchy, which we can say then evolved into the current Canadian monarchy. Second, Canada had various meanings, the one you are referring to is going all the way down to Louisiana. So in this case we should also say that Canada is also in part ruled by the president of the USA. That would be ridiculous, of course, so it is much simpler to use my wordings.

== New proposition for section about the roots in British and French monarchies and uninterrupted of monarchy. ==

I propose that we replace the following section :
*''The Canadian monarchy has its roots in the French and British crowns, from which it has evolved over numerous centuries to become a distinctly Canadian institution[15] – one of the few crowns that have survived through uninterrupted inheritance''
By this
*'''''The Canadian monarchy has its roots in the British crowns, from which it has evolved to become a distinctly Canadian institution[15] – one of the few crowns that have survived through uninterrupted inheritance since the British conquest of New France.'''''

===1) It does not include other viewpoints===

This can't be considered as granting importance to one would be inherently against NPOV. Merely listing the nationalities without precedence, on the other hand, fits neatly into NPOV guidelines.

===3) 1534 is contested as the founding date of the Crown in Canada===
This is possibly a credible criticism, as the date of 1608 has been floated. However, the two sources provided are dicey in this regard; one doesn't actually say Canada was founded in 1608, and the other says so only as one answer to the question asked by the journalist about the age of the country. ''Canada has been a monarchy since the early 16th or 17th centuries'' is a possible alternative, or ''Canada has been a monarchy since at least 1534''.
:What about a source that say that Canada was founded in 1867? [http://www.canadafaq.ca/what+year+was+canada+founded/] I could probably find more if you need. Also, the first strictly Canadian crown was technically in what, the 20th century? That makes many possibilities of debate against the choice of 1534.

===4) The crown has not survived through uninterrupted inheritance===
This assertion also lacks supporting sources; argument that the change in monarch in 1763 marked a break in inheritance ignores the passing of the Crown in 1936 from one living monarch to another, and remains unsubstantiated opinion that does not counter a statement corroborated by multiple sources. It has been argued that the reading of those sources is incorrect, but no convincing alternate interpretation has been put forward. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 23:35, 1 March 2010 (UTC)
:What should be noted is that no reliable source support directly and explicitly the claim that the '''inheritance''' was uninterrupted since 1534.

Also, a succession of monarchs isn't exactly the same thing as a crown that "survived".

''outdent'' Again, because the sources don't literally say the same thing as one another doesn't mean they don't support one another. If you're going to continue to argue that I'm interpreting the sources wrong, even though you admit the crown "survived" i.e., as you put it, "didn't end", then you're really going to have to go to the next available step of dispute resolution. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 03:20, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

::I focus on it because the survival/continuance/endurance/perpetuation of the Crown in Canada from the early days of New France to the present is something you claim to be a monarchist fantasy, despite agreeing that the Crown did not end at any point between the 16th century and today. The only other thing you object to in your statement before last in this thread was the date of the foundation of the Crown in Canada, but, again, that's being discussed under point 3, not here. The succession of monarchs and the continuity of the Crown are one and the same; the crown cannot be said to have had an uninterrupted existence if the line of monarchs broke, and vice-versa. I have already repeated myself on this point umpteen times, and won't again. "Monarchical system of government" is possible as a replacement for "the Crown", but it remains to be explained why what can be summed up in two short words should be extended to four that include two long ones. The last I'll offer is this:
:::'''''Canada has been a monarchy since [date pending], the Crown having evolved under consecutive French, British, and then Canadian monarchs to become a distinctly Canadian institution, represented by...'''''
::Monet's comments on the length of the Crown's existence will be moved down to the end of the first paragraph of the History section as:
:::'''''According to historian Jacques Monet, the Canadian Crown is one of an existant few to have survived through uninterrupted succession since before its inception.'''''

:::The main problem with "The Crown", is that it is usually used to refer to the Canadian state, as explained in the article, and it didn't exist in 1760. What we are talking about here are "the monarchical institutions" or "a monarchical system of government", the only things which can be said to have "evolved" under a succession of monarchs of different houses and different nationalities. As explained in the article about [[The Crown]], it is a British concept that now also applies to commonwealth realms. Using it to refer to the French Crown in New France before 1763 is a revisionist POV. Next, Monet's comment can be presented as such (tough I don't find it really interesting if we don't even know what are the other crowns he is refering to), but I think that your current proposition contradicts itself by saying that the crown survived since before its inception (I understand it as "older than itself").

Comparing ''Louis XV to George III'' with ''Edward VIII to George VI'', is a poor comparison. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 20:40, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

:Indeed, it is a very silly one.  A monarch abdicating in favor of his heir is very different from a monarch ceding territory to another monarch.  When the Treaty of Tilsit gave all of Prussia's territories west of the Rhine to Napoleon's younger brother, did that mean that Jerome inherited the throne of the Duchy of Magdeburg from Frederick William III?  Did Peter the Great inherit Estonia from Charles XII?  Inheritance is one way for a territory to pass from one ruler to another (with abdication vs. death making no real difference), and cession by treaty is a completely different way for it to do so.  For example, Victor Emmanuel II inherited the throne of Sardinia when his father abdicated; he was also ceded Lombardy by Napoleon III, who had had it ceded to him at the same time by Franz Joseph.  But Victor Emmanuel didn't inherit Lombardy from either Napoleon III or Franz Joseph, nor did he inherit the throne of the Two Sicilies from Francis II.  There are many different ways for one monarch to transfer a territory to another, and inheritance is only one of them.

I'm not too well informed of the situation at hand here but I've been asked to give my thoughts by Mies. Maybe I'm completely off, but the situation here seems to be about the French, British crowns over Canada and if they it is a continuous uninterrupted monarchy from the French to the British to the Canadian Crown. I would say that Canada, in it's different forms throughout the centuries, as a colony of France then Britain, and as a British dominion, and finally today as an independent monarchy has had a continuous uninterrupted crown/monarchy reigning over it for several centuries now (although at some points the French ''and'' British crown reigned over parts of it). --~<font color=teal font face="Lucida Handwriting" font size=2>[[User:Knowzilla|Knowzilla]]</font>  <sup><font size="-2">[[User talk:Knowzilla|(Talk)]]</font></sup> 17:01, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

:During its colonial period Canada had two different crowns ruling it - the French and the British. There was no such thing as a Canadian Crown in those days, even as a legal construct, and there was no legal or constitutional connection between the French and British crowns, both being completely sovereign entities.

:Here's an analogy - would it be right to say that the British crown has an uninterrupted inheritance from the Roman monarchy? After all, the Roman monarchy ruled a large chunk of what is now the UK. The answer of course is no. The British crown is not descended from the Roman monarchy in any way at all. It is descended from early medieval and dark age polities that conquered the area of Britain ruled by the Romans. <font color="006200">[[User:TharkunColl|<small>ðarkun</small>]]</font><small>[[User_talk:TharkunColl|coll]]</small> 18:14, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

Hmmm... what it says now is "the Crown having evolved under an uninterrupted line of consecutive French, British, and then Canadian monarchs to become a distinctly Canadian institution". This isn't true. It implies that ''what became'' the Canadian crown began evolving under the French crown, when in fact there was a complete break.

===The Crown in Canada : no valid source as per WP:SELFPUB===
Does the use of "the Crown in Canada" to refer to the French crown in Canada before 1763 exists outside of the propaganda of the Canadian department of heritage? I understand it is a POV, but nothing more, and should not be described as an undisputed fact. It certainly does not present a worldwide view. For example, no French historian will say that their country created a concept called "the Crown in Canada". The [[treaty of Paris]] does only confirms the transfer of territories, and not a so-called Crown in Canada, from the French to the British Crown. Read the text [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/paris763.asp] There is not a single mention of "the Crown in Canada". Only the Crown of France and the Crown of Great Britain. Is there a single pre-1867 source that uses the concept "the Crown in Canada"? By looking at the British North America act of 1867 [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/1.html], we find that "Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under '''the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'''". --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 19:49, 5 March 2010 (UTC)
:What I refer to is the following policy : [[WP:SELFPUB]]. As per #2 ''it does not involve claims about third parties;'', a self-published source of the Canadian governement isn't good to claim that the Crown in Canada was established by France in 1534, as France is a 3rd party. Therefore, there is no acceptable source that talks about the Crown in Canada before 1763.

Canada has not been a monarchy since the 15th century; it has been ruled by two monarchies as a colony (or rather, ''colonies'') until it became a federated monarchy in its own right.

The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, and in Canada became a Canadian establishment, though it is still often denoted as "British" in both legal and common language, for reasons historical, political, and of convenience; this conflicts with the federal and provincial governments' recognition and promotion of a distinctly Canadian Crown.''

:::Much better. The link about the title now seems to work.

I'm open to adjusting the wording presently in the article, but only so long as it aligns with what's cited above. For instance, removing "uninterrupted line" means ignoring six sources. Saying "The former colonies that make up what is now known as Canada..." similarly overlooks three, possibly four, cites. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 12:37, 29 March 2010 (UTC)

:{{outdent|::::}}Not everything that is quotable should be quoted.Some of the quotes, on the face of it, don't make any historical sense:'The office of Governor General is the oldest continuous institution in Canada.' No, it isn't. Firstly because Canada as a united polity governed by a Governor General hasn't existed since 1867. Secondly, because the present office is a specifically Westminster institution. 'Canada has been a monarchy for centuries'. No, it hasn't. Firstly, for the same reason: it existed as a number of colonies each with their own governors until federation. And in another quote, this is, thankfully, made clear. Secondly, because it was ruled by monarchies, not a monarchy itself. The latter is a bit like saying the tail wags the dog.

'Canadian Heritage' does not say Canada has been a monarchy since 1534. It says Canada has been ruled by French and British monarchs since 1534, ''as a colony, or rather, a number of colonies''. But this is a moot point now since the sentence in question has been edited.

Even if all the sources were valid (which is far from true), the point isn't even proved, as explained before but I need to explain again since this is a new discussion:
* "Initially established under the... kings of France during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Canada's monarchical institutions..."1 p.12
doesn't prove the point. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. Also please note the difference between "Canada's monarchical institutions" and "Canada's monarchy". Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]].
* "[The monarchy's] roots lie in the establishment of New France... by King Francis I in 1534..."2
doesn't prove the point. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. Also note that it comes from a blog which is reporting an opinion article (from a monarchist, of course) in a newspaper. Not a history paper.
* "The office of Governor General is the oldest continuous institution in Canada and is an unbroken link with the early days of our country's recorded history."3
doesn't prove the point. The early days of our country's recorded history can mean 1867, the generally agreed date of the foundation of Canada. Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]].
* "Throughout Canada's evolution into statehood, there has been no more... enduring institution than the Crown."1 p.12
doesn't prove the point. The Crown can be enduring from 1763. Or even from later. Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]].
* "[T]he Canadian Crown is one of perhaps only a half-dozen still in existence that have survived in an uninterrupted inheritance from beginnings that are older than our Canadian institution itself."4 p.8
doesn't prove the point. Can mean since anytime before 1867, and not necessary before 1763. Source from a monarchist league which is the main defender of the uninterrupted line of succession, and single "Crown" since before a French or a British even set the foot on any part of modern Canada.
* "Canada has always had a monarch, since the time of King Henry VII of England and King Francis I of France."1 p.7
doesn't prove the point. A monarch was always there. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]].
* "The Crown in Canada was first established by the kings of France in the sixteenth century... The colonies that united and formed the Dominion of Canada in 1867 had already enjoyed a long and uninterrupted association with the Crown."1 p.16-17 [Note: no distinction between "British Crown" or "French Crown", merely "the Crown".]
doesn't prove the point. You skipped huge parts of the text. The long and uninterrupted association with the Crown can mean since 1763. Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]].
* "Under the Crown, Canada developed first as a colony of two empires, originally the French and subsequently the British, then as an independent dominion, and now as an entirely sovereign nation."5
doesn't prove the point. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]].
* "Since 1534, when the King of France claimed possession of what is now Canada, the history of our country has been marked by the reigns of an uninterrupted succession of monarchs, both French and British."5
This one is interesting. It contradicts many other sources, even from the government of Canada itself. It doesn't say that there was an uninterrupted succession between a British and a Canadian monarch. So either it was broken, or the current monarch is still a British one (shock, horror! in monarchist circles as it destroys their dream of a distinctively Canadian monarchy). I am sure that this is a mistake from the government, and as such can't be taken seriously. But if you do, you can make sure that I will use it to show that the current monarch is British, and not Canadian. The Canadian senate can't be wrong, doesn't it? :-)
* "The Office of The Queen (or King) is the oldest continuous and unbroken institution in Canada, extending not only through time to Confederation but back through the centuries... In 1534 Jacques Cartier made a... claim on behalf of France's King Francois I of the Royal House of Valois. In recognition of these beginnings, the heads of King Henry VII and King Francois I are carved over the doors to the House of Commons in Ottawa."6
doesn't prove the point. You skipped huge parts of the text. The oldest continuous and unbroken institution can mean since 1763. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. The propaganda of the governement means nothing, even if it is carved on the parliament. Anyway this source isn't valid as it is an amateur web site, an other monarchist league from what I understand.
* "Canada has been a monarchy for centuries - first under the kings of France in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, then under the British Crown in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and now as a kingdom in her own right."7
doesn't prove the point. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. Source by the government of the UK not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]] (as it imply a 3rd party: France)
* "Without interruption since the beginning of European settlement in Canada, a governor or governor general has been at the head of the country as the resident representative of the Crown.8
doesn't prove the point. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. The only thing said is that there have been different offices called governor, even if a French governor was a different legal concept than a British governor. Tertiary source.
* "Canada has been a monarchy since 1534, beginning with the French monarchs who reigned over New France, continuously down to the present day."9
doesn't prove the point. It doesn't mean that the line of succession wasn't interrupted. Source by the government of Canada not valid as per [[WP:SELFPUB]]. --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 02:35, 30 March 2010 (UTC)
::Yes, a number of those quotations are odd. This one is interesting: "[The Canadian Crown is one of perhaps only a half-dozen still in existence that have survived in an uninterrupted inheritance from beginnings that are older than our Canadian institution itself."4 p.8 That's from an overtly partisan monarchist publication. The author seems hesitant to make the statement, writing 'perhaps'. What does it mean? That monarchies preceded the present Canadian one? If so the same can be said of every existing Commonwealth monarchy. The same can be said of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, the Kingdom of the Belgians, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Principality of Monaco, the Vatican City State, the Kingdom of Brunei, the Sultanates of Malaysia, the Kingdom of Jordan, the Kingdom of Tonga, the Kingdom of Norway.

== Residences and Royal Household ==

Portland Island, which according to this article was the personal property of Princess Margaret and had been on loan to BC as a marine park, has now been incorporated into the new Gulf Islands National Park. I do not know precisely how this was done, but I know that a variety of small provincial parks, some other Crown land, and some land that was held directly by the Government of Canada was joined together. Establishing a national park requires that the land be set aside in perpetuity. I believe that it takes an Act of Parliament. Thus, the suggestion that Princess Margaret might have deeded this land to someone in her Will can be resolved by examining the Act. The plans for this new park were well under way before 2002 when the princess died, so perhaps she deeded it to the Crown. [[User:Njesson|Njesson]] 23:05, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

== NPOV lead ==

Following the edits by the newly arrived anon user, the lead is now not neutral: the anon has changed "since at least the end of the 15th century" to the selective "since the... turn of the 16th century." The sources clearly don't agree on the date, some saying 1534, others 1497.

The anon has also replaced "parts of what is now Canadian territory" with "some part of what is now Canadian territory"; I don't understand why he is claiming Canada grew out of one homogenous lump of a colony. If he's referring to the part of New France called "Canada", why the vague "some" before "part"? If he's referring to the various colonies, even within New France itself, why the use of the singular "part"?

The anon refuses to engage in discussion, though he has been asked twice to do so, though communication with him is problematic as he switches IPs. This is only worsening an already exasperating situation. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 12:10, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

However, this issue is academic, with the present wording. -- [[Special:Contributions/64.180.176.133|64.180.176.133]] ([[User talk:64.180.176.133|talk]]) 22:26, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Also, I don't agree at all with the foot note and I think that you misinterpret sources and cherry pick others. The references don't talk about the establishment of "the Crown in Canada", which have never been "established" as it means nothing. Back then, we were talking about the Crown of France or the Crown of the UK, and there was no reference to a canadian crown or a "Crown in Canada". All references to a "Crown in Canada" concept are modern and there is a reason for this : this is pure revisionism. Look at the text of the treaty of Paris. Does it say that the King of France gives the "Crown in Canada" to the British King? Of course not. Saying that Canada is a monarchy since 1534 doesn't mean that a "Crown in Canada" was established at this date, by the way. It should be understood as a synonym for a monarchical system of government. The legal concept of "The Crown in Right of Canada", however, was probably established in 1867. The foot note doesn't even talk about it. --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 16:30, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

:Taking the two objections in turn:
:The wording "...around the turn of the 16th century" is, in fact a ''neutral'' way of putting it, being (quite deliberately) non-committal as to whether before or after.  The key word is "around" -- "...''around'' the turn of the 16th century."   This word was left out of the quotation in the objection.
:Moving on to the business of "parts" or "some part": ''whenever'' it was that the first monarchical government originated within what is now Canadian territory, that government applied to "some part" of that territory -- just one part, at first, whichever part that was.  This became "parts" as English and French colonies (or colonial claims) proliferated.  This severalness (eventual, but not initial) is indicated by "...the founding of French and English colonies there...", just a few words further on in the same sentence.  There is ''no'' implication, much less any "claiming", that "Canada grew out of one homogenous lump of a colony"; such an interpretation of the sentence is altogether inconsistent with its mention of "French and English colonies".
:In both cases, far from being point-of-view, the wording states uncontroversial facts about Canadian history, simply and plainly, while staying ''deliberately'' non-committal about the debatable details -- that is, about which event should be seen as the first, and thus what is the more exact date and which was that first "some part".

::I see what you mean r.e. "around the turn of the 16th century"; this makes sense to me now.

::Because saying "the first establishment of the Crown in Canada" doesn't contradict "the whole territory of the country called Canada is *now* all governed by a monarchy"; the two statements are actually totally unrelated. You seem to ascribe to "Canada" and "the Crown" very narrow definitions not shared by the sources; of 13 cites, five explicitly refer to a crown/monarchy/monarch existing over "Canada" since around 1500, two refer to a governor over the same from the same approximate date. The authors and publishers of those works seemed confident that such wording wouldn't be confusing; it certainly isn't to me, and nobody else has had a problem with it until you came along.

:::That does not explain why you reverted my edit. The only source who talk about the "establishement" of "the Crown" is the revisionist propaganda document "A Crown of Maple" (which can't be used as per [[WP:SELFPUB]] as already said many times, see the other discussion where you never replied). Ironically, you use it *both* as a source for 1497 and 1534. All other sources use different words. To say that a monarch reigned over Canada, or even that Canada is a monarchy since 1534 is very different than saying that a Crown was established on this date. You are confusing what are sometimes synonyms, as described below. That's why I tried to replace "establishment of the Crown" by something more appropriate. No Crown was established in 1497 or 1534. No monarchical government or institutions were established either (as there was not even a governor). The only thing we can say is that parts of Canada were then claimed by kingdoms. Also, "The Canadian Royal Heritage Trust", as well as other monarchist blogs/web sites are *not* valid sources.

== The monarchy of Canada, The Crown in Right of Canada, etc ==

I am not sure that the introduction is right. Doesn't the monarchy of Canada refers to the complete system, as well as its line of succession, while "The Crown in Right of Canada", "Her Majesty in Right of Canada" and "The Queen in Right of Canada" are only legal concepts which only one part of the system? I don't think they are always synonyms. By looking at the content, this article is about the whole system, not only the legal concept. By looking at [[Monarchy of Australia]], [[Monarchy of the United_Kingdom]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands]] and [[Monarchy of Belgium]], I would say that this introduction might be a mistake. --[[User:Zorxd|zorxd]] ([[User talk:Zorxd|talk]]) 17:37, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

:I concur.  "The Crown in the Right of Canada", etc. are specifically legal concepts which are but one aspect of the Canadian monarchy.  In ''some'' contexts those terms might be used interchangeably with "the Canadian monarchy", but they are not fully congruent with it.  Generally, "the Crown in the Right of Canada", when translated from legalese, means "the Government of Canada", and relates to the monarchy only in the abstract, symbolic, theoretical, legal-fictional way that the the power of the federal government derives from the monarch.  The lead should not suggest that these terms are synonymous with "the monarchy of Canada". -- [[Special:Contributions/205.250.64.112|205.250.64.112]] ([[User talk:205.250.64.112|talk]]) 20:19, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

::::Thanks, this is a good first start, but I still think the rest of the introduction should be modified to reflect the idea discussed.
::::*''The monarchy of Canada is the constitutional system of government''
::::What is a constitutional system of governement? I don't think this expression is used a lot. Also I don't think it means much as pretty much every modern governement has a constitution, including many absolute monarchies, communist states, etc. We could say that it is a Westminster-style parliamentary constitutional monarchy (or something similar), which is the most precise way to describe the Canadian system.
::::*''in which a hereditary monarch is the sovereign and head of state of Canada,[1][2][3] forming the core, or "the most basic building block,"[4] of the country's Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.''
::::I think we should avoid advertising-like parts such as "the most basic building block". Also, what the source say is that "the Crown" is the most basic building block, not the monarchy as a system. We need to change that to reflect our previous discussion that they are not always synonyms.
::::*''The Crown is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Canadian government,[5][6][7] as well as the linchpin of Canadian federalism.''
::::Here the problem here is that "The Crown" is a concept which isn't defined. That sentence should be somewhere in the article, but only after "the Crown" is defined.

My version may not be a paragon of perfection, but it is certainly more concise and unambiguous.

Personally I keep my spelling errors. Most relevently, this is the same government responsible for the education that allows most of it's citizens to believe that the Head of State is the Prime Minister. Honestly, we have one of the most biased, ineffectual governments in the world, most of my friends vote towards the purpose of keeping it on a hung or minority government, so noone can screw things up. They are rather good at slinging their propoganda, so I would not say relialbe source in the least, and they certainly know nothing about history, its in the realm of spelling and knowing math (opposed to memorizing math tables, another of our education flaws).

== Constutiton of 1982 ==

There has been no new monarch since the repatriation of Canada. IN the ammending formula there is the requirement of unanimous consent for changes to the office of queen. What haas precedent in the event all legislatures do not, such as Quebec,give consent to Charles assumping the office. As it states any changes to the office of the queen require unanimous consent of the house of commons, senate, and provincial legislatures.

The Courts have further ruled that Quebec not signing the Constitution has no bearing on its legality.  As such, when Her Majesty dies, The Prince of Wales will immediately become King of Canada (And the other Commonwealth Realms) with no need for any actual recognition.  While the Privy Council in Canada will (Presumably) get together and proclaim him as such, and then further down the road he will have a coronation, none of it is required for him to ascend to the Throne.

Victoria was the first King/Queen of Canada?  What are the grounds for that statement?  Victoria was Queen of the UK and Empress of India.  Her rule in Canada was a result of her role as Queen of the UK.  You could ''maybe'' say her son was king of Canada, although he didn't use that title, due to the fact that he was King of the UK "and the dominions beyond the seas," but that seems like calling [[Charles IV of Spain]] King of Peru because among his titles was "King of the East an West Indies and the Isles and Mainland of the Ocean Sea," or whatever.  I don't see any justification for putting Elizabeth II in a line of kings and queens of Canada going back anywhere before George V, and even then I think it would probably be more accurate to see EII herself as the first King/Queen of Canada. [[User:John K|john k]] ([[User talk:John K|talk]]) 18:38, 29 December 2010 (UTC)

::::::Before 1867, "Canada" was a term - an alternate name for British North America - loosely applied to a collection of colonies and territories: Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, the Province of Canada, the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, the North-Western Territory, and Rupert's Land. Victoria was queen over all of those. But, on 1 July 1867, three of the aforementioned colonies - Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada - united to become an entity called Canada, which wasn't a colony like the others around it, being entirely self governing in internal matters. At the time, the Fathers of Confederation even wished to name this new polity the Kingdom of Canada, in recognition of its status in the Empire higher than a colony. Of course, "Dominion" was the term employed, which was then used for all other colonies in the Empire that gained the same status Canada did in 1867.
::::::Regardless, the point is that modern Canada came into existence in 1867 and Victoria was its first queen.

Canada in 1867 had more self-government than Jamaica at the same time, but both were essentially British colonies - I'm not sure I grasp the basis for the idea that Victoria was "Queen of Canada" but not "Queen of Jamaica."  I'd add that, before 1867, "Canada" pretty clearly meant the Province of Canada, specifically, and before that the separate provinces of Upper and Lower Canada.

Indeed Angus Ogilvy's [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1479803/Sir-Angus-Ogilvy.html obituary in the Daily Telegraph] describes him as a member of the Royal Family. There's no source cited for saying he isn't. Unless there's any other examples, I'm going to revert and amend the later reference to Ogilvy.

That emphasizes to me that claiming a "difference" between Canadian and British royal families is going to be misleading. I suppose claiming them as the same could be seen as OR without a specific source, but to be honest that is surely the obvious default position. Why should there be a difference?

There's an article on the [[British Royal Family]]. There is no formal definition. Canada and the UK share the same line of succession, but that would be too broad a definition. The most narrow definition would be to take simply those with a royal title (MH/HRH), but the general convention is also to include any immediate family members of those with an official style. That leaves about 25 members. Sir Angus therefore was, and Zara Phillips is, but Tom Parker Bowles and Viscount Linley are not even though they are close relatives.

# There are multiple images of the Queen (3), Prince Charles (3), and George VI (2) on this page.
# The image in question does not depict the couple on the same day as the other image showing them.
# The image illustrates the adjacent sentence "...officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other Canadian officials will take over from whichever of their other realms' counterparts were previously escorting the Queen or other member of the Royal Family."

I see no problem with replacing one of the photos of Prince William with a different one, whichever, to better reflect the text. However, if we include Charles, or talk about the succession within the article, then I feel that a photo of Prince William is absolutely fitting.

The remainder of the article is about the Monarchy and not the family/heirs and should have pictures representing the subject treated. Will and Kate picture (aka with the Mounties) is not relevant to the article or the section containing it.

"It is understood that the Canadian government will foot the two million dollar bill for that part of the tour as the Commonwealth country is one of the Queen's realms – meaning she is not a foreign monarch but the country's sovereign and head of state. This means that Prince William, 28, and the former Kate Middleton, 29, are members of the Canadian royal family and the country's authorities are taking the lead in organising the trip."- Telegraph.

== Monarchy in a federal system ==

How does a constitutional monarchy function within Canada's federal system? Is there, for example, the Queen in right of Ontario that is legally distinct from the Queen in right of Canada? How does this play out in legal cases between the Provinces and the Federation? Regina v Regina?   [[User:Petecollier|<font color="green">P M C</font>]] 22:25, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

: Fair question, the Queen is the head of government of Canada, represented at the federal level by the Governor General and at the Provincial Level by a Lieutenant Governor in each province. She would always be referred to as the "Queen of Canada" regardless of what province she is in. Ontario is part of Canada and the Queen of Canada is therefore Queen in Ontario; but there is no specific title "Queen of Ontario". [[User:Mediatech492|Mediatech492]] ([[User talk:Mediatech492|talk]]) 22:59, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

:According to [[Monarchy in Ontario]], she is known by several names in Ontario, including the Queen in Right of Ontario.  Though she acts as "Queen of Ontario", she is not titled as such, and Ontario is not considered a "kingdom".  Canada certainly has a singularly odd form of government.  By the way, when I was younger, I remember how Toronto Maple Leafs fans would stand and sing "God save the queen" whenever they played the Canadiens.  Always amused me as an American hockey fan.

::Yes that is correct, the "[[Monarchy_of_Canada#Federal_and_provincial_aspects|Crown]]" is legally distinct in each of the 11 jurisdictions (1 Federal and 10 Provincial). The Queen is head of state both federally and provincially, but not of government, that is the "First Minister" of each legislature, aka. the Prime Minister of Canada, or the Premier of each province (sometimes known as Prime Minister of the province also). In the US the president is both head of state and head of government, in Canada they are distinct, the government is responsible to the people, the monarch can not be the head of government as it is not an elected position. --[[User:UnQuébécois|UnQuébécois]] ([[User talk:UnQuébécois|talk]]) 03:22, 10 May 2012 (UTC)

:The refs are not necessary. I was merely illustrating the point using refs to provide an easy point of access to the material, and can be removed as appropriate. I don't see any need to remove the word 'official' as Queen of Canada is the official title and is used as such according to the [http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/TheQueensroleinCanada.aspx British Government], the [http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1331826436671 Canadian Government], as well as constitutional and legal scholars. Also, as an example of common official usage, the [http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1335366663206/1335366739264 Royal Portrait] has "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada". Evidently the simpler term "the Queen" is most often used, much in the same way that the 'Canadian Forces' is often used instead of 'Her Majesty's Canadian Armed Forces', or the 'Opposition' instead of 'Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition'. Such simplified forms do not detract from the official title. Also, I've never seen a simple "R" used as a title in common usage, so I fail to see your point on that one.

{{outdent}}You can certainly find examples of the usage of the term "Queen of Canada" although the most common usage is "Queen".  For example in the Constitution Act 1867 the term "Queen" is used almost entirely, although it also says, "Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland..." (preamble)  "R" is used in legal proceedings.  For example, if Smith is prosecuted for a crime, the case is referred to as "R v Smith".  Coins say "Elizabeth R".

In section "Succession and regency" another editor has undone a visible link to Perth Agreement[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=next&oldid=557359216] without rational explanation, as if it were shamefully taboo and not to be openly spoken in polite company or before the children or servants.

If that is accepted in principle, would the article's more longstanding editors consider the passages bolded below to be eligible for removal from the lead? ''Tentative suggestion for moves now added in italics.''

Per the Canadian constitution, the responsibilities of the sovereign and/or governor general include summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments. Further, Royal Assent and the royal sign-manual are required to enact laws, letters patent, and orders in council. '''But the authority for these acts stems from the Canadian populace and,[5][6][7] within the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance is limited, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected and appointed parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace.[5] The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power,[5][8][9] the sovereign acting as a custodian of the Crown's democratic powers and a representation of the "power of the people above government and political parties."[10][11]'''

===="...because..."====
The third sentence of the present lead is ambiguous. To a reader who does not already know what is meant, it looks as though it says that "several powers are the sovereign's alone because she lives predominantly in the United Kingdom". One way to avoid this inversion of fact and reason, would be to rewrite the sentence (in the present lead) to read:
* "The Queen lives predominantly in the United Kingdom and, while several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal governmental and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the Queen's representative, the governor general."

===Extract: Distinct Canadian Monarchy emerges===
By the end of the First World War, the increased fortitude of Canadian nationalism inspired the country's leaders to push for greater independence from the King in his British Council. An increasingly unique Canadian monarchy began to emerge, firstly through the Statute of Westminster, which was granted Royal Assent in 1931.[264][265] Only five years later, Canada had three successive kings in the space of one year, with the death of George V, the accession and abdication of Edward VIII, and his replacement by George VI. However there was still no "King of Canada" at this point in time.[266] The monarch's title was the same everywhere she reigned and was "﻿By the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith"

George VI became in 1939 the first reigning monarch to tour the country (though previous kings had done so before their accession). As the ease of travel increased, visits by the sovereign and other Royal Family members became more frequent.

Elizabeth II became the reigning monarch on 6 February 1952. Initially she reigned under the traditional title of the Monarch. Then something remarkable happened. On 28 May 1953, by a prerogative act of the Sovereign, Elizabeth II adopted a unique Style and Title with respect to her distinct office as Sovereign in Canada. This act was one of royal perogative.[267] It was not done by way of Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was done with the assent of the Canadian parliament given through the Royal Styles and Titles Act 1953.[268]

The nature of the Sovereign had evolved. She now had an entirely distinct personality with respect to Canada. She was "Queen of Canada", her royal title being "By the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith". For the first time ever, Canada was no longer implicitly described as a "British dominion beyond the Sea" in the Sovereign's title.[269] The contemporary monarchy of Canada had finally come into being. The title reflected Canada's status as a sovereign realm, not a British dominion. Moreover, the title now implicitly described Canada as a "realm" rather than as a dominion because it refers to "other Realms".
:My [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=561373139&oldid=561299808 edit summary] was fairly explanatory. Also, see [[Title and style of the Canadian monarch]].

This case confirmed that the Queen of the UK and the queen of Gibraltar were separate persons.

As Denning wrote, "Indeed, independence, or the degree of independence, is wholly irrelevant to the issue, because it is clear that rights and obligations of the Crown will arise exclusively in right or respect of any government outside the bounds of the United Kingdom as soon as soon as it can be seen that there is an established government of the Crown in the overseas territory in question."

Notice that the Queen is queen of each and every territory where an administration has been established, in this case she is queen of the [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]].

'''Support 2'''  See Colin Coates (2006). ''Majesty in Canada: Essays on the Role of Royalty''. Dundurn. p. 143.
:Upon her accession on February 6, 1952, all Commonwealth countries shared the same title for their monarch. At the Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers held in Decemober 1952, all member countries agreed to pass appropriate legislation for altering the styles and titles in their respective parliaments....[Governor-General Vincent] Massey himself said that appointing "a Canadian [himself] makes it far easier to look on the Crown as our own and on the Sovereign as Queen of Canada." The Royal Styles and Titles Act for Canada was approved by the Canadian parliament and was established by royal proclamation on May 29, 1953. The new style of the Queen was proclaimed as follows: "Elizabeth the Second, by the grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and her other realms and territories, Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith."[http://books.google.ca/books?id=XH8caMA1E0QC&pg=PA143&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true]

See also the "Royal Style and Titles Act" in the ''Revised Statutes of Canada'', 1985 c. R-12.
:"The assent of the Parliament of Canada is hereby given to the issue by Her Majesty of Her Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of Canada establishing for Canada the following Royal Style and Titles, namely: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith."[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/R-12/page-1.html]

Every other Commonwealth realm except Grenada has changed the title to remove the United Kingdom from the title, and Canadian sources sometimes use the title "Queen of Canada," although "the Queen" is the most usual term used. In constitutional law, her position is queen (lower case) of Canada and of each of the ten Canadian provinces.

* '''Support  <strike>2</strike> 1''', but with this caveat: While we may each be fairly clear about this in our own minds, are we using - meaning - intending - understanding "title" in the same way here? And what could an unsuspecting reader be expected to make of it? Is "Queen" in "Queen of Canada" unambiguously a "title" in a context when a formally prescribed title (in long or short form) would be expected? Based on nothing more or better than such knowledge as I have, and on my opinion and belief, my view is that in the context of this article we need not, and should not unless we must, write of the usage "Queen" of Canada as a title, unless sufficiently sourced by proponents, and <strike>so far</strike> that seemed to have been lacking. I note that the article [[Title]] has a table which includes Queen as "Common in larger sovereign states". Not conclusive, but some indication if further supported. Wiktionary offers: "1_A prefix (honorific) or suffix (post-nominal) added to a person's name to signify either veneration, official position or a professional or academic qualification. 2_(law) Legal right to ownership of a property; a deed or other certificate proving this. ...".

'''Support 1''': It's not necessary or appropriate to go into deail about the sovereign's title in the lead, which is intended to summarise this article, which is itself an overview page on the Canadian monarchy; the monarch's title by law, among other related subjects, is covered at [[Title and style of the Canadian monarch]], which is currently piped from the words "Queen of Canada" in the lead. The wording in the lead here "For Canada, the current monarch is officially titled Queen of Canada (French: Reine du Canada)" was in place for years without incident. Regardless of whether or not the word "official" stays or goes, the prhase "the current monarch is titled Queen of Canada" is accurate, as affirmed by various sources:

::I have not found the academic or governmental sources convincing on the point at issue here. The usage Queen of Canada by officials, commentators and others, and by the Queen herself, is not in doubt, any more than in any realm she can be, and frequently is, referred to as "the Queen" or as "the Queen of (...that realm...)". It is whether it is apt for the lead to be needlessly calling this the monarch's ''title'' that is in question. The reasons advanced by Mies. in support of 1. appear to me to argue in support of 2. Mentioning the title, long or other, is unnecessary detail for the lead, particularly because it is contentious and has so much citation. But I am persuaded by '''the forms prescribed by statute for the oaths of allegiance''': to me, that is decisive '''in support of 1.''',  provided that these are used for the citations (possibly with some explanatory annotation), whether this passage is retained in the lead, or (preferably) moved into the body.

: MIESIANIACAL provides a link to a government website that says,  "In 1953, a Canadian law, the Royal Style and Titles Act, formally conferred upon Elizabeth II the title of 'Queen of Canada'."  But the actual act, which is quoted above says, "The assent of the Parliament of Canada is hereby given to the issue by Her Majesty of Her Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of Canada establishing for Canada the following Royal Style and Titles, namely: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith."[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/R-12/page-1.html]  Other secondary sources confirm this.  If some secondary sources incorrectly report what a primary source says, and other sources correctly report it, then we must go with what the law actually says.

::The Royal Style and Titles as prescribed in the Act is legal prose bestowing more than a single title: "establishing for Canada the following Royal Style and Titles", note that it does not say "establishing for Canada the following title", but "Style and Titles". There is confusion here on what constitutes an official title, and what constitutes legal style and titles. The official title as used by all of the pertinent political, official, and non-political actors, is the Queen of Canada.

::The quote provided by Prime Minister St. Laurent dating from 1953 was an expression of the common understanding of the time, that of an indivisible, or only semi-divisible Crown. To rely on such a sentiment today however, is to ignore the continued evolution of Canadian Constitutional affairs. Since that time, the Canadian constitution has continued along a path of increasinging independence, culminating in the Constituion Act of 1982. Subsequently, today, contrary to St. Laurent's understaning at the time, the Queen of Canada is a separate office. Such a change in an official title does not require a law or order in council. Legal title and official title are not necessarily one and the same. For example, I think most would agree that the title of Prime Minister of Canada is quite official, even though it is not legally so, or any more of a legal title than Chief Minister or First Minister. As for your request for legal references there is [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/30.html Sue v. Hill [1999<nowiki>]</nowiki>] which states that "in matters of law and government the Queen of the United Kingdom, for example, is entirely independent and distinct from the Queen of Canada", as well as [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/journals/ALRS/2003/2.html?query=%221982%20QB%20892%22%20or%20%221982%202%20All%20ER%20118%22%20or%20%221982%202%20WLR%20641%22 [2003<nowiki>]</nowiki> ALRS 2] stating "the difficulty arose because of a lack of clear understanding of the difference between the Queen’s position as Queen of Canada and Queen of the United Kingdom. It would be as inappropriate for the Prime Minister of Canada to advise the Queen of the United Kingdom (on any matter), as it would be for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to advise the Queen of Canada". As well, there is [http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=Mac+Giolla+Chainnigh&language=en&searchTitle=Canada+%28Federal%29&path=/en/ca/fct/doc/2008/2008fc69/2008fc69.html&searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAUTWFjIEdpb2xsYSBDaGFpbm5pZ2gAAAAAAAAB 2008 FC 69], with "The role of the Queen in relation to Canada is succinctly described in the Oaths of allegiance and citizenship as the Queen of Canada". As you can see, the assertion that the Queen of Canada, as an office, is inextricably linked to the office of the Queen of the United Kingdom is no longer true. The legal prose describing the Style and Titles of the Canadian Monarch is not the '''official title''', but the '''legal style and titles''' which were passed under a now superceded constitutional order. The assumption that the Queen of Canada is an official title is a fact, and cannot be reasonably debated. This is not a debate about title, but one of stylistic or editorial preference. In the lead to a general article on the Monarchy of Canada, do we use the full legal phrase from a Canadian Act passed in 1953, or do we use the much simpler and more readily recognised official title, reflecting current legal and official usage?

:::The divisibility of the Crown was decided in an EWCA case in 1982, although New Zealand had already changed the sovereign's title to "Queen of New Zealand" in the [[Royal Titles Act 1974]].  However none of this has relevance to the sovereign's ''title'' in Canada, because it is determined by parliament.  It may be that they picked the wrong title and perhaps we can petition them to change it, but this is not the place to begin that process.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 05:27, 30 May 2013 (UTC)

::::First, no one was discussing New Zealand. I offered legal cititions describing the Queen of Canada from a variety of commonwealth sources, which has absolute relevance. Second, "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Her other Realms and Territories, Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith" is not a title. '...of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Her other Realms and Territories...' is a descriptive style. Queen is a title, Head of the Commonwealth is a title, and Defender of the Faith is a title. Taken collectively, they are the legal style and titles of the Canadian monarch. Thus, legally, the title of 'Queen' is just as valid as the title of 'Defender of the Faith' in Canada, although 'Defender of the Faith', while legal, has no official grounding in Canadian constitutional practice. The Act does not specifically give the title of 'Queen of X', but merely 'Queen' (in addition to the two other titles) in order to reflect the then constitutional realities. Subsequently, Queen of Canada finds its '''legal''' grounding in the Acts' bestowing of the title of 'Queen', and its '''official''' grounding through constitional principle and legal practice. Even a cursory study of Canadian constitutional law will show you that written laws are often and easily superceded by constitional principle. While I am approaching the subject from the vantage point of what is ''official'', and not from what is purely ''legal'', the Act, contemporary legal cases and articles, as well as current official usage and practice, all point to the same conclusion. This leads me to state once again that this is a stylistic debate, and not a factual one. [[User:Trackratte|Trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 06:10, 30 May 2013 (UTC)
:::::The RfC is about what the monarch is ''titled'', not the constitutional role.  Hence people in Ontario do not call the governor-general the "Governor-General of Ontario", we do not say that the American colonists rebelled against the King of America, etc.  I do not know what you mean by "written laws are often and easily superceded by constitional principle."  Laws remain in force until repealed or found to be in violation of the constitution.  But the Canadian Constitution clearly refers to the "Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" as Canadian sovereigns.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 06:43, 30 May 2013 (UTC)

:::::: Ignoring your strawman arguments, you raise a valid point of confusion for many people with regards to aspects of the written Constitution. However, the Supreme Court of Canada illustrates this point in [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii793/1998canlii793.html [1998<nowiki>]</nowiki> 2 SCR 217], stating "The Constitution is more than a written text.  It embraces the entire global system of rules and principles which govern the exercise of constitutional authority.  A superficial reading of selected provisions of the written constitutional enactment, without more, may be misleading.  It is necessary to make a more profound investigation of the underlying principles animating the whole of the Constitution..." which includes both written and unwritten aspects, as well as constitutional convention (such as responsible government as one example). Thus, the title of the monarch as outlined in the Constition Act of 1867, while still remaining legal, has no relevance on the current official title of the Canadian Monarch. In any event, I think we are delving into more depth here than required, and we'll see what stylistic consensus we can eventually come to.

::::::: The title of the monarch was dictated by the UK Titles Acts which as imperial legislation were part of the Canadian constitution.  However the 1953 agreement allowed the Canadian parliament to change the title, which they did.  The argument that the constitution must be read in light of previous practice does not work.  There was no constitutional practice of referring to the monarch as the "Queen of Canada", in fact the monarch was referred to as "by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith."

:::There seems to be pause enough in this interesting duologue to permit other comment. ''Style or fact''? Those are not entirely separable in this matter. I don't think the somewhat amorphous or credal notion of the indivisibility or divisibility of the Crown should be used in the article as if it turned on the question of "Queen" as title. Talking of titles, Twomey's book is certainly well-named ''The Chameleon Crown''. It is the variously changing usage and associated sentiment and political inclinations, from context to context and time to time, which colour the discussion here, and among Canadians who have taken sufficient interest in such things (exemplified, for instance, by ''an expression of the common understanding of the time, that of an indivisible, or only semi-divisible Crown''). It is this which should be reflected in the article, and soapboxing (even of the gentler kind) avoided. But that should be done as concisely as can be, referencing details in other linking articles and avoiding cluttering the lead with an issue which, important in itself, is not the main point of the article. The wording of the '''oaths of allegiance''' is legal and prose but simple enough for the immediate understanding of anyone capable of speaking the language, and leaves little room for quibbling (but the theory and practice of ''allegiance'' is another matter). Gladstone, on the UK prime ministerial office, remarked "Nowhere is there a man who has so much power with so little to show for it in the way of formal title or prerogative". Words such as prime minister, queen and king signify a particular ''function'' in a given written or unwritten constitution: does a word become a ''title'' when spoken before a monarch's name or when, like a book, written with an initial capital before the person's name? Is "Queen Mother" to be considered a title without constitutional function, as it were "Emeritus"? Was she "Queen Mother" in Canada? Questions of style or fact? While I can see TFD's reasoning, I can accept that ''the Queen of Canada is an official title is a fact'' due to the oaths of allegiance prescribed for Canada. That tips it for me, and lets the point be settled free from commentator's or editor's personal but speculative reasoning, '''superseding''' (sic) '''my earlier support for 2'''.

::::Titles such as "The Queen Mother" are bestowed by the sovereign.

::::This RfC seems to have turned into nothing more than a continuation of the same argument that took place in the preceeding section. That said, I still fail to see what the issue now is: the lead presently says the monarch is titled ''Queen of Canada'' and enough reliable sources have been found to support that fact. I think TFD's rationale behind his want is anything but rational; "King of America"? "Governor General of Ontario"? Comments from 1953? Questioning the divisibility of the Crown? Extinct titles of British monarchs? Of what relevance is any of that? Does he think stating the monarch is titled ''Queen of Canada'' is some ploy to hide the full title and style set out in law?
::::Clearly both ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith'' and ''Queen of Canada'' can be found in acts of the Canadian parliament. But, again, we don't need to go into detail about all this here, ''especially'' not in the lead! Some very basic summary is all that's required. So, if TFD inisists on giving some reference to the long title and style in the lead of the article, we could perhaps consider the following:
:::::"For Canada, the current monarch is titled ''Queen of Canada'' (French: ''Reine du Canada''), an abbreviated form of her [[Title and style of the Canadian monarch|full Canadian style and title]]",
::::or
:::::"For Canada, the current monarch is titled ''Queen of Canada'' (French: ''Reine du Canada''), derived from her [[Title and style of the Canadian monarch|full Canadian style and title]]",

{{outdent}}This seems to be getting somewhat out of hand, and I sincerely hope it's just me who's being obtuse, but my interpretation of TFD's last comment, excluding the Denning quote, is nonsensical gibberish. With reference to the wide variety of reputable sources (Supreme Court of Canada, Federal Court, legal papers, laws, government publications, etc) and the discussions already had, the fact that the Queen of Canada is the Canadian Monarch's official title in Canada is no longer a matter of debate. Even the long style and titles, is not, in itself a title as I previously explained, but a descriptive style along with multiple different titles (and is generally reserved for only the most formal of writings or occasions, and is subsequently unsuitable for a Wikipedia lead). Also, in the sentence itself, the part "For Canada" seems to me to be redundant, as this is obviously an article about Canada, and second the phrase doesn't seem to logically flow from the previous one. I would suggest something along the lines of: 
:"The current Canadian Monarch has been, since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II. Although the person of the sovereign is equally shared with fifteen other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled as the Queen of Canada ''(piped to full style and titles article)'', and in this capacity she, her consort, and other members of the Canadian Royal Family undertake public and private functions domestically and abroad as representatives of the Canadian state."

:::Show me a credible reference that states that the Queen of Canada's title includes "Kingdom of the United Kingdom". Unless of course you're simply mistakenly referring to the Royal Style as per the Royal Style and Titles Act, in which case it's irrelevant to the title in question. Once again, we're conflating two different things. It's the Royal Style and Titles Act, not the Royal Title Act. The Royal Style, and the Royal Titles (plural) are not one and the same. In case I haven't been clear, "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories" is not a title (it's a royal style), where Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, and Defender of the Faith certainly are. Of these three titles, only one is applicable as an official and uniquely ''Canadian'' title, as Head of the Commonwealth is not Canadian but international, and Defender of the Faith has no official relevance within Canada. Therefore the only applicable legal title suitable for official use within a uniquely Canadian context is that of Queen. Just as the official title of any Canadian prime minister is the '''Prime Minister of Canada''', so to is the official title of any Canadian queen as the '''Queen of Canada'''. The difference being that the official title of Prime Minister of Canada, while official, has no legal basis, whereas the title of the Queen of Canada does. In addition, an official title does not have to reflect a legal act, or have any legal basis once so ever in order to be official. Unless of course you mean to say that the title of Prime Minister of Canada is not official, in which case it's your definition of 'official' that is the crux of the issue, and nothing else.

==the existence of a Canadian Royal Family==
The article says, "Still, the existence of a Canadian Royal Family is contested, mostly by individuals in Canada's [[Republicanism in Canada|republican movement]], but also by former [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]] [[Iona Campagnolo]]."  [http://www.filibustercartoons.com/lg.htm Here] is a link to the source.  This is strange wording.  No one doubts the existence of the Royal family.

== Royal Arms ==

Reverted to status quo (no arms due to adm decision not to allow the official Arms on this article). I'm not too sure what the general consensus will be, but I don't think that the particular depiction of the Arms just added should be part of this article. 
# This particular image has been discussed on a variety of pages before, and every time it was added it was taken out, with the consensus being that it should not be used on the English Wiki due to its being a generally horrible depiction (although this may have changed, I believe Fry1989 was spearheading its removal).
# I don't see how this image's inclusion in the article adds anything of value, if not actually taking away value due to its being misleading. Does having the Arms add anything to the article? If they do, then the argument should be made that that the fair-use allowed for the [[Canada]] article be extended to this one. If this depiction is in fact necessary, then it should be no problem providing rationale for fair-use for the official Arms within this article. If such a rationalisation cannot be made for the Arms, then I fail to see why we should then include a lesser, misleading version in their stead. 
# It is still not clear that these non-official Arms even qualify as fair-use. The Canadian Crown Copyright office (email in deletion request) maintains that the 1994 and 1957 Arms are under Crown Copyright.

== Added comment ==

Canada is not a monarchy.  I have found this article and realized that it classifies Canada as a monarchy.  According to www.thefreedictionary.com, a monarchy requires the monarch to "govern" or "rule" the nation<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/monarchy</ref>, the same information is given by this site under "Monarchy"<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy</ref>; however, Canada does not give the monarch any such powers.  The monarch is just a figurehead.  The government of Canada is more of a parliamentary democracy, as it has a parliament and is a democratically ran government (which is supported by thefreedictionary.com<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/parliamentary+democracy</ref> and Wikipedia<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system</ref> under the search of parliamentary democracy).    <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Digimaster002|Digimaster002]] ([[User talk:Digimaster002|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Digimaster002|contribs]]) 05:18, 4 November 2013 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The history seems to involve a double fudge:
:::FUDGE (1). At least by the 1930s, when the big British colonies were beginning to assert themselves as equal partners of the mother country, the question arose of whether there was still one imperial crown or whether it was now "divided" among the mother country and the dominions.  Fine minds were wracked over the idea of "divisibility of the Crown" and the very idea of "the Crown" acquired a chameleon-like character:  Anne Twomey, ''The Chameleon Crown'' (2006).  The matter was fudged by speaking of the monarch "in right of" the UK, Canada and so on.  This phrase may also have been in use already, as it still is, to distinguish "the Crown" in Canada and Australia as a component of federal and of either provincial or state law.  The key issue on that level was whether a statute would "bind the Crown in right of ...";  e.g. could a provincial or state law tax federal property?  The expression "in right of" is several centuries old, possibly found at least as far back as the 10th century, although as an expression in private law. Thus: "1655 ... He possessed fair lands in Anjou and Maine; by Match '''in right of''' Queen Elianor his Wife" and "1745 ...  The Abbot of St. Augustine in Canterbury, '''in Right of''' his Abbatie, had ''Cuneum Monetæ'', Allowance of Mintage and Coinage of Money" (''Oxford English Dictionary'' online, emphases added).  Possibly, then, "in right of" has always been chameleon-like, referring to different kinds of relation according to context.  One needn't expect the common law to be consistent.
:::FUDGE (2). How, then,  to translate "in right of" into French, given that in France no question of "divisibility of the Crown" had arisen?  Recourse seems to have been had, again, to private law:  e.g. ''du chef de sa femme'', in his wife's right (or, if you like, in right of his wife); cp ''Collins-Robert French-English English-French Dictionary'' (2nd edn 1987), French "chef"2(b).  Then some writers, either not seeing this option or not being satisfied with it, have preferred ''aux droits de'', literally (I attempt) "with the rights of" (thank you, [[User:NotWillyWonka|NotWillyWonka]]). I doubt that there would be a conceptual difference between "in  right of Canada" and "in right of (the province of) Quebec", so one could say in French "du chef du Canada" and "du chef de Québec" or "aux droits du Canada" and "aux droits de Québec".  But ''du chef de'' seems to be preferred. [[User:Wikiain|Wikiain]] ([[User talk:Wikiain|talk]]) 22:19, 21 January 2015 (UTC)
::::I do not think that "in right of" here means the same thing as in [[Jure uxoris|"in right of the wife"]].  "in Right of his Abbatie" merely means that the archbishop had certain rights because he was also an abbot.  And while in legal theory, the Crown was indivisible, in practice it was not.  So any idea what "in right of" means or when it arose?  Incidentally, google translate uses "chef" to translate in queen in right of and "droit" to translate husband in right of.  Latin is "regina in ius".  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 04:55, 22 January 2015 (UTC)
:::::Thank you for the link to "in jure uxoris":  another level of translation!  I would have hardly a clue about the abbot, given especially that he might have been a corporation sole and in addition (to my recollection of a book somewhere) a church itself could also have legal personality.  For theory/practice about the Crown,  please see Twomey's excellent book - her central contention is that the practice was not a consistent application of any theory.  That is why I'm talking about fudging.  For when "in right of" arose, I searched the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in its current, online edition and quoted two of its examples. Let's stay away from Google Translator:  I find it very unreliable. [[User:Wikiain|Wikiain]] ([[User talk:Wikiain|talk]]) 23:06, 22 January 2015 (UTC)

Your complaint that my wording is too specific there is unfounded; it does a good job as it is, in a lead-like way, unlike your undo which is a poor botch needing to be edited out.[[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 19:45, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
:::Well, I'd agree poor wording needs revision. But, replacing poor wording with other poor wording isn't any improvement; especially inaccurate or misleading poor wording. And I don't see any poor wording there now, anyway.
:::Your desired composition is indeed too specific, as well as half-done and misleading. Aside from unnecessarily repeating "governor general", it doesn't relay proper information (stating only the governor general has responsibilities as set by the constitution and only the governor general can appoint a government or dissolve parliament). Stating solely what the governor general can do gives just part of the picture. To complete the picture requires adding information on what the monarch alone and the monarch or governor general can do. Adding all that detail into the lede contravenes [[WP:LEDE]]. "[T]he monarch and/or the governor general" imparts that sometimes one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both can carry out the Crown's constitutional responsibilities, including X, Y, and Z. The detail of who can do/does what is covered in the article proper, which adhere's to the guidelines on writing ledes. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 20:37, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

::::Whether or not your points of criticism are wholly or partly justified (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is not admitted) my wording was an attempt to improve on the existing undoubted botch, and it was open to you to improve by tweak or a complete rewrite.

::::::::Yes, getting away from 'and/or' is certainly an improvement on the existing, and funnily enough I had made a similar (unposted) draft some time earlier. It would be better still if it did not wrongly seem to hint that the monarch and the governor general are responsible in the same way, which may be well enough understood by those that know, but not by all who see it. That was what I wanted to avoid; and I don't think 'functions' or 'duties' would do either, or some circumlocution or archaic phrase.

::::::::::::Thank you for identifying the part of the body you consider supports the lead, by its general reference to the Crown.  The website linked in the infobox puts it well:[http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1396015117980/] ''In today's constitutional monarchy, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is Queen of Canada and Canada's Head of State. She is the personal embodiment of the Crown in Canada. In Canada’s system of government, the power to govern is vested in the Crown but is entrusted to the government to exercise on behalf and in the interest of the people. The Crown reminds the government of the day that the source of the power to govern rests elsewhere and that it is only given to them for a limited duration.'' This means that to simplify the lead in the manner customary to Wikipedia we should now have:

{{od}}All I said was keep in mind what "the Crown" reads when reading parts of the article. The term "the monarch" is also used.

I think it's better to give notion of the fact some powers can be exercised by the monarch alone, some by the governor general alone, and some by either; i.e. it's not just that either representative of the Crown can exercise any power. You objected to some perceived disconnect between the article body and the lede.

:Maybe, but of the two mine (with the Crown) is the one that is actually supported by article content.  Lacking anything in the current article, or something outside it which can be inserted, that version should now go in, or if preferred this:  "The duties of the  governor general, acting in the name of the monarch, include summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments." That is certainly found in the Constitution cited later on. This latter version, as before said, would follow on well from the end of the first paragraph, distinguishing for the reader the vice-regal position of the governor general in connection with the federal parliament from the position of the lieutenant governors.

===A proposed re-wording for the lead's 2nd paragraph===
After the comments made in the course of discussion in this section and on this page, I am inclined to see the following version as the one to adopt, subject to any reasoned comment from others:

*Included in the powers and duties of [[the Crown]] of Canada are those of the governor general, acting in the name of the monarch, for the summoning and dismissing of parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments.

This version would follow on well from the end of the first paragraph, distinguishing for the reader the vice-regal position of the governor general in connection with the federal parliament from the position of the lieutenant governors
[[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 23:45, 13 February 2015 (UTC)
: The Governor General's role is already summarized (And the LGs for that) and mentioned in the previous paragraph, why are we re-stating and making the lede more wordy and over specific? It's a lede, a "synopsis" of the article, the details are expanded upon in the article. Most of the second paragraph does not need to be in the lede, a simple: "Some of the constitutional responsibilities of the Monarchy are: dismissing parliament, calling elections, appointing governments, and granting Royal Assent to bills." would sum up the whole paragraph. Put that in the first paragraph just before the statement about the GG and LG, remove the second, and split the first so it's not so "cluttered" and on we go. Everything else is way too much detail for a lede section. --[[User:NotWillyWonka|NotWillyWonka]] ([[User talk:NotWillyWonka|talk]]) 04:36, 14 February 2015 (UTC)

::I happily agree with NotWillyWonka's reasoning, and if the simplification were adopted, it would (as I understand it) involve putting one sentence in place of the whole second paragraph. Overlaying that one sentence on the first two sentences of the current version looks like this:
:::Some of the constitutional responsibilities of the Monarchy are: <strike>By the Canadian constitution, the responsibilities of (depending on the circumstance) the monarch, governor general, or either include</strike> summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections, appointing governments, and granting Royal Assent to bills.<strike>Further, Royal Assent and the royal sign-manual, are required to enact laws, letters patent, and orders in council.</strike>

::The first paragraph doesn't touch at all on what the governor general or the monarch do. The second paragraph does. The second paragraph summarises the entire "Federal constitutional role" section, according to [[WP:LEDE]]. A one sentence paragraph does not; see [[WP:LEADLENGTH]]. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 23:12, 14 February 2015 (UTC)

===2nd  proposed re-wording (for the lead's 2nd paragraph)===
In view of the above discussion, and given the present version of the article as recently revised, there seems to be no reason against accepting the following clarification (overlaid on the present version): 
:''longer version''
:By the [[Canadian constitution]], the <strike>responsibilities of the sovereign and/</strike> powers of the Crown are exercised by the monarch or governor general <strike>include</strike>, including summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments.

It could be shortened to read simply:
:''shorter version''
:The powers of the Crown are exercised by the monarch or governor general,  including summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments.

In itself, that is a bald statement but factually correct, and sufficient for the lead, given than the details are in the main body. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 16:03, 15 February 2015 (UTC)

:How is that a clarification? It isn't entirely wrong (as there's no power that's exercisable by the governor general and the monarch simultaneously; it's either or), but, it implies that every element of the Royal Prerogative can be exercised by either the monarch or governor general, which isn't true. Some is exercisable only by the monarch (e.g. creating honours, appointing governors general, appointing additional senators), some only by the governor general (e.g. appointing privy councilors, appointing supreme court justices, summoning parliament), and some by either (issuing royal proclamations, dissolving parliament, granting Royal Assent).

::That's heplful. If I understand  it aright, it means: Some of the powers of the Crown are exerciseable by the monarch and not by governor general: these are, or include, creating honours, appointing governors general, and appointing additional senators. Other powers of the Crown are exerciseable by the governor general, but not the monarch, including appointing privy councillors, appointing supreme court justices, summoning  parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments. Other powers which are ''exerciseable'' by either the monarch or the governor general, namely, issuing royal proclamations, dissolving parliament, and gving or withholding royal assent to parliamentary bills, would be ''exercised'' by one but not the other of them on any  specific occasion. One way to put all that into a simple comprehensive statement would be: 
:::The powers of the Crown are exercised by the monarch or the governor general.
::''Anything'' more than that cannot avoid seeming to say (depending on pov) too little or too much. So the question is: Why does the current version select 'summoning and dismissing parliament, calling elections, and appointing governments', cast in that awkward 'and/or'  form, which tends to opacity more than clarity? If examples are needed there, it would be better to have at least one of each, thus: 
:::Some of the powers of the Crown are exercisable by the monarch (such as appointing governors general), others by the governor general (such as calling parliamentary elections), and some others by either of them (such as gving or withholding royal assent to parliamentary bills).

== "continually" in "Federal and provincial aspects" ==

The section 'Federal and provincial aspects' includes an opaque sentence which, perhaps in an attempt to paraphrase or compress, conflates or confuses certain distinct concepts: the Crown, continuity, section 9 of the Constitution Act, and the constitution including all the practices and conventions not set forth explicitly in the Act or other positive law. The sentence is: 

:''The Crown, continually vested by section 9 of the constitution with the executive government and authority for the whole of Canada, thus links the various governments into a federal state....''[[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=next&oldid=647097124]] 

Unhappily, that so lacks precision that it is quite hard to discern what it was intended to mean. It stems from a recent edit of 23:06, 14 February. The Act itself reads thus:
:"III. EXECUTIVE POWER
:Declaration of Executive Power in the Queen: ''section'' 9. The Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.

:Application of Provisions referring to Governor General:''section'' 10. The Provisions of this Act referring to the Governor General extend and apply to the Governor General for the Time being of Canada, or other the Chief Executive Officer or Administrator for the Time being carrying on the Government of Canada on behalf and in the Name of the Queen, by whatever Title he is designated." (''caps as copy-pasted from source'')[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/CONST_E.pdf]

At a guess, what the edit means to convey to the reader would be better said thus:
:Under section 9 of the Constitution Act, the executive government and authority for the whole of Canada has always been held by the Crown, thus linking the various governments into a federal state..."

===What "two associated but separate matters"?===
Mies: Your above comments and your latest undo[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=647579549&oldid=647523547] still fail to make clear what in your view are the "two associated but separate matters", which, to my mind, are certainly not coming across clearly as you have now left it. I have been at some pains to remove some of the obscurities that were in the article as I found it. Over a period of time, such obscurities occur fairly frequently in this sort of article with multiple editors, more or less skilled or knowledgeble, sometimes relying on inadequate or conflicting sources; and describing the workings of the so-called Westminster model of constitutional monarchy and parliamentary government is not all that simple in general or in its particular development in any given realm. Please explain, but as before said, be not overhasty; try and see it not from the way your mind is working but how a reasonably well-informed reader of the article might be led to understand it. First of all, are you proposing that the federal Canadian monarchy is ''not'' one in which the Crown has '''always''' "been unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country...", that is from the origin of the constitution  uniting federally the then several parts all the way continuously to the present? Secondly, if the Crown has always been unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country, what is the "other but separate matter" which you are seeking to establish by the way you have left the text of the article? [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 18:36, 17 February 2015 (UTC)
:The Crown is today unitary over and in all jurisdictions. S.9 makes no mention of that fact. S.9 also says nothing about the Crown having been unitary in and over all jurisdictions prior to 1 July 1867 (the possibility of such before any federation existed being another matter). S.9 speaks only of executive authority and it continuing to be vested in the monarch. Executive authority continuing to be vested in the monarch ≠ one crown in all 11 jurisdictions of the Canadian federation. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 19:05, 17 February 2015 (UTC)

::By your reply, I must take it that you are not proposing otherwise than that ''the federal Canadian monarchy is one in which the Crown has always "been unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country"'', that is from the 1867 origin of the constitution which first united federally under the Crown the then several parts all the way continuously to the present day. I see nothing in the article stating some later event from which the Crown has become unitary. Given the content of the rest of the section, and that there is nothing in the lead or the rest of the article which is to the effect that the Canadian monarchy has not always been a federal one in which Crown has been unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country, or that it became unitary at some later time, and given that the Canadian monarchy and Crown are co-aeval, there is no reason left to oppose: "The Canadian monarchy has always been a [[Federal monarchy|federal one]] in which the Crown is unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the country...".  [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 00:33, 18 February 2015 (UTC)
:::"The Canadian monarchy has always been a federal one in which the Crown is unitary..." gives the impression there was a federal monarchy of Canada before 1867, which there wasn't. Your wording would have to be "The Canadian monarchy has since 1867 been a federal one in which the Crown is unitary..." But, that could be read as saying there was a Canadian monarchy before 1867 that wasn't a federal one, which there wasn't; there was a monarchy in each of the British colonies in the Canadas. Given the article states "The monarchy of Canada is the core of both Canada's federalism... being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal and each provincial government", it seems fairly obvious the single Crown that unifies the federation has been around as long as the federation and vice-versa; one could not exist without the other. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 01:42, 18 February 2015 (UTC)

:::::The historical roots of the Canadian monarchy date back to approximately the turn of the 16th century, when European kingdoms made the first claims to what is now Canadian territory.

::::As I understand it, while acknowledging that the Canadian Crown emerged as 'an independent entity from that of the British Crown due to the Statute of Westminster 1931', as stated in the linked article [[List of Canadian monarchs]], there is no doubt that the Canadian monarchy and Crown date from the 1867 act.

The lede doesn't make any references to when "shifts" in the monarchy happened (French > British, British > Canadian, in disparate colonies > federated), which is fine for a summarising lede. The detail happens in the article body (which is what we seem to be wrestling with here). That said, the "unitary monarchy of today's federal" part is clunky and repetitious. It should be "eventually the legally distinct, federal Canadian monarchy"; possibly "legally distinct, federal Canadian monarchy of today".
:::::If it's clear the Canadian monarchy dates from 1867, why the need to add "one in which the Crown has always been" to the "Federal and provincial aspects" section? If you think there's some chance a reader might think the federal structure of the present monarch emerged after 1867, then what's needed to clarify is "Since Confederation, the Canadian monarchy has been one in which the Crown is..."

== Canada (and its monarchy) existed prior to Confederation ==

The date of 1867 is problematic, as we know that Canada existed prior to Confederation with the Colony of Canada (France), Colony of Canada (GB), Upper/Lower Canada, Province of Canada, and then finally the Dominion of Canada. Furthermore, the first Canadian Constitution Act was passed with the [[Constitutional Act 1791]]. Official sources state that "The Crown in Canada was first established by the kings of France and England in the 15th and 16th centuries" (1400s and 1500s with Henry VII listed as first) [http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1396027502283 Government of Canada]. The Canadian Encyclopedia lists Henry VII as first [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sovereign/]. The Canadian Royal Heritage Trust states that "There have been thirty-three monarchs of Canada, from nine royal houses, since 1497", and that "''The Canadian Monarchy therefore did not begin in 1867''" [http://crht.ca/the-sovereigns-of-canada/]. Finally, there are several sources stating that there have been 33 sovereigns of Canada since 1497 (sources available at the [[List of Canadian monarchs|sovereigns of Canada wiki page]]), a fact which clearly does not jive with the 1867 start of the monarchy date with Queen Victoria listed as the first sovereign to reign over Canada. I propose that the date be changed to 1497 and the first sovereign be changed to Henry VII, in line with the sources. A note can always be added to provide any needed clarification or explain any potential incongruities. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 05:57, 9 February 2015 (UTC)

1867, should be the starting mark for this article ''and'' the 'List of Canadian monarchs' article. Up until Confederation, Canada was a number of ''British'' colonies & before that ''French'' colonies. As a result, before 1867, they were ''French'' monarchs & ''British'' monarchs.

::Mies and Qex, I see now what you mean regarding the difference between the two article in terms of "what is now modern day Canada". However, one point, which I think TFD sort of brings up, is that Confederation was ''not'' the creation of a new country, since Canada does not really have a "founding" date. If we wish to discuss the modern purely Canadian monarchy, then perhaps 1931 should be selected as the date?
::Another reason why I find the 1867 date to be a bit arbitrary, is that the Constitution Act of 1867, [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-1.html section 9], states "''The Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to '''continue''' and be vested in the Queen''". Meaning that the executive and authoritive role of the monarchy within the British colony known as the Dominion of Canada was to ''continue'' in 1867. They did not create a new, Canadian monarchy in 1867, merely continued with the current monarchy and current sovereign. Which is another reason why I think we should either use the 1497 date, or the 1931 one. An argument could actually be used for 1952 as the date, since that was the first time the sovereign was actually crowned specifically as a Canadian sovereign, although I think the first usage of the term "King/Queen of Canada" dates to before 1867, and I've seen it written down in letters from 1901.

::To sum up, arguments can be made for at least 5 different dates. However, the overwhelming amount of official, academic, and other sources use the 1497 date, and either say or list out 33 different sovereigns, with the Constitution Act 1867 saying that the role of the monarch was simply to continue.

:The federal Crown was not "created" in 1867.  Instead the crowns of three provinces were merged and continued in the Crown of the Dominion of Canada.  The merged Crown assumed the rights and responsibilities of the provincial crowns, just as happened when the crowns of Scotland and England merged.  It is unlike Australia and the U.S. where a new government was created that had no precedent, did not automatically assume any rights or obligations, and was truly new.  If one claims the Canadian crown was created in 1867, kindly provide a source.
:Incidentally, if we follow Miesianiacal's opinion that the Crown of Canada became separate from the UK crown in 1931 then no crown could have been created in 1867.  However, while the English Court of Appeal disagreed in 1982 on when the Crown became divided, the issue was settled by the House of Lords in 2005.
:"[I]t is perfectly clear that the question whether the situs of rights and obligations of the Crown is to be found in right or respect of the United Kingdom, or of other governments within those parts of the Commonwealth of which Her Majesty is the ultimate sovereign, has nothing whatever to do with the question whether those governments are wholly independent or not. The situs of such rights and obligations rests with the overseas governments within the realm of the Crown, and not with the Crown in right or respect of the United Kingdom, even though the powers of such governments fall a very long way below the level of independence. Indeed, independence, or the degree of independence, is wholly irrelevant to the issue, because it is clear that rights and obligations of the Crown will arise exclusively in right or respect of any government outside the bounds of the United Kingdom as soon as it can be seen that there is an established government of the Crown in the overseas territory in question. In relation to Canada this had clearly happened by 1867."

===1867 and after===
Some of the information above may have gone astray from having regard to the need for this, and any other article connected with the topic, to be consistent with the 1867 act, cited in the article. 

The act was ''for the Union of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and the Government thereof; and for Purposes connected therewith'', and which was expressed to be for enabling
*the three provinces ''to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom'', and
*on the Establishment of the Union, for
:::''the Constitution of the Legislative Authority in the Dominion be provided for, and 
:::''the Nature of the Executive Government therein'' to be declared.
*and provision ''for the eventual admission into the Union of other parts of British North America'';
and that the act 
*enabled Queen Victoria to declare by proclamation the three provinces to ''form and be One Dominion under the Name of Canada'' such that the three provinces ''shall form and be One Dominion under that Name'', and 
*prescribed the division of this newly constituted federal union of Canada into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, etc.
By section 9 ''The Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada'' was ''declared to continue and be vested in the Queen''.  Under sections 17 and 19 there was to be one Parliament for the newly constituted Union, that was to be '' called together not later than Six Months after the Union''.
Section 91 provided for the enactment of legislation for the newly constituted union of Canada to be by ''the Queen, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate and House of Commons''. The act provided for the Governor General '' in the Queen’s Name'' to summon senators and to ''call together the House of Commons''.

Editors will also be aware that after 1867, British Columbia, originally politically constituted as a pair of British colonies, joined  the "[[Canadian Confederation]]" on July 20, 1871, per ([[History of British Columbia]]). 

On the face of it, and whatever secondary sources may choose to comment, it looks as though the words of the act were carefully drafted, can be taken to mean what they say, and have been duly executed by those responsible.

:"federally united" is curious phrasing, because that is not what happened, the Province of Canada for example was merged with the two other provinces.

==="...Canadian Royal Family is shared..."=== 
Another point of detail on this section: While the heading and main text may now be as they should be, the Note states ''The Canadian Royal Family is shared with other countries'' which seems unlikely. Yes, the realms have one and the same person for monarch, and members of the family participate in the public service of each of them, but would it be acceptable to state ''The Australian Royal Family is shared with Canada, the United Kingdom and some other countries''? Do Canadians have a particular position on this, or is the same position found in the other realms? The Note at the top states ''For information on the other countries which share the same person as monarch, see Commonwealth realm'', which seems more accurate.

:Since the article is about the "Monarchy of Canada" it is redundant to repeat Canadian in sections.

::Agree that we should express, if possible, the ''wilfulness'' on the part of the several realms, but not sure 'shared' does it better than 'have', since neither the monarchy nor the person of the monarch is 'shared' in any normally understood sense, such as sharing a racehorse or a yacht or a farm or a family business. Is the Governor General ''shared'' with the provinces? Do we ''normally'' speak/write of siblings sharing the same father/mother? They may share their own property, and inherit their parents' property in equal or unequal shares. But do we speak of persons who are members of a sports club ''sharing'' their membership? Citizens by birth of a country may ''have'' the same allegiance as naturalised citizens from another country, but when is it said, for example, that the Queen of Canada is shared with Australia, or the Queen of Australia is shared with Canada? Is this meant in the sense that countries which are members of the Commonwealth ''share'' Elizabeth as [[Head of the Commonwealth]]? That looks like SYN or OR. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] article informs readers that its member countries have ''shared values'', ''shared sporting and cultural heritage'', ''shared prosperity'', ''shared history of British presence'', ''shared constitutional histories'', and ''share many links outside government...''. It may be an inference that for those members that are realms, as part of their ''shared history of British presence'' or ''shared constitutional histories'', they have both a monarchical form of government and the same line of succession to their respective Crowns. But in any case, that has not come about as 'personal union' of the kind that is known of earlier European monarchies, by right of dynastic inheritance or marriage, or by treaty, such as King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg.

:::I'm not sure how you're confused about the fact 16 countries share one person as their respective monarch.

::::No confusion on my part. Noted that you have not responded to any of the points made, presumably because there is none, and none is produced by external internet search. The main point is, of course, about the way 'shared' is used in other contexts, showing that its use in the hatnote is not, as you proposed above, making more clear that the arrangement is voluntary on the part of Canada or the other realms. Why would 'have' be more likely than 'shared' to lead a Canadian reader, or one from any other realm or any other country, of the Commonwealth or not, to suppose continuation of a colonial status? Why is 'sharing' one and the same person as monarch while 'having' a distinct local Crown,  more wilful than 'having' the same person and a local Crown? In my view, the latter is both better English (in any of its varieties), less likely to be confused with other meanings, and better signifies independent sovereignty. Further, the former could induce a reader to associate the monarch of 16 realms with the political concept of power-sharing  of some kind, or to suppose that the monarch is able to share one government's confidences with any of the others.  In today's everyday parlance, share is perhaps most frequently used for disseminating by internet, and in the context of the article could be taken to signify that the governments or citizens of the realms are habitually 'sharing' news or opinions about their own monarch with the governments or citizens of the other realms that have the same person as monarch.

:::::::Thank you for responding with those links where 'share' has been used, but they can be seen to illustrate that encyclopedically 'share' is better avoided in the hatnote. I see the last link is dated 2010, and is ''A thesis submitted to Auckland University of Technology in fulfilment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)''. The abstract is internally inconsistent, in that having made a clear statement about the development of the independence of the several realms, such that the monarch is seen not to be shared, it then adopts the term 'share', in a way which we must surmise was regarded as academically acceptable, and perhaps encouraged, in the institution to which its author submitted it, which may show some lack of rigour in respect of the use of English in connection with a discipline which would not ordinarily be thought of as within the concept 'technology'. But this may be due to the expressed purpose of the thesis, to pioneer 'institutional theory to examine the ramifications of sharing a head of state'. Unfortunately, it is difficult to give the benefit of the doubt when seeing this error about the Crown: 'Upon close inspection, it appears that the differences between the Commonwealth Realms are not in their relationship with the broad structure (the crown) they share, but in many smaller details'. That fundamental misconception about the Crown, further elaborated as the thesis proceeds, may be explained by the author's approach indicated by: 'Perceptions of the shared structure clearly recreate that structure in a continuous feedback loop; a cycle of perception, modification, and operation. This feedback loop is probably the most significant ramification of sharing a head of state to be found within the shared structure as it exists at present. The loop has the capacity both to reinforce the structure's strengths, and to further its limitations...the shared structure, as it presently exists, is a complex and organic structure which is constantly evolving'. The work may, however, be seen as a valiant attempt to explain the unusual state of affairs connecting the one person with the several, independent, Crowns. Figure 1 is interesting, where B 'illustrates the common components of the inter-realm perspective', and is represented by an image of the crown which the Queen is accustomed to wear at a state opening of the UK Parliament: it is part of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] which are not in a literal sense regarded as 'shared' among the realms. But your comments again fail to make a reasoned case for retaining ''shared'', or claiming that there is 'consensus' for retaining it, while this page  shows support for removing it. Your comment falsely states that my reasoning makes stuff up. Nothing has been made up. Your suggestion that ' "shared" applies perfectly, by definition' is certainly 'made up' without basis in reason or otherwise, given that there are various uses of 'share' as mentioned in my above comments, which are unsuited to the 16 several monarchies whose separate independence and sovereignty are based on not sharing the one Crown, but each being considered as having its own Crown, while the one person, the present Queen, participates in each and every one of them.

{{od}} For all you write, I don't see a reasonable argument to use "have". (For goodness sake, the hatnote doesn't even include the word "crown", a shared one or otherwise; it says clearly it is one ''person'' who is shared, which is demonstrably true; see above and [[Commonwealth realm]]: "They are united only in voluntary sharing of... the Queen herself.")

:Yet another instance of a reply making a non-point while dodging the point in question: reasoned objection to the use of the word ''share'', having regard to nearer and farther instances exemplifying that it is not suited, encyclopedically, to the Queen, monarchy or Crown of the several realms.

:::Noted that you have nothing to add. Admittedly, (sources permitting) it could make better sense to use ''shared'' in respect of the states and the Commonwealth of Australia under their constitution[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Australia&diff=650925846&oldid=642862215], and possibly of the provinces and federal state of Canada under that country's constitution, comparable, some might suppose, with the provinces or bishoprics of the Roman Catholic Church sharing the Pope as supreme pontiff, and with the various parts of the Roman Empire under the emperors, before and after Byzantium became the seat of the imperial court. Given that some editors here have become habituated to such a use in respect of Australia and Canada, both of which countries are also members of the Commonwealth which comprises both realms and republics that share, as above mentioned, certain political and cultural traditions originating in the British Isles, and having Queen Elizabeth as the Head, it will be understandable, if misguided, that some editors may be reluctant to acknowledge that the concept of a ''shared'' monarch could be seen to derogate from the independent and sovereign status of the realms, while feeling it enhances a sense of solidarity and cultural loyalty as distinct from allegiance according to law.

== Arms ==

I do not think that it is suitable to have a user-based interpretation of the Arms of Canada depicted within this page's infobox passing itself off as the "Royal Arms of Canada". They are not the Royal Arms of Canada, they are a user-generated interpretation of the actual Arms. And if this rendition is "so nearly resembling as to be likely to be mistaken for" the original then it is a violation of Canadian law. Further, "permission is always required when the work is being revised, adapted, or translated regardless if the purpose of the reproduction is for personal or public non-commercial distribution". Simply put, either this image is so far off as to be useless, misleading and/or insulting, or if it 'so nearly resembles' the original then it is a violation. If a picture of the Royal Arms of Canada is 'vital to the understanding of the material being discussed in the article' then the ''actual'' Arms should be used. Otherwise, if it is not vital to the understanding of the topic at hand, a wiki-link to the Arms of Canada page (that shows the actual official Arms) is sufficient.

::Ideas are free to use, but that would mean that the user rendition in question is based ''only'' on the blazon and not at all on the official Arms (cannot "reproduce the work or any substantial <u>part</u> thereof in any material form"), however this is clearly not the case as a variety of elements in this rendition are taken directly from the official rendition which are in no way mentioned in the blazon (so the blazon is obviously not the primary source, the copyrighted image is). And if you look at cases such as [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWPCC/2012/1.html Temple Island] as well as Supreme Court of Canada cases, an image can be a wholly created original, but if it mimicks a copyrighted work, or elements therein, it is a copyright violation. 

::Back to the main point though, the blazon is not signed by the Queen, the armorial bearings depicting the actual painting of the arms themselves receive the signature approval of the Queen. The blazon is used to make renditions, but the actual rendition signed by the Queen is what constitutes the official Royal Arms of Canada. This applies to any Arms that depict the Royal Crown actually. So if you look at original armorial bearings showing the actual drawing of military arms and unit badges for example, they are all personally signed by the Queen. So, this user rendition is based on the blazon produced by the heralds yes, but it is ''not'' the approved, actual Royal Arms of Canada. To depict anyone's personal interpretation of these Arms as the actual Arms themselves is misleading (or insulting, or illegal).

:::{{ec}} Again, if it follows the blazon of the Canadian arms, it's the Canadian arms.

In the absence of a reliable source, it's merely expressing an opinion to say that only the version signed by the Queen (does it exist? Is there an available image of it?) is the Royal Arms of Canada. It's just ''a'' version of the Royal Arms of Canada. Like the one used in the infobox here is. Which brings me to another point: this isn't the article on the arms. I don't think we need to worry about the rendering in the infobox, so long as it follows the blazon accurately.

However, I still refer back to my point about it being perfectly legitimate to have different renderings of the arms--in stone, glass, paint, ink, whatever. I suspect Her Majesty would be surprised to hear the escutcheon of her Canadian arms depicted in the [[:File:Diamond Jubilee Window Ottawa.jpeg|Diamond Jubilee Window]] is not, in fact, the escutcheon of her Canadian arms. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''Ħ'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 02:18, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

:::::Mies, that rendition is not based on the blazon. The blazon makes no mention of the helm below the crest, not its colours, not the maple leaf at its gorge, to name just one element that is absent from the blazon. Yet, both this user rendition, and the official Arms depict the helm in the same way, in the same colours, down to the same maple leaf at the gorge. 

:::::The monarch did not sign off and approve just the blazon, the sovereign signs off on an actual official depiction. It is for this reason that all actual Arms of Canada depict the helm in nearly the same way even though it is not described anywhere in the blazon, because the actual Arms are based on the approved depiction, not just on the blazon. When the depiction is changed, such as when the annulus was added to the current Arms, its approved in an official way. It's in the same principle as File:Monarchist League of Canada (CoA).png, there is only one official and actual MLC COA, a random user interpretation of the blazon should not be passed off as ''the'' MLC COA in an encyclopedic entry. Except in the case of the Arms of Canada it is much more officialised and legally controlled.

:::::I think I did a poor job of defining my issue. Those three pictures you posted of architectural embellishments do not purport to pass themselves off as ''the'' Royal Arms of Canada in an encyclopedia. That is the issue here. If we label this image in the info box as a "User Interpretation of the Royal Arms of Canada", I wouldn't have a problem. Or if we just use the actual Royal Arms of Canada and leave the label the same, or alternatively just get rid of both altogether as they are not vital to the article anyways. A fourth option could be to remove the image from the infobox and put it in the body of the article with a "An interpretation of the Royal Arms..." description. Any one of those four options I'm happy with. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 02:27, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

:::::Also, in terms of the shift from the 1957 official depiction, to the present one, ''even though based on the same blazon'', "The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority, and <u>was approved by H.M. the Queen</u>, on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, on July 12, 1994."[http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/coatArmsCanada.htm] The blazon remains essentially unchanged, and has been so for nearly 100 years, however every time the design (depiction) is changed, its personally approved by the Queen.

::::::Er, the blazon does mention the helm: "a royal helmet". And, while the blazon may not dictate the colour of the helm or the presence of the maple leaf on it, what you call the "actual official" version still shows a colour to the helmet and a maple leaf at the gorge, though, in a manner different to the arms in the infobox here. So, I don't see the relevance. Also, there's two images in the [[Arms of Canada#Use|"Use" section]] of [[Arms of Canada]] showing different renderings of the arms and calling them, in the relevant captions, the "arms of Canada".
::::::The image used here has on its Wikimedia page a standard template that says "This heraldic coat of arms was drawn based on its written description called the blazon. Any illustration conforming with the insignia's written blazon is considered to be heraldically correct. In other words, there can exist several different artistic interpretations of the same coat of arms." Clearly, then, Wikimedia allows variations on arms and considers them correct so long as they follow the blazon. There's still been no evidence that the rendition used here doesn't conform to the blazon. So long as the image is kept at Wikimedia with that template, I see no reason why it can't be used in Wikipedia. If it's deleted from Wikimedia or loses that template (by consensus), then...

::Mies, where do you see "Royal helmet" [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=461&ProjectElementID=1555 in the blazon]? There is not a single use of the word "helm" or "helmet" in the blazon listed on the site. If you are referring to the paper copy of the registration, then the term "royal helmet" could mean an infinite number of things, the fact that both renditions use the same style of helmet, with the some details, and with the same colours is proof that the blazon is not the source of this work, but the official design of the arms themselves (and in the British and Canadian legal systems is concretely a copyright violation).
::Second, the blazon is not the official design of the Royal Arms of Canada. The design (depiction) is what was approved in 1994 by the Queen via Letters Patent. The question of whether or not the user-rendition meets the textual description in the blazon is a strawman argument, the blazon ''is not'' the design. So yes, a random user design may be "heraldically correct", but that does not mean that that design can be used interchangeably with the real/official/actual/approved design. 
::As Moxy states, [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=462&ProjectImageID=1152 the heralic blazon of the Canadian Flag] is not what makes the flag design "real" or not, it is the design included on the Letters Patent that were approved by the Queen that is the "real" Canadian flag. The blazon for the flag only states "Gules on a Canadian pale Argent a maple leaf Gules". That does not mean that I can throw together a bright red, rounded, unstylised maple leaf, with two dark red bars on a silver background, and pass it off in an encyclopedia and pass it off as ''the'' Canadian Flag simply because it meets the textual description. If I saw a random 'messed up' design of the Canadian Flag drawn by John Smith in an Encyclopedia, I would quite rightly be both insulted and dismiss the validity of anything else that encyclopedia tried to pass off as "knowledge".

*This is such a non-issue. There are multiple user created CoA's on WP. The whole point of heraldry is that any representation of the arms is "correct" provided it is in conformity with the blazon. That the Canadian government also has "officially" recognised a particular image of it is relevant but does not affect the validity of other representations, provided they conform with the blazon. Nothing I have read here indicates to me that this image does not conform with the blazon. If Moxy and trackratte want to add a note to the image that this is not the version used by the government of Canada, then I don't have a problem with that, but it's unnecessary. The government's version has a special position undoubtedly but, per normal heraldic rules, it does not have any exclusive claim to validity.

:::::Map data and The Queen of Canada's Coat of Arms are apples and oranges. The Queen signed a ''very specific image'' which made it a legal Coat of Arms of State. Passing off a user-generated work as ''the'' Arms of Canada is simply false, thus my use of the word fake. Are they in accordance with the blazon? Most likely, but that is irrelevant to the conversation entirely. Being in accordance with the blazon does not make them the Royal Arms of Canada (which are a legally designated design signed and approved personally by the Queen of Canada as Her Arms), it simply makes them an interpretive design. Are they similar enough to likely be mistaken for the Arms by a lay-person? Yes they are, which is precisely my point, they are passing themselves off to be something they are not.

*''This is such a non-issue''. Agreed. To my mind (not Canadian), the erroneous reasoning in "trackratte's" opening comment was sufficiently rebutted above, and Mies.'s proposal to add  "A rendition of the Royal Arms of Canada" or something to that effect is agreeable to reason, and would be acceptable. If truly out-of-date, date it as at and before 1957(?) if that can be indubitably sourced.  Or DeCausa's 'add note to the image that this is not the version used by the government of Canada'. Can't see how insults come into it. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 14:13, 19 February 2015 (UTC)

::Qex, you're missing the point entirely. Whether or not the Arms are "official" or if they are the version used by the Government of Canada is entirely irrelevant. The Queen only has one coat of arms design, the one that she approved and signed, which is of legal significance. The 1957 and 1994 designs were both personally approved by the Queen of Canada (legally speaking, the state), with the 1994 version superseding the 1957 version. 
::The issue here is not whether or not this rendition of the arms should be used in Wikipedia ''ever'', it is purely about this rendition being used in an infobox as the "Royal Arms of Canada".

:::::Conflict edit, I guess Mies beat me to it. I tried modifying the caption in the infobox to some shockingly bad results, ha. My issue with the infoxbox is 1. My understanding that we can't edit the caption, and 2. By virtue of being in the infobox and the first thing the reader sees, it adds a certain air of "officialdom". Don't get me wrong, I'm not vehemently opposed to the image itself. In light of the (overly?) restrictive policy on the Coat of Arms of Canada's use on Wikipedia, I think this image certainly can have its uses. My only issue is that, if used, it should be used in an open and honest manner, namely these are not the Arms of Her Majesty the Queen, but an interpretation based on the blazon. If we are able to resolve the technical issues of the template and place an appropriate caption, something like "A user-created interpretation of the Royal Arms of Canada" or something to that effect, I would be perfectly content.

::::::So, the problem from the editing pov is a technical hitch. Yes, I had missed that point, but I am one of those that see the concern about the image being given an air of  "officialdom" as more imagined than real (for reasons given by others). It ain't broke, it don't need fixing, even if we could. The caption "Royal Arms of Canada" is not a misrepresentation. The image conforms with the heraldic description given in full at its File page[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Canada_rendition.svg], (which also displays versions for 1921-1957 and 1957-1994), and, as I undertstand it, as officially registered (March 2005).[http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=461&ProjectImageID=1207]There is no need to dispute the excellence of the artwork.

Except that the heraldic description and the design are two separate things. It doesn't matter 'if it fits the heraldic description', it doesn't make them the Arms of Her Majesty the Queen. If I make a flag of Canada 'that fits the heraldic description', it does not make it the legal flag of Canada, it makes it an 'heraldically correct interpretation'. No one is even talking about the 'heraldic correctness' of the image, so I fail to see why it keeps on getting brought up. There is only one legal flag of Canada, and only one Coat of Arms of the Queen of Canada. I do not see why this image ''must'' be passed off as the Arms of Canada when all that is required is the addition of a single word to the caption within the infobox, or simply moving the image into the body of the text.

This page has it in an official looking infobox with the label "Royal Arms of Canada", which it is not. Once again, the Royal Arms of Canada is a very specific and legal design. Let's call this legal design Arms X. You can have a million renditions that are all 'heraldically correct', Arms N1-Arms NN, however Arms N are not Arms X.

===No conflict of "Arms"===
The use in the caption of the words 'The Royal Arms of Canada' does not conflict with anything in the article, nor with any law or custom. In connection with the question discussed above (on whether to discontinue using in the infobox an image depicting the Royal Arms which is not the same as that at the linked article [[Arms of Canada]]), it may be noted that 'Arms' appears twice in the article: first, in the infobox caption, and secondly in the sentence ''An image of the Queen and/or the Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada is always displayed in Canadian federal courtrooms...''. Both of those link to [[Arms of Canada]] where the infobox depicts the same blazon but ascribed on its file page to another artist: '...drawn by Mrs. Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority, office of the Governor General of Canada, and faithfully depicts the arms described in the words of the Royal Proclamation dated November 21, 1921. The present design was approved in 1994.' Given that the article does not state or imply that a copy of that image is what is invariably 'displayed in Canadian federal courtrooms' (nor that the image of the Queen is invariably a copy of one which is, perhaps, officially authorised) there is no good reason to see the infobox caption as in conflict with the text. It may be worth noting for comparison the practice in English parish churches, in which can be seen displayed, usually on a wooden panel, a painted representation of the arms of the monarch reigning at the time the painting was done. Seldom, if ever, are these identical in the sense of being an exact copy of a single authorised original. It has never been doubted that each of these likenesses are properly called 'Royal Arms': no other words would be as apt in ordinary speech or writing.

A websearch for images of 'Royal Arms of Canada' produced this[http://blog.appletonstudios.com/2014/06/canadas-royal-arms.html] (with a link to [[Canadian Heritage]][http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/coatArmsCanada.htm]) and an image identical to the one at [[Arms of Canada]],[http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1359469552514/1359469845405] commenting that a rendition made by Alan Beddoe, the Founder of the Heraldry Society of Canada, became very familiar to Canadians as the version used by the Government of Canada until the mid-1990s. 'This version also changed the design of the Royal Crown from the "Tudor Crown" depiction used for the previous half-century to one with depressed arches that more closely resembles the actual St. Edward's Crown. Upon her accession, the present Queen indicated her preference for the latter depiction.  The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority, and was approved by H.M. the Queen, on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, on July 12, 1994. It includes a new element: an annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the Order of Canada, Desiderantes Meliorem Patriam ("They desire a better country"). ''This excellent yet minor addition provoked a great deal of debate (excerpts from Hansard Debates can be found here[http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/hansard.htm]), which demonstrated a thorough misunderstanding of heraldry by our parliamentarians.'' (emphasis added) This version has gradually replaced the Beddoe rendition as the one used by the federal government. The use of these arms by the government is determined by the Treasury Board Secretariat through its Federal Identity Program. Generally speaking, the arms of Canada are used by Cabinet ministers, Members of Parliament and Senators, and the federal judiciary.' That image is heraldically indistinguishable from the one in question here, and the latter is in no way a defacement: it is an excellent example of what heraldry promotes, which is to enable unmistakeable recognition, as might be in a book of symbols used for a military purpose. That is not surprising, given that a coat of arms is for battlefield recognition, and a blazon is a decorative embellishment, controlled by officially appointed [[herald]]s, from the days of [[chivalry]].

My '''proposal''' for such a note is:
:The version currently in use by the government is shown at [[Arms of Canada]]. For online explanation see [[Royal Heraldry Society of Canada]] website.[http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/coatArmsCanada.htm]

:::: Qex, "The coat of arms of the Queen in Right of Canada is also the official coat of arms of Canada" is a fundamental understanding of Canada's constitutional system. The Queen ''is'' Canada, so the sovereigns Arms are not ''also'' the arms of Canada, they are one and the same. And the issue has nothing to do with which depiction the Government of Canada uses, they can use whatever depiction they want. The issue is which design was legally signed off as approved by the Sovereign. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 17:43, 22 February 2015 (UTC)

:::::''is also'' there = 'is identical with', 'also serves as', and other variations. But it is natural to put the monarch first, because it is only in consequence that the arms at the same time, but not in the same way, are granted/ given/ treated and accepted/ taken and regarded as that of Canada. But the notion that the "Queen is Canada" is pov, eccentric and not commonly accepted in ordinary usage or among those with sufficient expertise in the subject to be reliable guides. It seems that your comment surmises that one particular artist's depiction will be the one and only because it has been (supposedly) 'signed off as approved by the Sovereign', but, if that is not simply a misunderstanding of the use of the English language in this connection, it is a misunderstanding of the actuality. An official in a government department may be required to use that depiction and no other, a government department or the Governor General could urge senators and others to adopt it and not use any other depiction, but that is not binding on them or on others who are Canadian citizens and as such subjects of the Queen in right of Canada. Shall we let this go now? To my mind, it is ceasing to have whatever relevance it may have had to improving the article. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 20:12, 23 February 2015 (UTC)

::::::Qex, when I say "signed off" by the Sovereign, I mean exactly that. Every time the Royal Crown is depicted on a new set of Arms, the Queen physically signs it. It says "Approved." and then below is signed. I have seen originals exactly like this on three different occasions, it's just how it's done. So no, it's not "supposedly". As for government departments and civilians, that's all irrelevant. There is only one design used by the Queen of Canada at any given time. Since the Queen is the "human embodiment of the state/Crown" (Government of Canada), and "Because the Queen is the State" [https://books.google.ca/books?id=j4PuSbhsxeoC&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=the+queen+is+the+human+embodiment+of+the+state&source=bl&ots=5BThulQW59&sig=WH1Ztcoc7jN3n0chFnDvfDjYA-0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TCXtVKO2CvCIsQSjxoGgDw&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=the%20queen%20is%20the%20human%20embodiment%20of%20the%20state&f=false], the state legally only has one design at any given time. Interpretations can be used by anyone, governments, civilians, organisations, etc but there are exactly that, only interpretations (being heraldically correct or not is irrelevant). And the same rules and protections apply to any design that resemble the actual legal design. 
::::::As for improving the article, we are saying that this article does not require a depiction of the Coat of Arms. There is no clear and present reason to keep it. On top of that, it does not depict the state/crown/sovereigns one and only actual legal design. So, why are we showing an interpretation when we could be showing the real thing? If we can't show the real thing, then nothing should be shown at all. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 01:54, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

:::::::First, my comment above was based on my surmise (which your comment confirms) about your experience of seeing the Queen's own sign manual, but if there is anything online to support what you describe it has not so far been produced, nor have I myself been able to trace it.

That, too, is confirmed by your comment. I now see from your comment that the purport of your reasoning is solely to contend that ''this article does not require a depiction of the Coat of Arms''. Knowing that to be so, if I read again the paragraph by which you opened this section, I can see it there, but obscured from my understanding by the camouflage of flawed reasoning in which it is enwrapped.

==="Arms" in the lead===
This addition to the lead:
:"[[Arms of Canada|The coat of arms of the Queen in Right of Canada]] is also the official coat of arms of Canada.''footnote'' The version currently in use by the government is shown at [[Arms of Canada]]."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=648206592&oldid=648206367] 
has been removed. The reasons for removal given above are:
*that's just a random factoid inserted into the lede; 
*it's specific to the arms, for which this is not the article; 
*the summary doesn't summarise anything in particular in this article;
*the note only links to an article already linked in the text the note follows.
*There's no way to address Moxy's and trackratte's concerns about the arms in the infobox by editing the lede. 
My first point is that the arms should be mentioned in the lead, whatever the infobox contains as now or as may be altered, unless (and until) the proposed alteration actually duplicates.

Secondly, given that [[Factoid]] is "an item of unreliable information that is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact...can also be used to describe a particularly insignificant or novel fact, in the absence of much relevant context", we may remark that, as is the way with items in the lead, the context is in the body: "An image of the Queen and/or the Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada is always displayed in Canadian federal courtrooms..."; and that the arms are sufficiently ''relevant'' to the topic of this article, 'Monarchy of Canada', to be used for the infobox, and sufficiently ''signficant'' to have been under much discussion here (as yet not concluded), and to have been discussed in parliament[http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/hansard.htm], and to be promoted as government policy: 'This version has gradually replaced the Beddoe rendition as the one used by the federal government. The use of these arms by the government is determined by the Treasury Board Secretariat through its Federal Identity Program. Generally speaking, the arms of Canada are used by Cabinet ministers, Members of Parliament and Senators, and the federal judiciary.'[http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/coatArmsCanada.htm], meaning that the royal arms are not merely an attribute of the monarch of Canada, but are used for the purpose described in the opening sentence of the article : 'The monarchy of Canada is the core of both Canada's federalism and its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy, being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal and each provincial government', which is expanded in the section headed 'Federal and provincial aspects'.

If duplicating the link is a problem, one or other link can be unlinked.

== Waning support for monarchy ==

According to this [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/royal-family-support-by-Canadians-waning-poll-indicates-1.3072469 CBC news source], support in Canada for its monarchy is dropping. Recommend this be added to the article. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 20:31, 18 May 2015 (UTC)
:The article doesn't support that statement. It says that in 2015, "Just fewer than four in 10 favour abolishing monarchy in Canada upon the death of the Queen", whereas in 2013, "The results in some ways mirror numbers from a poll taken in 2013 ... Thirty-seven per cent of Canadians polled were armchair monarchy abolitionists back then ... These measures appear to be static across two years". So, 37% in 2013, and 'just under 4 in 10' in 2015, so the numbers 'appear to be static'.
:Secondly, the president of the research firm that ran the poll stated that "It is clear there are a substantial number of people who, while they support the monarchy in Canada, don't necessarily support the heir apparent". It seems like editorial staff trying to drive up viewer clicks with sensationalist headlines to me. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 20:57, 18 May 2015 (UTC)

== Divisible monarchy ==

The article states as a fact that "Although the person of the sovereign is equally shared with fifteen other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct". That is a debated and contentious argument, and certainly should not be recorded as a fact. There are practical and legal reasons for arguing against the idea of a separate monarchy, not the least of which is that British laws pertaining to the Crown have effect on the "Queen of Canada".[[User:Royalcourtier|Royalcourtier]] ([[User talk:Royalcourtier|talk]]) 00:43, 4 April 2015 (UTC)

:There are numerous sources supporting the fact, and refs within the lede are generally avoided, particularly if they are explained and/or substantiated further on in the body of the article. For example, see note 4 within the article: "The English Court of Appeal ruled in 1982, while 'there is only one person who is the Sovereign within the British Commonwealth ... in matters of law and government the Queen of the United Kingdom, for example, is entirely independent and distinct from the Queen of Canada.'[32]". While there may be arguments against the idea of a separate monarchy, the way it is worded within the article is based on legal and political realities within both Canada and the United Kingdom. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 02:14, 4 April 2015 (UTC)

::You would need a source that makes that argument.  Certainly the accepted law today is that the Crown is distinct not only in each independent nation, but in territories and subnational units as well.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 13:55, 4 April 2015 (UTC)

:::The theory that the "country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct" is not legally correct. The idea of separate sovereignties is contentious, and legally unsound.

::::Do you have any (modern) sources that question this?  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 14:22, 19 May 2015 (UTC)

:There are no legal authority of which I am aware that suggests that "each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct". It is for those asserting that strange proposition to prove it.  The Statute of Westminster envisaged a single Crown. Of course the Queen in right of Canada is legally distinct from the Queen in right of New Zealand. Just as the Queen in right of Alberta is legally distinct from the Queen in right of Nova Scotia. That is not the same as the monarchy of Nova Scotia being separate and legally distinct from that of Alberta.[[User:Royalcourtier|Royalcourtier]] ([[User talk:Royalcourtier|talk]]) 01:22, 25 May 2015 (UTC)

In addition to those remarks by May LJ, [[Michael Kerr (lawyer)|Kerr LJ]] observed[67]: "It is settled law that, although Her Majesty is the personal sovereign of the peoples inhabiting many of the territories within the Commonwealth, all rights and obligations of the Crown - other than those concerning the Queen in her personal capacity - can only arise in relation to a particular government within those territories. The reason is that such rights and obligations can only be exercised and enforced, if at all, through some governmental emanation or representation of the Crown." It is to be noted that these conclusions were expressed in the United Kingdom even before the enactment by its Parliament of the Canada Act 1982 (UK) and the Australia Act 1986 (UK) ("the 1986 UK Act").

== Full agnatic or Male preference ==

This article is confusing me. Is the succession to the Canadian throne ''full agnatic'' or ''male preference''? It's my understanding that it's the latter, unless & until the SCOC says otherwise. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 19:56, 26 May 2015 (UTC)
:The law in Canada, binding the government and the Crown, is as enacted by parliament, unless a court of competent jurisdiction eventually rules otherwise. At present, the line is the same down to 27th. Thus there is little prospect of the heir apparent being any different in the near future. A difference would occur if a third Cambridge child is born and he is a prince, but not if she is a princess. It may be surmised that by the time Prince George is heir apparent, the supposed problem under the law of Canada will be resolved.

== Too much obsolete/obsolescent information ==

The subsection 1.1 headed 'Succession and regency' would be improved by removing from the end of its first paragraph the clause with the piped reference to ''O'Donohue v Canada'', and removing the second paragraph, which may have been suited to the article before the passing of the 2013 act, but is now obsolete. The present question, so far as concerns this article's topic, is whether a judicial ruling will be obtained to the effect that male-preference primogeniture persists in Canada, instead of the absolute primogeniture which is now the law in the UK and other realms. The second paragraph of 1.1 mentions ''the constitution of Canada'' and the third mentions ''Canada's constitution'' and the  Constitution Act, 1982.  A link to [[Constitution of Canada]] comes later, in the first sentence of the "Federal constitutional role", but It appears that the legal proceedings on the point of principle concerning amending the constitution has not been considered notable enough for mention there. 
*At the end of the first paragraph of 1.1: ''legislation limits the succession to the non-adopted, legitimate descendants of Sophia of Hanover and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic, nor married to one, and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne; these particular clauses have prompted legal challenge'' linking to  O'Donohue v Canada, a case in the courts of Ontario. The linked article concludes by quoting the court's judgment, delivered in 2003,  upheld on appeal in 2005:  ''the lis raised in the present application is not justiciable and there is no serious issue to be tried. Public interest standing should not be granted. Given my ruling on these issues I need not deal with the other considerations that apply to the granting of public interest standing. The application is dismissed.'' In other words this "legal challenge" has next to no informative value relevant to the current legal proceedings in Quebec, whose outcome is likely to be of particular interest from the point of view of politicians and those actively concerned with interpreting and applying the Canadian constitution, but will not affect the line of succession, at least in respect of the four persons now next in line.
*The second paragraph discusses in some detail the effect of ''Canada's adoption of the Statute of Westminster 1931'', and  ends by saying '' if the UK were to breach the convention set out in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster and unilaterally change the line of succession to the British throne, the alteration would have no effect on the reigning sovereign of Canada or his or her heirs and successors'' citing what appears to be a review published in 1997 of a book published in 1995. Neither the book nor the review could make any comment on the act of 2013, or the likely outcome of the current judicial proceedings in Quebec, or the question whether the current line of succession is male preference or absolute primogeniture. In other words its informative value for reporting to readers what the present state of the succession is appears to be not more than nil.

Anyone interested in letting the article be further improved is advised not to be put off by the impetuosity of that remark. I believe a reasonably attentive editor willing to collaborate with others here for improving the article would have noticed that the main point is in the first sentence at the top of this section, which is followed by consecutive reasoning, and quotations to avoid the sort of misunderstanding that can arise even among attentive readers. In view of Mies.'s remark, I will point out that no one is obliged to engage in constructive discussion who finds that too difficult or too tedious, but dumping nonsense here instead is not welcomed. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 18:47, 21 November 2015 (UTC)

Since it seems likely changing one part of the section is going to have impact on another or other parts (as the above editor's change did), and so on, working out the wording for the section--or the first three paragraphs, at least--here appears to be the better option in terms of article stability. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 19:58, 21 November 2015 (UTC)

Given the discussions on this page, to my mind the earlier of these two versions is more suited to the article than the later: 00:33, 22 November (Miesianiacal) and 02:59, 22 November(GoodDay).[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&type=revision&diff=691778123&oldid=691762625] [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 07:46, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

::In disagreement with that version. Once the British act of succession was enacted, the Canadian succession (via it's own act) was also altered. To date, the Supreme Court of Canada hasn't declared this action unconstitutional. PS- With all due respect to Toffoli, he's not the SCOC.  [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 16:02, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

::I disagree with the change you've just restored, Qex. However, I don't wish to get into an edit-war with you & therefore, there's nothing I can do about it.

[[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 16:13, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

:::But the Canadian succession was altered by order in council not legislation.  The OC allowed the GG to order the changes.  Also, the order was made later than the date in which it came into effect.  Instead of saying what the rules were before, perhaps we should just state what they currently are, then mention what they once were.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 16:34, 22 November 2015 (UTC)
::::{{ec}} According to the government that tabled the Succession to the Throne Bill, royal succession for Canada was not altered "via its own act" or by an order-in-council. It was altered simply because the UK altered its succession. Whether you hold that the UK can alter its succession without the assent of Canada's parliament (because that requirement is only a convention) or that the UK can't alter its succession without the assent of Canada's parliament (because that would be contrary to the convention), it was the enforcement of the UK Succession to the Crown Act that changed succession in the UK and, by extension, according to the Harper Cabinet, changed succession in Canada, too.

Noting all the above comments, and arguing against none, I see the wording of the first sentence in the 16:39, 22 November version[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&type=revision&diff=691851235&oldid=691847637] as maybe odd at first sight, but, as we know, it is correctly in agreement with the Canadian act and compatible with the information which follows, including the Quebec judicial proceedings, and, to me at least, it looks the best so far. For reasons previously given, I remain doubtful about continuing to rely on the ''obiter dicta''  in ''O'Donohue's'' case, even as cited in ''Teskey's'' case of 2013. Both of these may be superseded as a result of the ongoing Quebec proceedings, which may be appealed to the federal court,  but meantime, given the state of the legislation and political sensitivities all round in constitutional cases such as this, editors here will be aware that the legal reasoning either way is awkward, even for responsible experts  acting in their professional capacity such as top government lawyers and judges, and editors here should take care not to write the article as if Wikipedia knows the ultimate answer, or that those two cases can be treated as having in any way resolved the issue currently before the Quebec court. We (not excluding loyal Canadians of monarchist or republican inclination) may also note that those proceedings must be treated as having enough justiciability to be entertained by the court, and for the federal government to be a party, whether or not any of us believe we have reason to expect the court to uphold the act's validity to the effect that the law of succession has been changed from male-preference to absolute primogeniture for persons born after a certain date. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 18:29, 22 November 2015 (UTC)
:I respectfully disagree with the 16:39 Novmeber 22, 2015 edit. If the Canadian royal succession is still ''male preference'' (and marriage to Catholics is still barred, along with the monarch can still bar any marriages in the royal family), then I ask ''again'' - What exactly is being challenged in the Quebec superior court? If those 2 Laval University professors in the Quebec courts are arguing against a change in the succession & how it came about? then the change in succession must have already occured.

::As we kow, the main issue is constitutional validity of the act, and whether it has been and will remain of no legal effect. The purpose of the act, which is outlined in the article, is secondary. If there is a source to say that the law was effective to change the succession but may cease to be as from the date of a judicial declaration but not before, please let us have a citation, perhaps from a precedent where a judicial ruling has been given in the highest federal court declaring a federal act unonstitutional and of no effect from the date it was passed. Whatever private opinion anyone may have, here, or in the whole of Canada, or in any Commonwealth realm, or elsewhere, really nothing but a clear precedent in the Canadian court will suffice. Whatever the opinions of the private parties, the Quebec and federal governments are also parties, and it could be interesting to see the arguments they have presented to the court, but more intereating to see the judgment when it is delivered.

It may help GoodDay if I confirm that my present position is unchanged from 22:15, 26 May 2015(UTC), linked by Mies. at "Succession" above. "The law in Canada, binding the government and the Crown, is as enacted by parliament, unless a court of competent jurisdiction eventually rules otherwise. At present, the line is the same down to 27th. Thus there is little prospect of the heir apparent being any different in the near future. A difference would occur if a third Cambridge child is born and he is a prince, but not if she is a princess. It may be surmised that by the time Prince George is heir apparent, the supposed problem under the law of Canada will be resolved."

However, the court's decision could be wrong and a future court could re-impose the law as if it had been in force since it was ordered by the governor general.  The same is true of all laws.  So there can never be absolute certainty what the law is.  The issue is whether the challenge is of sufficient strength for us to question where a proclaimed law is valid.

== ..."the rules for succession are not fixed"... ==

I see  nothing in any cited source in the present version for the words  ''As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment'', in the section "Succession and regency". The wording stems from May 2007[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=next&oldid=133795393] ([[User:G2bambino]]), and even if well-sourced is argumentative rather than factual. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 17:34, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
:There's already a number of sources stating the laws of succession are part of the constitution. More specifically,
:* Justice Rouleau of the Ontario Superior Court did say "Unilateral changes by Canada to the rules of succession, whether imposed by the court or otherwise, would... for all intents and purposes, bring about a fundamental change in the office of the Queen without securing the authorizations required pursuant to s. 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982."[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html] That pretty well defines a change to succession as a constitutional amendment.
:* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com:80/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html Here], Philippe Lagassé says "A change to the rules of succession necessarily amends the Constitution."
:* [[Anne Twomey]] cites Rouleau's statement that the Act of Settlement is part of Canada's constitution and goes on to say "Underlying these interconnected provisions [of the Statute of Westminster] is the assumption that a Dominion may itself change the rules of succession to its own throne (because it could now legislate in a manner that was contrary to British laws, such as the Act of Settlement, that had previously applied by paramount force)."[http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/02/the_royal_succession_and_the_d.html]

''None of the above means the wording is ideal, but does confirm the gist of it'' (Mies. above) amounts to saying that the words in question, viz.,  'As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment' is an editor's personal interpretation of the content of the three sources cited, which, in the case of Lagasse and Twomey are argumentative not factual, and in the case of Rouleau, are ''obiter'' unless necessary for the determination of the issue before the Ontario court in ''O’Donohue v. Canada'' decided  10 years before the act of 2013, the purport or effect of which could not have been argued in those proceedings, and which has practically no bearing on the effect of the 2013 act, and will have none unless it forms part of the necessary reasoning for the final determination the current legal proceedings in Quebec.

It is redundant to say that someone's family is related to them.  The constant repetition of Canada and Canadian is also redundant since the article is about the "Monarchy of Canada."

Second, an ''official'' residence does not imply its always occupied by the office holder. There have been prime ministers that have never moved into the Sussex residence for example, and an "An official residence is the residence at which a nation's head of state, head of government, governor or other senior figure officially resides. ''It may or may not be the same location where the individual conducts work-related functions, <u>or actually lives</u>''." So, the question of day to day residency is irrelevant to a discussion on official residences. And the Queen of Canada doesn't have any non-Canadian residences, so adding "Canadian" is a bit redundant, akin to saying the Canadian Queen of Canada. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 20:54, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
::::While "official residence" may not mean where someone always lives, it is usually where someone normally lives or at least least lives part of the time.  That's the understanding of the average reader, and if the Queen does not live there that should be mentioned which is overly complex for an info-box.  The Queen's main "official residence" is Buckingham Palace, which is where she issues proclamations concerning Canada and also the contact address, both on the Royal Family's website and that of the governor general.[https://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14611]  Also we still do not have any ''reliable'' sources that Rideau Hall is her official residence.

:::::You're confusing the person with the office. Elizabeth II lives in a variety of places, occupies a variety of offices, and fills a variety of functions, all of which are irrelevant to this discussion. The Queen of Canada is an office, the office officially resides at Rideau Hall and the Citadel of Quebec, thus "official residence", in the same way as the office of the Prime Minister of Canada officially resides at 24 Sussex and Harrington Lake (office and official being the key words here). Justin Trudeau may never step foot in 24 Sussex drive, and his mailing address may continue to be David Johnson's backyard, that doesn't change or have any effect on 24 Sussex remaining the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada.

===Buckingham Palace?===
Says [http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-queen-elizabeth-1.3335960 here] that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with Queen Elizabeth II at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Perhaps there's a mistake here, unless he's just visiting the Queen of the United Kingdom. Afterall, the Queen of Canada resides at [[Rideau Hall]]. You'd think he would've visited Elizabeth II at Rideau Hall first, though. But again, maybe he wanted to meet the British monarch first.

The title attaches to the office, the debate on which I want not to get into.  My point was only that, when the Canadian PM met HM in Buck House on exclusively Canadian business, he met Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada.

#Rideau Hall as an official residence of the Queen of Canada is a verified fact.

It appears clear that these place are the Queen's Official Residence, wherever she might be and in whatever role she might be in (acting as Queen of Canada or otherwise). Deleting this information will not benefit the article, and altering it as suggested will not reflect the facts either and seems to be pushing some sort of POV.

Seeing as ''3'' individuals (I'm assuming Miesianiacal still opposes) now oppose my proposed changes. There appears little chance of getting a consensus for it. I'm a practical type, so I won't be pushing for these changes any further.

:G'day [[User:Outback the koala|Outback the koala]]:  you might like to visit your ancestral Australia, where the Governor-General has an official residence but I don't think I've ever heard it referred to as the monarch's (sound of Aussies ROTFL). I'd say the article on that residence, [[Government House, Canberra]], gets it just right:  
::'''Government House, Canberra''', commonly known as '''Yarralumla''', is the [[official residence]] of the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] of [[Australia]]. ... The [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], [[Elizabeth II]], and foreign heads of state stay at Government House when on official visits to Canberra.
:Now that I've managed to locate the [http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?param=130&art=820 Galbraith] article, I see that he claims (without direct evidence) that Rideau Hall is the official residence of the Governor General as well as of the monarch, while La Citadelle is the Governor General's "secondary" residence, and were resided in by the royal couple on the very first occasion when a reigning monarch had visited any of the imperial dominions:  1939.  That they stayed there surely doesn't make those places their official residences;  what has to be shown is that they stayed in those places because they were their own official residences and not just places the Governor General put them up in when they weren't spending most of the rest of the month chuffing around on the royal train. (And, making my day BTW, Galbraith says they arrived in Canada on a liner named ''Empress of Australia'' ...)  Nearly fell out of my gumtree.

:I think the key point is:  either some legal document (preferably an act of the Canadian parliament) designates Rideau Hall or La Citadelle as official residences of the monarch of Canada, and none has been shown;  or they have been so established by custom, and a first arrival as late as 1939 (first at La Citadelle - "Réchauffez le rosbif!") plus a few visits thereafter (assuming that they stayed there) hardly suffice. If there is any such document, let it be cited. [[User:Wikiain|Wikiain]] ([[User talk:Wikiain|talk]]) 00:37, 8 December 2015 (UTC)

::::Those sources don't seem to me to be reliable if they don't provide legal documentation, as they very easily could if it exists. I don't know whether they do; but, since they keep getting cited without mentioning any such evidence, which could conclude the matter, it seems that they don't.  A national anthem, such as that of the UK, can become so through long and consistent usage - a few stopovers are not comparable.  What private corporations do is beside the point.

:::::Unless you want to copy and past the whole section in, my response to you will seem slightly bizarre in the section below otherwise. It's a bit of a disaster right now in terms of organization as an editor decided to start four or so separate conversations on this page, as well as a few places on other talk pages as well, so....
:::::To respond: A sources reliability is not dependant on "legal documentation". When the Government of Canada says, in an official publication, which places are official residences of which office, that is evidence in itself. Since the governor general doesn't have any powers or authorities beyond those of the Queen which have been delegated, that the office of GG doesn't actually own anything in its own right, and the fact that the office of the GG is simply a vector of representation of the office of the sovereign, then quite clearly the office of the GG only occupies Rideau Hall for example, on ''behalf'' of the sovereign who actually has title. 
:::::Now, while all that makes sense in terms of Constitutional theory and Canadian law, it is original research as no source has been presented which explains the relationship in that way. However, we do have multiple sources which say, including those of the Government of Canada and the Parliament of Canada, that Rideau Hall and the Citadel are the Queen's Canadian residences. So you, or I, can speculate and postulate and throw theory back and forth, but it's not up to us or our opinions and original research, but what the sources actually say inline with Wikipedia's policies.

:1. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research forum ("Wikipedia is not a place to publish your own thoughts and analyses or to publish new information"). The fact is that the Citadel and Rideau Hall are the Canadian residences of the Canadian sovereign and their their representative, the Governor General. That is the simple fact supported by over 7 reliable references, and quite frankly doesn't have anything to do with my opinion as the article simply reflects reliably sourced facts, in accordance with Wikipedia policy. If you want to conduct a research project, go ahead, but this isn't the place to publish original research. And if are requesting that I conduct original research for Wikipedia, the answer is no. 
:2. How foreign countries arrange their state residences is completely irrelevant to this article and the facts at hand. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 02:51, 7 December 2015 (UTC)
::That's right.  And that is why for unusual claims we used high-quality secondary sources that provide footnotes so that we know where they got their information.  As you say we do not conduct original research here but rely on well-documented researched sources.  This reminds me of long disputes over whether the Queen is Duke of Normandy.  She is not but several monarchist sources say she is and it took a lot of research by editors to find a paper explaining the facts.  But all that can be avoided by using good sources.
::The examples I provided are not foreign countries but countries that share the same sovereign in personal union and other than the UK all developed as colonies with the same system of government each with a governor representing the Queen and residing in an official residence.

:::No idea about Duke of whatever, don't see how it's relevant.

::::You keep bringing up issues that have nothing to do with the discussion.  Commowealth nations are not "foreign", they are external.  But none of that has anything to do with your theory that the Queen resides in Rideau Hall, the Citadel, and provincial government houses based on a glossary and some articles by monarchists.  You need to show a record that makes it official , such as the 1867 order that made it the official residence of the governor general.  If you have reasonable curiosity, you might wonder whether Victoria every resided there.  Maybe It became the official residence when England came under threat in 1939.  Talk to me.  Where does this fact derive?  Is it statute, order in council or common law?  Why does the monarch simultaneously not reside in the dozens of other government houses?  Is this unique to Canada?  Does the Queen have her own bedroom and does the governor-general have to vacate?  Have you thought about this?

:::::I'm actually simply responding to your points, so if issues are being discussed here "that having nothing to with the the discussion", then perhaps you should re-evaluate your points, such as how foreign countries organize their residences, which as you say, has nothing to do with this discussion about Canada. And, yes, Australia is a foreign country to Canada, as is every other Commonwealth realm. Foreign of course means "situated outside a place or country; especially :  situated outside one's own country" / "born in, belonging to, or characteristic of some place or country other than the one under consideration" / "of, relating to, or proceeding from some other person or material thing than the one under consideration". Seeing as these countries are "situated outside" of Canada, and are 'belonging to a state other than Canada', they are by definition, foreign countries.

:The above comments read as if, unlike TFD,  trackratte has lost track (can't help it, no pun intended) of the points under discussion: 1_That the sources s/he relies on fail to meet the valid objections made by TFD (no need for me to repeat them). 2_Either way, there is no need to have the item in the infobox, and the content of the article itself suffices.

:*Monarchy of Australia, nothing in infobox, section on "Vice-regal residences"
:*Monarchy of New Zealand, nil.
:Readers are in no way misled or denied notable information if the item is not in the infobox. The infobox fails to let readers know that the named government houses are customarily referred to as official residences,  and each is identified for that purpose by a local name, that they are occupied mainly as a residence by the governor general, and one of them more so than the other, and that both are available for use as a residence by the monarch when in Canada.  Keeping it in ought not be seen or felt as a point of honour for a proud Canadian, or a resident of Québec City. The two places are named in the Governor General's infobox as "Residence", which they are in the ordinary sense, and which is what the word would be taken to mean by the ordinary reader. Similarly, Governor-General of Australia names two "Residence"s in the infobox. There is not equality of meaning between the infoboxes for the g-gs and the monarch, as if the governor-general and the monarch are co-habitant residents of the same house at the same time. The nearest comparison would be a person who owns mansions in UK, Canada, and other countries, resides mainly in the UK, but has estate or business interests in the other countries, which are managed and directed by an agent appointed to oversee the owner's affairs in each of those countries, and who, in connection with that appointment, resides in the owner's mansion there, given the local nick-name "the guv'nor's house".

::::::::We've gone over this several times already. By the logic being used against the inclusion of the Queen's Canadian residences in the infobox, the Citadel should be removed from the Governor General's infobox, since the GG isn't actually living there right now but at Rideau Hall. 24 Sussex should be removed from the Prime Minister of Canada infobox because Justin Trudeau isn't living there either. And oh heaven help us, the Prime Minister of Canada infobox is misleading readers that Justin Trudeau is currently living at 24 Sussex. Except that doesn't bother certain members of this crowd for some reason. Oh, and if we need to remove residency from this offices' infobox, simply because "Readers are in no way misled or denied notable information if the item is not in the infobox", then we should be removing residencies from the PMs, Leader of the Official Opposition, and GGs infoboxes as well. 

::::::::This artificial and illogical construction ignores a few things, one's <strike>title to a property</strike> residence doesn't disappear the moment you step out of the house or leave the country, and the same is true for corporations. Second, these are not the residences of David Johnston, Elizabeth II, or Justin Trudeau, but in actual fact of the governor general, prime minister, and sovereign, so the individual people temporarily occupying these offices have nothing to do with it. In the same way the office of the CEO of company X, for example, doesn't change simply because John Smith isn't physically there. For that matter, the office doesn't change at all, even when John Smith is replaced by Jane Doe for example. Where an "individual is currently physically located", and where "an office resides" are two very different thing, and these two concepts are distinct. This isn't an infobox about a person, but an office. No one is arguing that Rideau Hall should be included in the Elizabeth II infobox. Finally, Wikipedia Policies apply. The fact is clearly sourced and verifiable.

:::::Let's look at each of your listed sources, [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]], or those of them that are weblinked:
:::::*''The Maple Crown'' is published by the Canadian government but is no way a scholarly work.  In any case, it claims that ''all'' of the Government Houses are official royal residences and that Rideau Hall is HM's residence "when in Ottawa", which supports [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]]'s compromise proposal.
:::::*Galbraith is in a journal that ''may'' publish scholarship.  I wouldn't discount it, but it's not strong.  And it doesn't speak for the Canadian government. 
:::::*Bousfield and Toffoli is just propaganda.  "Rideau Hall was her home, as much as Buckingham Palace in London or Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh" (p 10) is either daft or means only that she felt at home in it when she was in it.
:::::*Tildridge claims that all of the Government Houses are official royal residences, though Rideau Hall is "primary".
:::::None of these sources support their statements with any references - at least not in the parts that are available online.
:::::*Bousfield may have references, not visible online, but the index is included and I can't see anything relevant in it.
:::::*Shelldrake/Skraarup has references, but not on this point and some of those given are to ''Wikipedia'' ....
:::::My point here is not that any of these (except maybe the last) ought to have given legal references{{mdash}}some of them are just not that level of publication.  My point instead is that they don't, when such documentation should be very easy to find, and that makes them unreliable sources.
:::::In that case, as [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] asked earlier, legal documentation should be sought.  If it can be found, it should be cited from an official source or other reputable source such as [[CanLII]].  That would not conflict with [[WP:OR]], which states:  "Unless restricted by another policy, primary sources that have been reputably published may be used in Wikipedia".  This is well established WP practice:  articles on law cite legal documentation all the time and sometimes with a template for it.
:::::If relevant legal documentation cannot be found, in that way or in some better secondary source than those so far provided, the claim should not be made.  The relevance of similar monarchies, such as that of Australia, is that it cannot be assumed that a vice-regal residence is also considered to be a regal residence.  Thus that claim requires specific evidence.  So, such evidence should be sought and, if it can't be found, the claim should not be made{{mdash}}neither in the infobox nor in the article.

===Primarily used by the governor general?===
The sentence ''"The sovereign's principal official residences, as well as those primarily used by the governor general, are Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Ontario and Citadelle, in Quebec City"'', appears to read as though they are 'not' official residences of the governor general.  <br>
Also, isn't ''12'' sources all clumped together, not allowed on Wikipedia? [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 05:23, 9 December 2015 (UTC)

:What else would "those" be referring to if not "official residences"? Regardless, I see both your concerns (clarity of the sentence, and sources breaking up the text) as valid points.
:Perhaps "Each is a Government House, but may be customarily known by some specific name. The sovereign's and governor general's principal official residences are Rideau Hall in Ottawa and the Citadelle in Quebec City." or,

The presence of the Seal melds together the notions of authenticity, authority and the will of the Crown, while at the same time lending a certain prestige to a document....Our country's Great Seal is uniquely Canadian."

:GoodDay, according to Canada's legislation, if the first two in line were a brother and sister born after 2013, then the eldest would be the heir apparent, regardless of gender.  Barring an injunction, the heir would be crowned.  I suppose at some point a successful challenge could be made, which would nullify the reign.  It's also possible that one of the birther challenges would successfully show that Obama is not the real president of the U.S.  And the monarchy could also face a successful challenge from a Jacobite pretender.  The issue is how much weight to provide the opinion of the people challenging the legislation. I think the onus is on Mies to provide a reliable source saying it has better than a snowball's chance.

:"The law in Canada, binding the government and the Crown, is as enacted by parliament, unless a court of competent jurisdiction eventually rules otherwise. At present, the line is the same down to 27th. Thus there is little prospect of the heir apparent being any different in the near future. A difference would occur if a third Cambridge child is born and he is a prince, but not if she is a princess. It may be surmised that by the time Prince George is heir apparent, the supposed problem under the law of Canada will be resolved. Qexigator (talk) 22:15, 26 May 2015 (UTC)"

* '''Not known''' There currently exists two opinions: On one hand, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Ontario Superior Court (twice), other government sources, and some constitutional experts have said there are succession laws in Canada's constitution that can only be altered by Canada's parliament.
:* "[T]he rules of succession are part of the written constitution, but they are, in my view, part of the unwritten or unexpressed constitution and are therefore not subject to the Charter...
::[T]he rules of succession (and, in particular, the Act of Settlement) have constitutional status can be found in the treatment of that Act in the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1897... The fact that the Act of Settlement was indexed among the constitutional acts is a further indication that, despite the fact that it was not listed in the Schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982, the Act of Settlement was intended to be a component of our constitutional enactments." [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html Ontario Superior Court]
:* "The prohibition against Catholics succeeding to the throne has been part of our law since the Act of Settlement, 1701. This Act itself is an imperial statute which ultimately became part of the law of Canada." [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2013/2013onsc5046/2013onsc5046.pdf Ontario Superior Court]
:* Reference may appropriately be made to art. 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689, undoubtedly in force as part of the law of Canada..." [http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2519/index.do Supreme Court of Canada]
:* "In the 1940s, indeed, the Canadian Department of External Affairs actually put together a list of all the British statutes that applied as a part of Canadian law and they included in that the Bill of Rights, the Act of Settlement, the Royal Marriages Act, and the abdication legislation of 1936, all as part of ''Canadian'' law... There wasn't something separate or special about rules concerning succession to the throne that meant they ''only'' applied as part of the law of the United Kingdom, they did also apply as ''part'' of the law in each of these Dominions...
::"[The government] requested and consented, by way of an order-in-council, for that law [His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936] to be made ''part of the law of Canada''. So, to that extent, it's quite clear that the abdication law, which changed succession to the throne in relation to the United Kingdom, ''is'' part of the law of Canada." [https://vimeo.com/108335929 Anne Twomey]
:* "[T]here is a Canadian law of Succession existing not just through received law but through a Canadian statute. The statute is the Succession to the Throne Act passed by the Parliament of Canada on 31 March, 1937. That statute gave assent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom... [S]uch assent was morally but not legally necessary for the British act to extend to Canada since Canada had already 'requested and consented' that the British act extend to Canada through an invocation of Section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, 1931 by a Canadian order-in-council, and the British act had become 'part of the law' (to quote Section 4) of Canada on 11 December, 1936.
::But passage of the Succession to the Throne Act by the Parliament of Canada on 31 March, 1937 had the secondary statutory effect of establishing from that date a law of Succession for Canada by Canadian enactment if in fact none existed at the time by inheritance, as the Government of Canada now argues. That is to say, the Succession to the Throne Act of 1937 is the statutory repository of the law of Succession for Canada, so it is irrelevant whether or not the patriation of the Constitution in 1982 specifically incorporated the UK laws of succession into Canadian law, as that had already been done in 1937, and it was not necessary in 1982 to create a Canadian law of Succession since one already existed."

*'''Absolute''' - I'm no legal beagle, but it appears to me that in order to legally challenge something, that something must exist. As I'm understanding it, Quebec is challenging Canada's having allowed the United Kingdom to change the Canadian succession to ''absolute'' primogeniture, via rubber stamping the UK's succession act. Well, it appears to me that Canada must have done the deed, otherwise Quebec wouldn't be challenging ''anything''. Therefore, my previous changes should be restored. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 07:51, 18 November 2015 (UTC)

*'''Absolute, but reference the ongoing jurisprudence''' – The [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]] states that it is absolute primogeniture. While the law may be found to be ''ultra vires'' or otherwise unconstitutional by the courts, the same can be said of most any law. In the absence of reliable sources overwhelmingly saying that the law will most probably be found to be unconstitutional, we can hardly assume by default that it will be. However, of course we should always be referencing the fact that the law's constitutionality is in contention and that it is currently before the courts.

*'''Comment''': Largely concur with TFD above ("Absolute") and in discussion below, and differ from Mies. ("Not known"), but unless common law and the relevant statutes, up to and including Canada's of 2013, specifically use the  term agnatic (or cognatic) then it would be better to state the position without it, except perhaps in a well-sourced footnote. Whether described by an extraneous term such as "agnatic" or "cognatic" makes no difference to the law or the facts of the line.  I do not see either term in the linked articles [[Perth Agreement]] and [[Succession to the British throne]].  [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 09:11, 18 November 2015 (UTC)

*'''Absolute''', per points made by [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] and [[User:Graham11|Graham]], above, and the article should reflect that consensus until a court rules on the merits or stays implementation of the law by injunction pending a ruling, neither of which has occurred. I will be much surprised if any such terms as "agnatic", "cognatic" or "primogeniture" are found in any law, common or statutory, defining the succession. Those words are not used because they are those used in law; rather they are descriptors of the formula which is applied to the genealogy of the Electress Sophia to identify her heir pursuant to law. As editors, we are responsible for putting together words, nouns and adjectives, which explain how that formula is applied and label it as it is normally referred to (although "cognatic" seems to me an unnecessary and confusing neologism in defining succession formulae). We are not bound to use or avoid any particular words in the effort to convey the formula comprehensibly to Wikipedia's readership.

Reply to Miesianiacal:  We require reliable sources to determine the challenge to the law is significant, not our own opinion, which is prohibited by such policies and guidelines as [[WP:NEUTRAL|neutrality]], [[WP:SYN|synthesis]] and [[WP:FRINGE|fringe]].  Wikipedia editors are not required to be able to decide between legal arguments, but they are required to determine what weight should be provided to different arguments.  Having said that, you are misrepresenting primary sources.

While the Bill of Rights 1689 and other "Imperial legislation" may still be part of the laws of Canada, they are received laws that remain in effect until Canada amends them and are not part of the constitution requiring special amendment to change.  In ''R. v. Montague'' for example the defendant argued that Protestants had a right to bear arms and the court of appeal determined that the right had not been incorporated into the Canadian Constitution Act 1982.[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2010/2010onca141/2010onca141.pdf]  The Bill of Rights does not prevent federal, provincial and municipal governments from restricting or removing that right.  And to anticipate an objection, independence of the judiciary which is guaranteed in the Succession Act 1701 is part of Canadian constitution because it was incorporated into sections 99 and 100 of the British North America Act 1867.

While an Ontario Superior Court judge indeed said that the laws of succession were part of the "unwritten constitution" (para 28), in paras. 27 and 29 he said the reason is that Canada's sovereign should be same as that of the UK and other countries that currently share the same sovereign.

:::::::Well, you and he are going to have to get more detailed because there are issues either specific to the Canadian situation that aren't found at all in the Australian one, or are also found in the Australian context, but are contradicted by other claims in the Canadian one. For instance, the Australian article states "Succession is according to British laws that have been incorporated into Australian law". We do have sources that support the statement "Succession is according to British laws that have been incorporated in to Australian law". However, the government in 2013 was quite clear when it stated there are no succession laws in Canada. How is that going to be reconciled in this article? The sentence "Australia agreed to change its rules of succession only in agreement with the UK and the other then Dominions" doesn't apply here as, again, the government asserted Canada has no rules of succession to change. Also, there's the claim "Australia, along with the other realms, repealed the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which gave precedence to male heirs and excluded from succession a person married to a Roman Catholic." That's incorrect, as not all the other realms repealed the Royal Marriages Act, Canada being one of them. "In Australia, federal legislation to do this required request and concurrence from all of the states, so that the necessary federal legislation was not passed until 24 March 2015" simply doesn't apply to the Canadian story.
:::::::That's quite a lot of the succession section of [[Monarchy of Australia]] either eliminated or simply similar to material here that's valid and sourced, but contradicted by other sourced material. If you're going to insist the article state succession in Canada (or the British succession the Harper government said Canada follows) is by absolute primogeniture, there is more work to do than you maybe think. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 05:03, 20 November 2015 (UTC)

====A proposed rewrite====
Can we try working on this to open the Succession section?
:The [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]] was passed to change the law of succession from male-preference primogeniture, to absolute primogeniture. The act came into force on 26 March 2015.  The succession of the present queen and her predecessors since before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], was by male-preference [[primogeniture]] governed by [[common law]]... (etc.)....
[[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 18:13, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
:This version for the opening, describes the current status, accurately. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 18:25, 20 November 2015 (UTC)

:The Succession to the Throne Act 2013 didn't change anything, though; by both the content of the act itself and the then-government's argument. According to them, it was the enactment of the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] in the UK that changed the law of succession for Canada; Canada simply takes as its monarch whomever is monarch of the UK. As the Statute of Westminster is law in the UK, the UK required the "assent" of Canada's parliament according to convention iterated in the statute's preamble. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 19:43, 20 November 2015 (UTC)

The similar sentence "The [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013]], was enacted on 26 March 2015 replacing male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture, as it consented to the corresponding change in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|British line of succession]]" has been inserted in the article, but it still has no source to support it and contradicts what available sources say. Again: the Succession to the Throne Act 2013 did not replace or amend anything--read the content of the act to see none of that is in there. As such, there was no change to correspond with any other change. Further, the Cabinet at the time said it's the British act that changed succession. Period.

If you really want to sum up the current succession situation according to the previous Cabinet, you'd want something like "Succession for Canada is governed by British law; whomever is the monarch of the United Kingdom is automatically monarch of Canada. Though, convention iterated in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster 1931 requires the UK to have the assent of Canada's parliament for any alterations to succession in Britain to have effect." --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 03:23, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

====Further concern about opening ====
''"Which as enacted, took effect, in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2015"''.  Hasn't it also taken effect in Canada?

The ''bill'' refers to the content of the UK act (previously a bill), to which the Canadian act, which also operates from that same date, had assented in advance. That was the factual situation. The next paragraph outlines the state of the law before the proposed change, the next paragraph, the manner in which Canada was committed to the intent of the Perth Agreement (fully described in its own linked article), followed by the passing of the Canadian act in order to fulfil the committment, and the subsequent judicial review in Quebec on the question of the validity of the federal act, the detail of which is not the topic of this article.

::The previous opening version (before TFD's change) read as though the change took effect ''only'' in the United Kingdom.

:::I agree with TFD's comment at 21:42, 24 November.  An act which has the force of law in a country, such as UK or Canada, may have an effect in other countries, such as in respect of nationality or citizenship or trade barriers or generally when implementing an international treaty.  But we (that is Wikipedia) must await the ruling of a lawyer accredited with the skill, knowledge and  public responsibility of a judge to determine (at least at first instance), after taking into consideration the arguments advanced by the parties, whether the Canadian act is effective in Canada to accomplish what was intended. If the act is effective in Canada, then it will apply world-wide in determining what is the line of succession of the Canadian monarchy. In the meantime, with the Quebec government and the federal government as parties to the judicial proceedings, we are not in a position to treat the matter as of no more weight than fringe opinion among academic theorists identified with an insignificant political cause, though it may turn out to be of no more than passing interest.

The court has not dismissed the motion as frivolous, and we may surmise that the provincial and federal governments are not displeased to have an opportunity to have the propositions tested in argument to arrive at what can be expected to be a well-reasoned judgment, which could well be taken to the highest court on appeal, even if in the expectation of no more than an affirmation there.

Because the puritans of Massachusetts had done so, believing they were following a biblical injunction. New Englanders dominated the legislatures of the Maritime provinces in the early years and brought their legal culture with them. As a more democratic and egalitarian ethos emerged by Confederation, authorities quietly dropped the double share. In Ontario, the abolition of primogeniture was a much bigger deal. The Constitution of 1791 had provided for a landed aristocracy after all. Even though an aristocratic political order didn’t develop as planned, primogeniture symbolized a deferential, hierarchical society in a way that appealed to the colonial elite. Eighteen bills to abolish primogeniture failed before the reform finally succeeded in 1851. Even then, Ontario hung on to the fee tail, even as most other provinces abolished it, until 1956.

Who and what are "parts of the Crown" of Canada?[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&type=revision&diff=696225047&oldid=696213138] Why is not the GG? - see ''The Crown and Canadian Federalism'' By D. Michael Jackson, p.20

: The [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-21/page-10.html?texthighlight=crown#s-35. Interpretations Act], "An Act respecting the interpretation of statutes and regulations", defines the ''Crown'' as "'Her Majesty', 'His Majesty', 'the Queen', 'the King' or 'the Crown' means the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her or His other Realms and Territories, and Head of the Commonwealth", ie the Canadian monarch. In Canadian law, the Crown does not include the Governor General. That being said, as the Crown's representative, the Governor General exercises nearly all of the Crown's powers on its behalf, in line with the [[Letters Patent, 1947|letters patent constituting the office]]. So when we say "the Crown" we mean "Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada", and all laws and summons are issued by the Queen. So when we look at the latest [http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2015/2015-08-04-x4/html/si-tr77-eng.php Summons] for example, it states "ELIZABETH THE SECOND,...WE DO HEREBY, by and with the advice of Our Prime Minister of Canada, pursuant to section 38 of the Constitution Act, 1867, summon and call together the House of Commons...", which is to say Parliament is summoned by instrument by the Crown (Elizabeth the Second is, with the advice of her prime minister, summoning..). This is further underscored by official, professional, and academic sources which [https://www.gg.ca/events.aspx?sc=1&lan=eng "authorize the governor general of Canada to exercise powers and responsibilities belonging to the Sovereign"].

::Well and good, so far as that goes. But if, for the purposes of drafting and applying legislation, '' 'the Crown' means the Sovereign'' (ie the reigning King or Queen) it must be inconsistent to say  "the Governor General exercises nearly all of the Crown's powers on '''its''' behalf" unless there is tacit lapse into metonymy. Does "the Crown", in the usual discourse about the constitution, include the cabinet, the privy council, and those persons responsible for performing the functions of government attributed to the monarch or sovereign? And so, include the GG? Is there any source that excludes the GG? [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 22:31, 21 December 2015 (UTC)
:::{{ec}} I fail to see what polysemy or synecdoche have to do with the conversation, or what is your point therein. When discussing the Constitution, or any other law, the meaning of the Crown isn't subject to debate, as it is clearly and legally laid out. So no, the cabinet, the privy council, and persons responsible for performing constitutional or any other functions are not "the Crown", although they may exercise its powers. Advising the Crown and being the Crown are not the same thing. Thus, legally the GG is not "the Crown". [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 01:07, 22 December 2015 (UTC) 

::I can see already confusion is causing the problems here.
::This has nothing to do with the 1947 Letters Patent or parts of the Crown. It has to do with a clause in the Constitution Act 1867 that outlines it is the governor general who summons the House of Commons: "The Governor General shall from Time to Time, in the Queen’s Name, by Instrument under the Great Seal of Canada, summon and call together the House of Commons."
::Perhaps you're missing the first words of the paragraph: "Some of the powers of the Crown are exercisable by..." Nowhere is it denied the power to summon the House of Commons is the Crown's or, as such, the Queen's. Rather, it is a question of who ''exercises'' which of those powers and the Queen cannot exercise a power the constitution states shall be exercised by the governor general: "Constitutional authority James R. Mallory points out in his book The Structure of Canadian Government (1984) that legally 'the Governor General can exercise any of the Queen's powers in Canada.' The converse is not true, however; 'the Queen cannot exercise the Governor General's powers because they are conferred on him, and not on the Queen, by the British North America Act.'"[http://www.lawnow.org/role-of-the-governor-general/] (Though, there the notion of powers belonging to the governor general is being used as a simplification of the fact of those powers belonging to the sovereign, but being exercisable only by the governor general.) --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 01:00, 22 December 2015 (UTC)
:::A magazine article does not trump official or legal sources. The sole role of the governor general is to represent the Crown. The governor general does not ''have'' any powers or authorities itself but only those delegated to it by the Crown. Therefore, to say that the governor general has powers and authorities beyond those of the Crown is non-sense and contradicts the constitutional underpinnings of the entire Canadian system. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 01:40, 22 December 2015 (UTC)

:::If someone cannot legally exercise a power, then that power does not belong to them, as possessing a power by definition means to control it. What you/your source is saying, is that the power to summon parliament is beyond the control of the Crown, which directly contradicts Sections 9 and 10 of the Constitution, as well as sources from the Government of Canada amongst others. Keeping in mind, in accordance with the Interpretations Act, the Crown legally means the sovereign and nothing else, so "the Crown" does not mean the governor general, as the governor general only exists to act on the Crown's behalf. 

:::Section 10 of the Constitution Act 1867 states that any mention of the governor general is to mean the office "carrying on the Government of Canada on ''behalf'' and in the ''Name of'' the Queen". Subsequently, section 38 does not bestow any powers upon the governor general independent of the Queen, only saying that the governor general is responsible for summoning the House of Commons on the Queen's behalf (as in 1867, as now, the sovereign is not physically present to do so). No where does it say that the Crown (sovereign) ''cannot'' summon the House of Commons. 

:::Also, the [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-21/page-5.html?texthighlight=majesty%E2%80%99s+majesty#s-17. Interpretations Act] states that '''"No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her Majesty or Her Majesty’s rights or prerogatives in any manner, except as mentioned or referred to in the enactment."'''. Thus, for the law to restrict the powers and prerogatives of the Queen, it must ''explicitly'' state so. Stating that the governor general will summon the House of Commons does not mean that the Crown is restricted from doing so. In order for a law to do so, it must explicitly state that the Queen is barred from summoning the House of Commons, which it does not.

:::The summons themselves are done by the Queen and issued by the GG (you can read the actual summons, the Queen is doing the actual summoning in the document). The Government of Canada states that it is the Queen that summons Parliament. Barring a court ruling, magazine articles reflecting unsubstantiated personal opinion does not contradict the laws of Canada, or the stance of the Government of Canada.

# Section 38 does not say that the Queen is barred from summoning parliament, it says that the governor general will do so in the Queen's name. Saying that the governor general has powers that the Queen does not contradicts the constitutional basis of executive authority in Canada, in that the GG is the sovereign's representative and has no independent authority beyond this mandate, ie the GG does not possess any powers or authorities beyond those of the Crown. 
# The word "shall" used within the section [https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/wschiess/legalwriting/2005/05/shall-vs-will.html generally means] "'has a duty to' and use it to impose a duty on a capable actor", which is to say the section imposes the duty to ensure that the House is summoned from "time to time" by the GG. In the context of the times it was written, it makes sense as it would be impossible for any one person to be able to summon all of the provincial houses, the federal house, as well as various houses all throughout the world. So this duty was automatically bestowed upon the GG, but there is nothing barring the Crown from carrying out this duty itself.

"Crown" means, in line with section 35 of the Interpretations act ("(1) In every enactment, “Her Majesty”, “His Majesty”, “the Queen”, “the King” or “the Crown” ...means the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her or His other Realms"). So, the Crown has only ever delegated its responsibilities, powers, and authorities, never transferred them (inline with Letters Patent 1947). The Queen summons the House of Commons through proclamation, as "parliament can only legally be summoned by authority of the Crown (Queen)" where the proclamation is issued by the Crown representative, the governor general, on the sovereign's behalf (wording of proclamation is issued from the Queen, not GG). The reserve powers to summon parliament, according to reliable and official sources, reside with the Queen. The governor general, as the Queen's representative, issues the summons in the Queen's name and on her behalf, inline with section 38, but does not actually summon parliament themselves (according to the summons themselves). 

There is nothing suggesting that section 38 is to be read in isolation from section 9 (all executive authority vested in the Queen), or section 10 ("Provisions of this Act referring to the Governor General extend and apply to the Governor General...carrying on the Government of Canada <u>on behalf</u> and <u>in the Name</u> of the Queen"). Which is to say all further sections within the Act are to be read in line with sections 9 and 10. Lastly, section 38 no where suggests that the Crown's powers are not exercisable by the Crown.  So to suggest that the governor general is able to exercise authorities beyond those of the Crown is absurd. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 01:10, 22 December 2015 (UTC)
:I have not, nor does the article, mention delegation of powers or sections being read in isolation or the Interpretation Act. That's all rather straw man-ish and certainly an over-complication of a simple matter. The power to summon the House of Commons belongs to the Crown (as all executive authority is the Queen's, according to S.9, and as recognised by the part of S.38 that says the governor general acts in the Queen's name). It is only the governor general who is named by S.38 as the person who ''exercises'' that particular power. The Queen, thus, cannot herself use her own power to summon the House of Commons, as explained in the source I provided. The governor general must do it for her. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 01:27, 22 December 2015 (UTC)

::By that logic, if you name someone to do a task on your behalf, such as clean your house, that person ''must'' always do that task for you and you are legally barred from doing it yourself, ever. That makes absolutely no sense. What if the governor general isn't there to do it? Well, then it's done by an administrator, even though the governor general is specifically named. The same logic applies to the Queen, except that when the Act was written and the with the technology at the time, it was thought virtually impossible for the sovereign to ever be there, so the sovereign's representative was named, in the same way that if the governor general is not expected to be there, the administrator would be named on a piece of paper somewhere to perform the task of issuing the summons. And once again, the summons are actually done by the Queen when you read the actual summons themselves, it is the Queen who is summoning the House, not the governor general, the governor general only ''issues'' them on the Crown's behalf. Thus, the sources saying that the Queen summons parliament, represented by the governor general. There is no basis in law saying that the Queen cannot summon Parliament, in the same way that there is no basis saying that the Queen cannot open Parliament.

#[[User:Miesianiacal|Mies]], the Interpretations Act is most certainly not irrelevant, and is not overriding anything, it is a legal requirement on how already existing terms are to be ''interpreted''. For example, the common law principle of Crown immunity already exists as an established principle of common law, however the Act defines explicitly how this legal principle is to be interpreted in relation to Canadian Acts. Thus, Parliament has made it very clear that if an Act does not explicitly restrict or remove a power of the Queen, it cannot legally be interpreted as doing so, and this principle has been enshrined in statute law as well as common law. Thus, the fact that there simply is no law which removes the ability of the Queen to summon Parliament is most definitely ''not'' a strawman argument, but is quite obviously central to the entire discussion. It is essentially illegal to interpret section 38 of the Act as removing an ability or prerogative from the sovereign. 
#Subsequently, not only does the author in that magazine article not explain the reasoning behind his statement that the Queen is legally barred from Summoning the House of Commons, but their statement also contradicts central principles of the Canadian constitution itself (executive authority is only ever temporarily lent by the Crown, ''never permanently transferred''), Canadian common law (Crown immunity), and Canadian statute law (nothing affects the sovereign's prerogatives unless specifically stated otherwise), in addition to official sources ("Parliament only meets at the Royal Summons of the Queen", "the duties of Her Majesty the Queen including...summoning and dissolution of Parliament"), as well as other published source ("the Crown [the sovereign] can summon Parliament at any time"). Quite clearly then, the weight of legal, official, and other reliable sources quite clearly and explicitly underline the fact that the Queen can and does summon Parliament. The fact that the governor general, as the Queen's representative, is named as responsible to ''issue'' the summons on the Queen's behalf in no way impedes with, modifies, or interferes with the Queen's own prerogative powers in any way. Delegation does not equal permanent transfer. 
#Section 10 of the Constitution Act, 1867 constitutes the office of governor general as the stand-in of the monarch, stating that the office only acts "on behalf of" and "in the name of" the Queen. Subsequently, whenever the person of the sovereign is physically not present to execute their duties, the governor general fills these duties and legally speaking, ''is the sovereign/is the Crown'' when executing these powers and authorities. Thus, when the governor general issues the Summons, in legal terms this means that the Crown is issuing the summons itself. The Act quite clearly establishes this office as proxy, in the same way that messages or orders can be issued from an authority via another (such as the chain of command in the military, of which incidentally, the Queen as represented by the governor general, is at its apex). As a result, to state that the governor general has the authority to execute a duty but the Queen does not, is to say in legal terms that the Crown has the authority to execute a duty but the Crown does not. Logically, N cannot both be untrue and true at the same time, representing the statement of the author that the Queen cannot execute her own prerogatives and responsibilities as logical fallacy.  
#As we can see in the same situation elsewhere, the fact that the governor general is specifically named as Commander-in-Chief in no way removes the Queen from this position, as once again whatever the governor general does in their official capacity is as the representative of the Queen. As we can see, the Queen is quite clearly still the Commander-in-Chief. In the exact same way, simply naming the governor general to fulfil a function such as summoning, does not remove this function from the Queen. 
#While I am in no way attacking you personally, and I do not think that the opinion that the Queen cannot summon Parliament is yours but is merely relayed from that magazine article, it is clear that that source represents the personal opinion of that specific author. Thus, in terms of sources, there is no way that that person's unsubstantiated personal opinion supersedes the abundant number of legal, official, and other (more) reliable published sources we already have. The fact that the governor general, as the Queen's representative, is legally responsible for issuing the summons on the Queen's behalf is true. The fact that the Queen cannot summon the House is clearly not.  [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 15:57, 23 December 2015 (UTC)

Thanks for all those comments following the question at the top of this section. Given that the constitution operates "pursuant to unwritten constitutional conventions and are, in theory, the same for all Commonwealth countries that have retained the Queen as head of state", [http://www.revparl.ca/35/2/35n2_12e_Hicks.pdf] perhaps we may recall, at the risk of SYNning, that an indication of what was intended by  "the Crown" after the flight of James II is given by the act (given the name "[[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]]" by SLRA 1948), which does not actually define or contain the word "Crown", but has a (long) title expressing its purpose or motivation as  "An Act for Recognizing King William and Queene Mary and for avoiding all Questions touching the Acts made in the Parliament assembled at Westminster 13 February 1689", while the act (from 1951 "Crown Recognition Act (Ireland) 1692) passed in the Kingdom of Ireland was "An Act of Recognition, of their Majesties undoubted Right to the Crown of Ireland" (1692). Those acts were in force at the time of the formation of Canada in the 1860s, and have continued in force in UK to the present day. A question may arise: why "the Crown", not  "the Throne", or the monarch or sovereign?  Are these really synonymous and interchangeable in all  RS contexts discussing the constitution, without any change of shade of meaning? Is it not generally understood, according to context, that, in practice, when two or more countries  have the same person as monarch, the Crown has come to be used to signify the monarch as advised, and governing by the agency of, the  '''keeper of the great seal''' of the realm (used for summoning parliament, for proclamations etc.) and other responsible officers of state and ministers of the Crown in that country: historically and today in England, Ireland, Scotland, Britain, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand? Similarly, "Crown dependencies". In that sort of context, the Crown may be referred to by the impersonal pronoun "it" (and if a term of Greek etymology for such a figure of speech is lacking, doubtless one could be invented, just as "Commonwealth realm" has conveniently gained currency). Meantime, other terms have come into use by judges or experts seeking to describe and explain the evolving character of these institutions, such as "reserve powers" and "divisibility".

:The UK does not have a governor general, although from time to time they have a regent who is given powers not assigned to the reigning king.  Also, it is questionable whether Australia (at least at the federal level) has unwritten constitutional conventions because of the unique circumstances of its creation.  So it is speculation to what degree their rules are the same.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 01:35, 23 December 2015 (UTC)

::Not sure about the relevance here of either of  TFD's points in that comment.  The lead sentence under discussion was specifically about the exercise of certain powers by the monarch or the monarch's representative in Canada.  I do not see the Hicks article ''The Westminster Approach to Prorogation, Dissolution and Fixed Date Elections''[http://www.revparl.ca/35/2/35n2_12e_Hicks.pdf] (linked above, and in the article) inconsistent with TFD's remarks. My quote above was from the abstract of Hick's article, which reads in full: ''The Queen has various reserve powers, or personal prerogatives, including prorogation, dissolution and summoning of parliament, and dismissing and appointing a prime minister. The use of these powers is pursuant to unwritten constitutional conventions and are, in theory, the same for all Commonwealth countries that have retained the Queen as head of state. Yet in practice they operate differently – far more democratically – in England, where the Queen is present, than in Canada, where a governor general has been appointed to represent the Queen and manage these powers on Her behalf. This paper examines the British approach, contrasts it with the Canadian, and shows how Canada could improve its democracy by adopting the British practices.''

Despite the fact that this article is clearly about Canada, having the "Canadian Royal Family" makes sense in the same way as "Her Majesty's ''Canadian'' Ship" (HMCS) to differentiate between "Her Majesty's Ships of the British Navy, or the [http://www.mint.ca/store/template/home.jsp "Royal ''Canadian'' Mint] to differentiate between the [http://www.royalmint.com/ Royal Mint], Her Majesty's ''Canadian'' Government from Her Majesty's Government, and the list goes on. The exact same logic applies here, as the Canadian Royal Family is a specific institution and should always be used in the same way as the Royal Canadian Mint. Within the same paragraph or section for ease of use for example, the first instance would normally be the proper noun, while following instances would not, for example "The Royal Canadian Mint is a...." followed simply by "the mint specializes in...", etc. In the same way here, the first instance and all section headers should be Canadian Royal Family, and all subsequent instances could simply by "the family".

::I'm saying that as a proper noun in the same way as the "Royal Canadian Mint", or "Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or "Royal Canadian Navy", the header should simply be "The Canadian Royal Family", in the same way as "Canada's mounted royal police and constabulary" would be awkward as a title, instead of simply using its proper name.

::::Well, like I said there already exists a proper title, and the proper title is in common use in official and media sources when used to refer to that specific institution. As there are ideological persuasions on both side of the argument, I think it would be a simple matter in the interests of fairness to simply use the proper noun in the title and in the first sentence like we would do anywhere, and thereafter use the short form, "family". For example, if a monarchist and a republican were having a debate on what to do with a section on the RCMP, one side might want something like "Her Majesty's Royal mounted police for Canada" or something, while the republican may want "the Canadian national police force", well why don't we just try to see past our biases and use the proper name of RCMP. And yes, I realise I have my biases, I am a constitutionalist, so I prefer whatever is 'proper', 'official', and normally written down somewhere. It just so happens in this case we have plenty of verifiable sources for the neutral presentation for the proper name, whereas any other usage veers into the realm of editor personal preference instead of proper sources.

The Canadian Royal Family is a distinct legal entity from the Royal Family (implying UK unless it is explicitly stated), so even though the article is about the Monarchy of Canada, I think it is still worth putting in. If you need precedent for adding "Canada" as must as possible, look at literally any government department. The UK throws crowns onto everything; we throw on the word "Canada". Either way, probably not worth much more debate. The world will keep spinning either way :) [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]]<small> ([[User Talk:Ajraddatz|Talk]])</small> 09:27, 8 January 2016 (UTC)

== The 2013 Succession Act ==

How shall we interpret the wording of this Canadian succession act? Did it come into effect because of the passing of the British 2013 Act? or because of the changing of all the Commonwealth realm successions, which include some of them (like Canada) merely defering to the UK's Act.

== How old is the Monarchy of Canada? ==

''"Canada is one of the world's oldest monarchies..."''? This sentence just doesn't read correctly to me. I'm assuming it's taking its cue from [[List of Canadian monarchs]], but according to the infobox, the Canadian monarchy isn't quite old compared to the European monarchies for example. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 21:36, 28 November 2015 (UTC)
:...it's 'taking its cue' from the academic, peer-reviewed, journal reference which is the big "13" smack dab at the end of what you just quoted. 
:I'm not too sure about the infobox date, or what sources it is based on. Reliable references explicitly tackling the start date of monarchy in Canada use 1534, with unexercised claims from 1497. The first monarchical Canadian government was established in 1534 for the the colony of Canada. 
:The Constitution Act, 1867 states that the Canadian government and executive authority is simply "declared to continue" and "be vested in the Queen". Command in chief of the Canadian forces was also simply "declared to continue and be vested in the Queen". In reference to the office of sovereign of Canada, I have seen nothing within the Constitution Act 1867 to state that there was anything beyond a simple "continuation" of the office and its authorities within Canada.

::::Makes sense, there is no requirement to have a date in the infobox at all, or certainly not any pressing reason for this very moment. The British Monarchy does not have a date of formation in the infobox either.

We also have a boatload of reliable sources, including peer-reviewed academic journals and official sources, which state that Canada is one of the oldest continuing monarchies in the world, and that monarchy in Canada was established as of 1534. I don't think changing the scope of this article to only the Dominion of Canada is feasible, it would needlessly disperse the current topic in a bunch of different articles, there is nothing to support a 1867 start date as the Constitution merely stated the current institution was to continue, and would be a lot of work only to make it more difficult for the reader to have a proper overview of the topic.

All of the sources stating 1534, coupled with the fact that the Constitution Act explicitly states that the role of sovereign of Canada was simply to continue in 1867 not be created, was the reason I didn't put 1867 as an option as it contradicts too many legal, official, and other reliable sources.

{{outdent}}The info-box for Canada mentions 1867, 1931 and 1982.  While the confederation was a merger (unlike Australia) between existing provinces, it is usually given as a start date of the country.  And despite the fact New France was acquired through conquest, it was ceded through treaty and there was continuity between New France and British North America.  Political institutions continued, and Catholic bishops swore allegience to the King of Great Britain.  1534 is problematic because Nfld was merged into Canada, which already existed, hence is not a predecessor state.
I would not use 1931 though since there was no change in the Crown or Canada's legal relationship with it.  The King continued to be King of Canada as had George III.  The only change was that he ceased to receive advice from his UK ministers.[[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 21:10, 13 December 2015 (UTC)
:1534 has nothing to do with Newfoundland (which by the way it is not known that John Cabot landed there, only somewhere on the East coast of North America, likely Newfoundland or Nova Scotia). 1534 was when Canada was established in the name of King Francis I. In 1867 two colonies joined the colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, to which territories were gradually added over the following 80 years. 
:Second, we are not talking about the establishment of the Dominion of Canada, but of monarchy of Canada. All of the sources say that the actual line of sovereigns of Canada began in 1534 with Francis I as King of the French colony of Canada (with unexercised English claims from 1497).

===British Nationality Acts, Institutional Evolution, and other "into the weeds" discussions=== 
Canada was a British colony/dominion prior to 1931, with British subjects, so the British Crown at the time wasn't in any sense "foreign". In the same way that John A. Macdonald wasn't a foreign prime minister, even though he was a British subject and born in Scotland.  
The existence of a Canadian monarchy in the same sense as the existence of a Canadian people (les Canadiens) since the founding of Canada in 1534. The official stance of the government of Canada is that the Canadian monarchy as a form of government was established as of 1534. In the same way as Canadian governors general have existed "in an unbroken line since the appointment of Samuel de Champlain in 1627".
The crown evolved along with Canada (which makes sense as they're legally one and the same), so Canada was French until it was British until it was completely sovereign. Commensurately, the Canadian crown was French, then British, then completely sovereign. Unless you're saying that there is no such thing as Canadian history prior to 1931 because it was actually British history...

:I am not saying that Canada began in 1931, that is what you think your opinion the Canadian crown was created in 1931 means.  BTW Canadians did not cease to be British subjects, the 1981 Nationality Act merely changed the term to "Commonwealth citizen."  Not sure whether your misinterpretation of the law has anything to do with your position.  Whether or not Canada has a history has nothing to do with whether it is a monarchy.  But the issue is when that monarchy began.  You claim it began in 1931, when you believe the crown was divided.  GoodDay dates it from when Canada was united.  But now you bring up the King of France.  That's where your other (contradictory) argument might be valid.  Because AFAIK he was not simultaneously King of Canada.

::So you are telling me what I think my opinion is? I highly doubt it. And you are confusing the creation or establishment of an institution with institutional change.

Just because it transitioned from a British para-government, to British business, to Canadian business, to American business, does not change the fact that it was created in 1670 and has existed since then. 
::Just because we acknowledge it became "American" in 2003 does not mean we are saying it was created in 2003, in the same way that our acknowledgement that the Crown became uniquely and separately Canadian by 1931 does not mean it was created in 1931.

:::The Citizenship Act did not remove the status of British subject, but created a new status.  Check out pre-1982 Canadian passports that say, "A Canadian citizen is a British subject."  Following the change to British nationality law they now say "Commonwealth citizen."  I do not understand your HBC comparison.  HBC is a legal person, (a corporation) whose personality does not change when its shares are traded.  But the queens of Canada and the UK are two separate legal persons (corporations sole.)  According to you, before 1931 there was no sovereign of Canada, merely a British one.
::::{{ec}}Um, no, Canadian passports do not say "Commonwealth citizen" anywhere, they say "The bearer of this passport is a Canadian citizen". Are you Canadian?
::::And a corporation sole is a legal person, so your confusion will likely be cleared up with a bit more research. The "personality" of the King/Queen of Canada does not change when the person filling that role does, in the same way as a President/CEO/ownership change does not affect the status of the HBC as a legal person. I'm not too sure what you are not understanding in that regard.
::::And no, before 1931 there certainly was a sovereign of Canada, and I've never said anything different as the sources are clear. The fact that the sovereign of Canada was French at one point, or that the sovereign of Canada was British afterwards, or that the sovereign of Canada is now Canadian, does not change the office of sovereign of Canada as a corporation sole. This, in the same way as Canadian governors general were all French and British before the appointment of Vincent Massey in 1952, which in no way made it so that Canada never had governors general before that date. Canada has been a monarchy since 1534 according to reliable sources (peer-reviewed academic journals, academic university publications, official publications, and a miscellany of other published histories, books, websites, etc). So, the fact that Canada has been a monarchy since 1534 isn't up for debate in terms of Wikipedia policy in the main space due to the overwhelming number of reliable sources. If we change the name of the article to "Monarchy of the Dominion of Canada" then there would be a clear reason to have 1867 I suppose, but then we would have to go through a great deal of trouble breaking up the current article, and having "Monarchy of the Colony of Canada", "...of the Canadas", "...of the Province of Canada", etc, which I think does a great deal more harm than good as there would be a tremendous amount of overlap and needless dispersion making it harder for a reader to achieve a good overview of the topic.

::::Canadian law does not bestow Commonwealth Citizenship, it merely ''recognises'' the status of certain other countries national statuses, and accords this status on non-Canadian citizens. Section 32(1) deals with Commonwealth countries "other than Canada", Section 32(2) deals with countries which still retain British Subject status, and Section 33 deals with Citizens of Ireland. If you are a citizen of Canada (with no other citizenship) then you are ''not'' a citizen of the Commonwealth (in the legal sense, but are in the sense of being a citizen within a wider community, like a citizen of North America for example). Canadian citizens are Commonwealth citizens under British law, which affords certain privileges for Canadians entering the UK, such as I believe working for the UK civil service or joining the British military.  
::::Wikipedia explains it as a "Commonwealth citizen is a person who has that status under ''British nationality law'' and ''may enjoy some privileges in the United Kingdom''...<u>Each country can determine what special rights, if any, are accorded to ''non-nationals who are Commonwealth citizens''</u>.

But the Act does not "merely recognise[] the status of certain other countries national statuses."  It says that Canadians are Commonwealth citizens which is the new term (in most cases) for British subjects.  Canadians are British subjects under common law (both in England and in Canada), as are Irish citizens but the terms Commonwealth citizen and Irish citizen are now used.  You appear to be tailoring your facts to new information provided to you.  I suppose your view is that the Canadian crown depends on Canadians ceasing to be subjects.  But in common law, subjects never owed allegiance to the corporation sole, so your argument makes no sense.

Canadian citizenship, introduced in 1947, did not replace the common law status of subject, but Canadian legislation gradually removed the rights and privileges of British subjects and reserved them for Canadians only, including the right to enter Canada and to vote there.  But none of this appears to be relevant to when the Canadian crown began.  The House of Lords says it began when the first administration was created for Canada, while according to you it occurred in 1931.

* have no opinion but happened to read something the other day that may be of interest  Quote [http://www.revparl.ca/27/2/27n2_04e_trepanier.pdf Peter Trepanier Canadian Parliamentary Review 2004] ''In Canada the legal embodiment for this change, The Royal Style and Titles Act, was approved by the Canadian Parliament and was established by Royal Proclamation on May 29, 1953. The Act conferred legally and publicly, on the eve of the Queen’s Coronation, the principle of a distinct constitutional monarchy for Canada. Elizabeth II was equally Queen of Canada and the United Kingdom. The monarch remained shared, but the institution of monarchy had now evolved into independent constitutional entities''-- [[User:Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) 21:41, 13 December 2015 (UTC)

::Thanks.  There have long been discussions about when the Canadian crown was established.  That was finally settled in 2005 when the Law Lords, citing one of the opinions in the 1982 patriation case, decided there is a separate crown when there is "an established government of the Crown in the overseas territory in question. In relation to Canada this had clearly happened by 1867."  In any case, her previous title referred to Canada, since it was one of her "British Dominions beyond the Seas."

:::I would say that the legal description of the sovereign of Canada as "of Canada" (nationality) and the title "Queen of Canada" were legislated in 1953. The institution of the Crown ''in Right of Canada'' was established as soon as Canada had an "established government" beyond a simple extension of that of the UK (that one UK law case cited by TFD states that this was the case "''by'' 1867" suggesting that this was likely the case before then, and in fact Canada had "an established government" in 1840 as well). In terms of legally having a Canadian Crown as distinct from that of the UK, it has been widely recognised that this was the case by 1931. In summary, there was a lag between the emergency of a independent institution, and the commensurate style and titles being legislated for.

::::No it is generally recognized that the Canadian Crown has always been distinct from the Crown of the UK.  The theory that the Crown was divided in 1931, while once popular, is a distinctly minority position today.  Canadian nationality was established in 1947 and the Queen's title was changed in 1953.  But note even before the change it referenced the dominions of which Canada was the first, and of course the new title gives primary place to the UK, with Canada being mentioned second.  Furthermore, official titles do not determine official roles, rather they are meant to reflect them.  So the Prince of Orange for example is not the actual prince of Orange, as Orange was ceded to France.  I have provided lots of primary and secondary sources explaining the division between the two crowns and suggest you read them before repeating your opinion.

Many of the arguments and assumptions made in this article about the Canadian monarchy being separate and distinct need to be revisited in light of the ruling in Taillon and Motard today. See, for instance, Lagasse's argument that such a ruling means there is no distinct Queen of Canada (see [http://policyoptions.irpp.org/issues/september-2015/the-first-and-last-queen-of-canada/]) [[User:Alexander&#39;s Hood|Alexander&#39;s Hood]] ([[User talk:Alexander&#39;s Hood|talk]]) 01:09, 17 February 2016 (UTC)

{{ec}}This has already been dealt with at length by constitutional experts and academics, particularly in terms of the sovereign as corporation sole. No one has ever said that Elizabeth II and her heirs are not British, nor that the process of selection of the ''person'' is a uniquely Canadian one. If Canadian courts determine that, as a matter of Canadian constitutional law, the current Canadian succession methods of the person of the Canadian sovereign are to be inline with those of the British sovereign unless changed by Parliament, this does not change the current nature of the office itself. If it had fundamentally changed the office of Queen of Canada, it would have triggered a need for constitutional amendment. Which is all very well and good for a talk page, but as others have said, amateur opinion from journalists and wiki editors alike is insufficient.

::Yesterday's court ruling states, at para 67, that <u>'It is subsequently as of 1931 that the existence of a Canadian Crown separate from that of the British Crown appears, which is to say a distinct head of state despite that the two States designate the same person'</u> (my own translation, read it for yourselves if you'd like). It also goes on to cite jurisprudence that the rules of succession are part of the constitution inasmuch as they are not challengeable under the Charter, as one part of the constitution cannot override another. Second, the Act of 1867 in a variety of areas (such as succession or parliamentary privilege) is not the ''source'' of law, but through its preamble recognised constitutional laws already in incorporated and in operation (para 153). The crux of the issue is that, due to the Constitution Act 1982, British laws are inapplicable to Canada, but the Succession Act does not give force to the British Act, only acknowledges that Canada agrees to its principle, and the ruling acknowledges that if Canada had not expressed consent, the Act would have passed anyways. As much of the Canadian constitution is unwritten, the matter of constitutional law determined by the Court was that the Canadian law is that the person of sovereign of the UK is automatically that of Canada, and thus the actual Canadian law itself has never been altered. According to the news article, it is expected that this decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Regardless, the current ruling is very clear that the Queen of Canada and the Queen of the United Kingdom are completely separate and independent of each other, and that the rules governing the office itself, are separate from the rules governing who can fill that office. Ie. Canada has the power to change its own succession laws, but the fact that Canada uses identical succession rules with the UK has absolutely no bearing on the office of Queen of Canada.

Let us not get carried away, in French or English. If the court ruling  is to be appealed, it will be imprudent to treat it as having settled any contested points of law. Even if it is upheld and affirmed in its entirety on appeal, the reasoning in such matters, whether or not universally accepted by persons with the necessary skill and knowledge (aka, "experts"), is not always readily understood even by otherwise well-informed laypersons, though some may take this or that from it, by inference or direct quote. However clearly the judge has expressed his reasoning, it is doubtful whether it can, at this stage, be taken as a definitive ruling ''that the Queen of Canada and the Queen of the United Kingdom are completely separate and independent of each other, etc...'' But one thing is certain: the judge has rejected the application submitted by Motard and Taillon for a declaration that the act of 2013 was unconstitutional  for the reasons stated in paragraph [2].

The reasoning is an odd construction, as succession rules form part of Canadian constitutional law, but the one and only rule within this constitutional law is 'whomever the British have selected'. So the basic argument in the decision seems to be that the British legislation itself is completely irrelevant to Canadian law as it doesn't, and cannot, change that one Canadian succession rule. Canada itself, by passing the 2013 Act, hasn't made any changes oncesoever to Canadian succession law at all. Kindof like the National Defence Act stating that command will be "according to regulation" and that's all it says, so if the regulations governing command were to change, the law itself would remain unaffected, ie 'the rules have changed by the law has not'.

However, the fact that the s.4 provision explicitly states that the assent of Canada is to declare that the British law "be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion" which seemingly undermines the entire core argument that via this means the British law is ''not'' extended to Canada, because that would be against the Constitution Act 1982. Bit of a nightmare. The determination that the details of succession do not form part of the roles, responsibilities, and constitutional powers of the office itself seems relatively straightforward, so it makes sense that the change doesn't require constitutional amendment in that regard.

So, if parts of the Act of Settlement are part of the Canadian constitution (in written form or by convention) (this is supported by the earlier Ontario Superior Court ruling), yet, no law of the UK can extend to Canada, how were those parts of the Act of Settlement within the Canadian constitution amended? Again, are they assumed to be amended because the UK amended the Act of Settlement within its jurisdiction? What Canadian law says that's supposed to happen?

==Motard v. Canada (Attorney General)==
A text version of the decision in the Motard case is now available in text version [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qccs/doc/2016/2016qccs588/2016qccs588.html here].  Editors can cut and paste the contents into Google translate and receive a readable version.  In his decision, Justice Bouchard quoted Section 9 of the British North America Act 1867:  "The executive government and authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.
"  The Queen is identified in the preamble as Queen of the UK ("federally united into one dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom....")  Therefore the Queen of the UK is automatically Queen of Canada.

The imperial laws and common law of succession are not part of the Canadian constitution nor part of the "office of the Queen."  While the succession act in the UK is a law, in Canada it is a fact.  The Canadian law is declaratory, it does not determine the succession but acknowledges it.  The same with the Canadian OC and law acknowledging the abdication of Edward VIII and the consequent change in succession.  So no more arguments about two kings ruling in different realms during the crisis.

I think the article should acknowledge this as the mainstream view, while accepting that we can mention alternative views.

A number of people well studied in this matter have disagreed with the judge's opinion; other court rulings (including from the Supreme Court) don't seem to align with it.

::It will be easier once there is a body of literature about the issue.

:::The Queen of the UK is not automatically the Queen of Canada, as the court clearly states that the offices are separate and legally distinct since 1931. The court also notes that when the preamble was written, Canada was still part of the UK and not independent, so it is the principle of symmetry that is taken from the preamble for the decision, not that the ''office'' of Queen is shared by the two countries. The ''person'' designated as Queen of the UK is automatically recognised as Queen of Canada in accordance with Canadian law. It seems minor I guess, but it makes all the difference, otherwise as Lagasse has noted, it would amount to a Quebec court finding that Canada is not a sovereign state.

*"Au demeurant, la règle de la symétrie faisait en sorte que ''la personne désignée'' Roi ou Reine du Royaume-Uni l'était aussi pour le Canada."(para 146) The person is shared, not the office. 
*"En outre, lorsque le Parlement impérial adopte la Loi de 1867 qui crée la Confédération canadienne, ''le Canada demeure subordonné au Royaume-Uni'' de la Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande et l'article 129 de cette loi réitère la règle voulant que les lois impériales ne puissent être modifiées par les législatures de la fédération nouvellement créée. Le préambule de cette loi revêt aussi une grande importance, puisqu'il rappelle que ''l'union fédérale n'est pas indépendante et demeure sous la gouverne du Royaume-Uni'' de la Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande. À cet égard, la PGQ s'en remet à l'opinion de la professeure Twomey qui énonce que ''lors de la constitution du Canada en 1867, il y avait seulement une Couronne'' et que les lois applicables à l'occupation du trône s'appliquaient d'emblée aux colonies, dont le Canada, qui n'avaient pas le pouvoir de les changer... Ainsi, toute référence à la Reine dans la Constitution du Canada ''était une référence à la Reine du Royaume-Uni''."(paras 34-37) So, a literal reading of the preamble cannot be made today, as when it was written, Canada was a British colony (dominion) and all references to the sovereign were to the Queen of the UK. 
*Since 1931, this is no longer the case, as all references to the sovereign are to the Queen of Canada (Interpretations Act) and para 67 of this ruling: " C'est donc à partir de 1931 qu'apparaît l'existence d'une ''Couronne canadienne séparée de la Couronne britannique'', à savoir ''un chef d'État distinct malgré que les deux États désignent la même personne physique''." Which is to say since 1931 the office of the Crown has been separate and distinct since, even though the 16 countries designate the same ''person'' as their "distinct heads of state". 
*So, your own personal interpretation based on a plain reading does not jive with current Canadian law, nor the judge's verdict. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 15:37, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

:::No, I'm not. Para 146 is from the conclusion and states:
::::"[146]     Par ailleurs, le Canada n'avait pas à modifier ses lois ni sa Constitution pour que les règles de succession royale britanniques puissent être modifiées et effectives; l'assentiment à celles-ci suffisait selon le préambule du Statut de Westminster et la convention qui s'y trouve.  <u>Au demeurant, la règle de la symétrie faisait en sorte que la ''personne'' désignée Roi ou Reine du Royaume-Uni l'était aussi pour le Canada</u>"
:::Para 141, which you've interpreted using a plain reading in ignorance of the judge's reasoning above, restates what is written in the Constitution Act of 1867, which as they describe above, no longer applies literally but the ''principle'' which they draw out does, that of symmetry. They then proceed through paras 142 to 145, to quickly outline the Constitutional evolution since 1867 and what that means to the present case through 1931 Statute, 1936 Abdication, and all the way up to the 1982 Constitution Act mentioned in para 149.
:::You also must remember that all of this is to provide us with the ''reasoning'', the decision itself is only held in para 150, "le tribunal est d'opinion qu'une modification aux règles de succession royale au Royaume-Uni ne constitue pas une modification de la Constitution du Canada". The ruling itself is not to determine the status of the Canadian Crown, but to determine whether a constitutional amendment has to happen for a change in succession rules to take effect. That being said, the conclusion clearly states that, based on the constitutional principle of symmetry derived from the quote in para 146, "<u>the rule of symmetry</u> ensures that the <u>''person''</u> designated as king or queen of the United Kingdom is also designated as such for Canada".

:::::You seem to be bringing in your personal conflicts into this discussion, what other editors quoted or removed from an article has no bearing on this discussion. The assertion that the Queen of the UK is ''currently'' the Queen of Canada is countered in the court decision by para 146 and para 67, as well as the broader context explored by the courts on how this situation has changed since 1867, specifically in 1931 and 1982. If you don't see a distinction between sharing a person (having the same person be two separate sovereigns), and sharing an office (sharing the same sovereign), then let me know as that likely means it's a semantic issue and we're not understanding the same things from what these words mean (or are actually meaning to say the same thing and are just talking past each other). Regardless, the Court has made it clear that Canada and the UK have two separate and distinct sovereigns, even though both countries share the same person for both respective offices.

The issue is that the Quebec ruling, according to at least one constituational scholar, has implications for the status of the monarchy in Canada overall in particular in regards to whether and the degree to which there is a distinct Canadian monarchy.

::Mies, when you say the "Succession to the Crown Act effective only in Britain", you are saying that the Succession to the Throne Act is not in effect, as that's all the Canadian Act does. The fact of the matter is the current Act is in effect, and that fact has recently been upheld. While personally, I find the reasoning for this to be highly suspect, my take on the situation is really irrelevant. Although I find the argument for why no constitutional amendment is needed, the logic presented is straightforward, I cannot see how, since 1982, Canada can assent to the law of a foreign country such as the UK any more than it can assent to a law passed in the U.S. congress, however like I said, it doesn't really matter here. Perhaps if it proceeds on appeal and it's accepted into the Supreme Court they will do a much better job of tieing it all together and presenting it.

Our law states that whomever occupies the throne in the UK, Canada will have as their sovereign, and thus the personal aspects of the corporation are shared with the UK, while the institutional aspects are separate and distinct. Like I said, does this jive with precedent, other decisions, or common logic? Maybe not, but we can't write whatever we like. If certain things are irreconcilable, then we just don't mention them I guess. We could just get rid of the sentence with all of the names of the Acts entirely and say that the person occupying the position of Queen of the UK will also occupy the position of Queen of Canada in accordance with the constitutional principle of symmetry and footnote the recent decision, but I'm not really comfortable with that, and I think it's too soon without having word on whether it will proceed and be accepted for appeal.

:::::::"no succession laws in Canada" There's a difference between there being no indigenous succession law and there being no succession law at all. Clearly, the "Canadian monarchy" per se is governed by succession rules. All the statement that there are "no succession laws in Canada" means is that the succession rules are determined not by Canadian law but by laws that have been drafted elsewhere ie the UK.

In effect, the court stated that the British laws and rules therein are completely irrelevant to Canada. I honestly think that the political solution would have been to draft one law and have it passed in all 16 parliaments, or for Canada not to have drafted a law at all and left it at that. Barring that, for Canada to have passed a proper succession law, as Canada cannot "assent" to a British law anymore than an American one. However the court's decision says that it was actually completely unnecessary for Canada to "assent" via legislation, as the British laws are irrelevant to Canada because Canada's law is simply to be symmetrical with the others in the first place. So really the crux of the confusion is that the government passed a law that doesn't make any sense, and as Senator Joyal stated, the Act is more of a statement from Parliament than a 'law' in the commonly understood sense.

{{od}}Gents, if we can keep the wheels on the dialogue here. Everyone's been doing well in actually improving the article. I think we're all saying the same thing more or less. The British law is not part of Canadian law, and as the Court acknowledge, doing so is a legal impossibility given the 1982 Constitution Act. The Parliament of Canada essentially said "we're good with this", which once again, as the Court stated, all that was required was basically a thumbs up from Canada and not legislation. I think the fact that they decided to pass legislation in the first place is the root of all of this confusion. Previously, it was generally accepted that the previous succession acts were part of Canadian law in that they were inherited prior to 1982. Now this has changed, and Canada it seems never did inherit these laws, only the principle of symmetry. A bit of a pretzel, and of course we can debate if this ''should'' be the case, but there you have it.   [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 03:45, 19 February 2016 (UTC)

::::Ah okay, I wasn't sure to what comment of mine you were responding to. The UK is bound by the preamble of the Statute of Westminster as an Act of Parliament in the same way as to the preamble of any other Act of Parliament I would imagine. The latest court decision seems to say, in paragraph 109, that no legislation on Canada's part is required for the changes to take effect. In the same paragraph the judge states that in the hypothetical case where Canada disagrees with the proposed changes, it could simply refuse to provide assent. In para 142, it states that the required consent of the other dominions is a constitutional convention. I would imagine that if Canada were to refuse to agree to any changes in the rules governing succession, it would require the introduction of a domestic Act of succession, as well as a constitutional amendment to break the rule of symmetry expressed within the Constitutional Act 1867. However, inline with my interpretation of this recent ruling, such a constitutional amendment would not be under the unanimity amendment formula, since it is not a change to the office of sovereign according to this ruling.

Another interpretation might be that the pertinent British laws are part of Canadian law through inheritance so had to be amended by the 2013 legislation, although these laws were inherited into Canadian law, they were never a part of the constitution (thus no constitutional amendment), although the recent court case states that no modification to Canadian laws are necessary.

A convention is a rule that is not legally binding.[https://books.google.ca/books?id=gAezmBsPrEoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false]  So the change to the succession is legally binding, even if the convention referred to in the preamble to the 1931 act is not followed.  That the Canadian parliament should express agreement is also part of the convention.  The 1931 Act says, "it would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom."

:::::::I never said the preamble had "legislative power", which I think you mean "legally enforceable", I said it was binding, which if it were not, it wouldn't be considered a constitutional convention.  A preamble to an act ''may'' be legally enforceable to the extent that it's cited by courts to justify their decisions, even if not explicitly legally binding, as they are a declaration of parliament on the reason why the Act is being made along with any reconciliation or historical background (which is why it can be properly understood as having "legislative power" in stating the aim of the legislation, but is not legally enforceable). For example, the preamble to the 1867 Act is routinely cited by the courts, including providing the source for the recently enforced principle of succession symmetry. Another example is [[Provincial Judges Reference]] where the preamble was used to justify the ruling, although it was controversial it was a Supreme Court ruling, so there's not much anyone can do about it. In any event, a bit of a sidetrack, as this doesn't necessarily reflect how British courts or more importantly Parliament would treat the dominion consent convention in a hypothetical scenario. In the hypothetical scenario the UK wished to embark on unilateral change, then it seems that the changes would affect Canada automatically unless Canada refuses assent, amends the constitution, and passes domestic succession law, as the only current law apparently is that of symmetry.  
::::::::As for the second point, yes, and interesting, in that it was the Queen of Canada who gave assent to the changes via the 2013 Act based on advice of the QPC, and the Queen of the UK that enacted it based on the advice of their QPC, both based on the (assumed) personal preferences of Elizabeth II.

{{outdent}}It is not binding, which is why it is a constitutional convention not a law.  The only way Canada could have prevented change in succession would have been a constitutional amendment, but of course that would have to be proclaimed by the Queen's governor-general.  Indeed preambles are citing in courts because they provide the intent of legislation.  As explained in the ''American Law Dictionary, edition 2'', "Generally a preamble is a declaration by the legislature of the reasons for the passage of the statute, and it aids in the interpretation of any ambiguities within the statute to which it is prefixed. It has been held, however, that a preamble is not an essential part of an act, and it neither enlarges nor confers powers."[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/preamble]  However the reference to succession in the preamble does not explain the body of the act.

:You can read [http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/TeachersInstitute/ConstitutionalConventions.pdf this from the Parliament of Canada]. Conventions ''are'' binding, for example responsible government, the need for the government to maintain the confidence of the house, and a government falling on the loss of such confidence, the principle tenants for how democratic government in Canada works, etc are all conventions. The Supreme Court ruling things to be unconstitutional based purely on conventions found in the preamble have ''forced'' governments to change their actions. A convention is, by definition, politically binding. The preamble of the 1867 Act provides the foundation for the entire ruling at discussion. In certain situation it can be easier for a government to go against legally binding rules than it is to go against politically binding ones, and even more so for politically binding rules (conventions) that are recognized by the courts. The office of prime minister itself is a constitutional convention, but that doesn't mean that the governor general can simply not have one, or appoint me as prime minister even though they could de jure do so, even though such action would be immediately found unconstitutional due to binding convention. If such a hypothetical event were to occur and proceed to the courts, it would be found unconstitutional based on the preamble of the 1867 Act.

::Your source says "conventions are not laws....It is generally accepted that the penalty for breaching a constitutional convention is political, not legal."  But while the Supreme Court cannot overrule a breach of convention, it may comment on it if requested.  And governments frequently violate conventions.  In "Re: Resolution to amend the Constitution" 1981 the Supreme Court decided there was a convention that the government obtain the consent of provinces before seeking to amend the constitution in ways that affected the provinces.  The government went ahead with only nine provinces.  However the convention was written into the revised constitution so that no further changes can be made without consent of the provinces.  No Supreme Court ruling things to be unconstitutional based purely on conventions found in the preamble have ever ''forced'' governments to change their actions.

:::You have a peculiar habit of attacking arguments I've never made. I never said the source states that conventions are laws, so why do you mention it? I also said above that "A convention is, by definition, politically binding", so your quoting back to me that "the penalty for breaching a constitutional convention is political" is just proving what I've been saying all along. I said that conventions were binding (Oxford: "Obliged by law, circumstances, or duty to do something") which as the source states "Conventions are ''rules'' of the Constitution". Rules by definition (Oxford: "regulations or principles governing conduct or procedure within a particular area of activity: 'those who did break the rules would be dealt with swiftly'") are binding and enforceable. You are conflating the word ''binding'' with ''legally enforceable''. One can be bound by law ("obliged by law"), or by duty (professionally bound) or circumstances (ie politically bound). The political consequences of breaking convention can be severe. For example, if a minister were to break cabinet solidarity (a convention) they would find themselves out of a job with no legal recourse. If a government were to lose a confidence motion they would be ''forced'' to resign, which itself is a convention. Just because something is not legally enforceable doesn't mean it isn't enforceable at all. And yes, governments have ignored conventions in the past, just as they've been able to ignore legal rulings as well. The Government in Quebec in particular has not been afraid to invoke the notwithstanding clause. Just because a government has shown that it can break rules, political or legal, does not mean that those rules do not exist or that they are not binding in one way or another.

::::I suppose it depends on what one means by bound.  If Parliament breaks a convention when it passes a law, it is still a law.  In your example, while it may be a convention to not use the notwithstanding clause, a law that used the clause would still be enforceable.  As for political consequences, if there was public support to pass a law that the Supreme Court deemed contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, then there might be political consequences for not using the clause.  Conventions are nothing more than expectations of how the executive and legislature will behave.
::::This discussion arose over the issue of whether or not Cameron was required to obtain Canadian consent to change the succession rules.  I said it was a convention and therefore the changes to the succession rules are binding on Canada regardless of whether or not consent was provided.  Do you disagree with that?  Otherwise we are arguing semantics.

:::::{{ec}}Yes, the British parliament is required (in the political/convention sense, not legal) to achieve agreement prior to introducing changes. If they went ahead anyways, I would actually have to reread the decision, as we're basing all of this on the most recent ruling. I recall the judge saying that if Canada disagreed with a unilateral change, all it would have to do is refuse to give assent, which to me suggests that refusal to give assent invalidates or breaks the symmetry, necessitating (one would assume) the introduction of domestic succession laws and a constitutional amendment. It is the hypothetical space in between the refusal to give assent and the passing of new laws that hasn't been explicitly clarified as far as I'm aware. We can probably assume a unilateral change, if it immediately changed who was sovereign, would have effect in Canada, although like I said I don't recall it being very clearly laid out in the decisions.
:::::And much of our discussion revolves around semantics! Generally if I feel we're basing arguments on different definitions of the same word I'll post the dictionary definition I'm using in an attempt to clarify.

We may surmise that in practice the governor general and prime minister will proceed with issuing the customary proclamation in accordance with their oaths of office and of allegiance, which, taken together, bind them to the "Queen of Canada ''and her heirs and successors''".

: The court's decision seems to say that Canada has its own domestic succession law, but that it just consists of the symmetry rule, so Canada's succession laws are not connected to the British succession laws at all, in that one is not controlled, connected, or dictated by the other, as that would be a legal impossibility and unconstitutional. However, in practical terms, it means that all 16 realms jointly decide how they wish their joint succession to go, and each implement it according to their own domestic realities. In Canada's case, due to the only rule being that of symmetry, all that has to happen is for Canada to have said yes, we have all jointly made this decision and we agree. The United Kingdom is bound to make this decision regarding any changes jointly with the 15 others as well, so in this way you could say that their succession is connected to Australia's for example, but the fact remains that the decision remains a joint one. Of course, any single one of the 16 realms could choose to break with this convention and unilaterally change their own succession, or become a republic, however. Specifically to Canada and the UK, as long as both countries are committed to maintaining the same line of succession, the decision must be jointly made, and any break in this would necessitate either or both breaking with convention, and Canada having to introduce succession laws a little more detailed than the simply rule of symmetry.

::Track: The subtlety is that given Canada's law requiring the oaths of allegiance and of  office, nothing further is needed to let the succession take effect. The prime minister, the cabinet, all the members of parliament will have had personal knowledge of that when the assenting bill was passed.

:::I'm just not sure what would happen if Canada did not give consent, as I haven't seen an explicit mention of it in a reliable source yet, but yes we can make logical assumptions. For "symmetry" it was quoted in the Bouchard decision:
:::"...tout en reconnaissant par ailleurs le ''principe de la symétrie'', à savoir que la Reine du Royaume-Uni est aussi la Reine du Canada" (para 104)
:::"...it is axiomatic that the rules of succession for the monarchy must be shared and be in ''symmetry'' with those of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries."(para 104)
:::"des effets quant à la ''règle de la symétrie''"(para 107)
:::"...to preserve that ''constitutional principle of symmetry''..."(para 126)
:::"Au demeurant, ''la règle de la symétrie'' faisait en sorte que la personne désignée Roi ou Reine du Royaume-Uni l'était aussi pour le Canada."(para 146)
:::So the court makes continuous reference to the "principle of symmetry", the "rule of symmetry", and the "constitutional principle of symmetry" throughout to mean that the succession must be in symmetry within all of the Commonwealth realms, which as I understand it, is essentially Canada's only domestic succession law and is rooted in a constitutional principle found within the preamble of the 1867 Act. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 15:12, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
::::The UK and Dominions agreed on symmetry and acknowledged a convention in the 1931 Statute of Westminster.  But the reason the succession rules are the same is that the Canadian constitution recognizes the Queen of the UK as Queen of Canada.  So Canada's assent by order in council and by parliamentary resolution had no effect at the time of the abdication and would have no effect in the future.  As Bennett was quoted as saying, it was "declaratory," i.e., it acknowledged the changes that the King had enacted.

:::Not that I'm aware of. I think the sticking point is ''how'' it was amended and the fact that the word "primogeniture" isn't in any of the references. As it stands now, it explains the changes of the Perth Agreement, doesn't get bogged down in the "how" bit, and explains the 'non-male preference, catholic marriage not barred' bit without using the term. So, we're sticking just to the facts, what you want expressed is there just without the technical jargon, and so I don't see any content issue. Of course Mies and Qex won't hesitate to let us know if I'm wrong. Overall though, I think we've incorporated everyone's major points, and drastically improved the flow and content of the section, so see no reason why, with perhaps a little more copy editing, consensus can't be achieved going forward.

Mies has attempted to remove reference to the ''Succession of the Crown Act'' from the opening sentence, however the (Canadian) Succession to the Throne Act clearly reads: "The alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne set out in the bill laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom and entitled A Bill to Make succession to the Crown not depend on gender; to make provision about Royal Marriages; and for connected purposes is assented to."

We appear to <u>all</u> be in agreement, that the succession to the Canadian throne is identical to the succession to the British throne, which now means ''eldest child'' & ''marriage to Catholics allowed'', since March 2015.

:Whatever GoodDay may think it means, in my view it would be acceptable, if others agree, to let wording be added, somewhere, similar to the inline link to [[Succession to the British throne]]: succession to the throne of Canada  ''is determined by descent, legitimacy, and religion.

Mies' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&type=revision&diff=706472034&oldid=706406834 most recent edit and comment] is miselading as it overlooks the fact that he's obliterating references to the Canadian succession being the same as the British. If there are repititions then the later ones should be removed, not the earlier ones. It would appear he is on an idiosyncratic campaign to ignore recent court rulings and prevailing constitutional interpretations in order to push his POV that the Canadian monarchy is entirely distinct from the British. I think it's time for the article to reflect reality rather than reflect the idiosyncratic and quaint views of an outlier group. I've reverted Mies' latest edit (ironically, to the previous edit which was also written by Mies but which he seems to have had second thoughts about) and suggest that further edits to the section be hashed out and decided upon in Talk first.

:"Mies' most recent edit and comment is miselading as it overlooks the fact that he's obliterating references to the Canadian succession being the same as the British." In what way, exactly?

The UK is quite obviously among "the other Commonwealth realms".

::Right, the UK is bound by convention to seek consent from all of the Commonwealth realms, just as every Commonwealth realm is bound to seek consent for any changes they wish to make by the 15 others.

== NPOV ==

The article is biased towards a monarchist interpretation. I attempted to make the lede NPOV, based on nothing less than the source that the lede cited, and this was reverted. see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&type=revision&diff=707655983&oldid=707572778]

The source cited for the first sentence says in the section "concept of the crown"  (see [http://www.pch.gc.ca/DAMAssetPub/DAM-min-dept/STAGING/texte-text/ppc-chp_1360181037578_eng.pdf?WT.contentAuthority=18.0] "The responsibility for governing at the federal level is shared by the legislative, executive and judicial branches. Technically, all three powers flow from the Crown." The opening line however lacks this nuance and equivicality by saying "The Monarchy of Canada is the core of both Canada's federalism and its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy,[2] being the foundation of the executive (Queen-in-Council), legislative (Queen-in-Parliament), and judiciary (Queen-on-the-Bench) in the federal and each provincial jurisdiction". 

My suggested change was to "The Monarchy of Canada, in the form of the Crown, is part of Canada's constitutional strucure. Technically, the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the state flow from the Crown which is represented federally by the Governor General of Canada and provincially by lieutanant-governors.[2] being the foundation of the executive (Queen-in-Council), legislative (Queen-in-Parliament), and judiciary (Queen-on-the-Bench) in the federal and each provincial jurisdiction" which, while a reflection of a monarchist viewpoint, lacks nuance and also is contestable as many political theorists would contend that this concept is merely symbolic and does not represent the actuality of how federalism, let alone parliamentary government work. My change was reverted on a fairly weak ground, the claim that the lede is not for "technalities." Cute, but simply using the word "technically" is quite different from going into technicalities in detail.

: Not sure about "bias", but otherwise, as I understand it, while the rest of the comment is not far off the mark, something more concise than the undone edit would be better suited  for the lead. [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 14:48, 2 March 2016 (UTC)

:Although the sovereign does not personally get involved in administering Canada, the various branches act on the authority of the Crown.  That is actually different from a republic where they act on behalf of the people and is more than a technical distinction.  If you want to change the article (1) don't start by insulting other editors and (2) provide a source for your changes.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 15:15, 2 March 2016 (UTC)

:The problem with the proposed lead is, 1: "The Monarchy of Canada, in the form of the Crown" does not make any sense, as the monarchy ''is'' the Crown. See the Interpretations Act. 2: "Technically, the powers of the executive..." is problematic, as it is not a mere technicality but a fact enshrined in both practice and law. All Orders in Council, Instruments of Advice, and legislation must be signed by the sovereign or their representative to have any legal effect. The function of Canada's monarchical system of governance is, by definition, a "monarchist viewpoint" as Canada is a monarchy. To suggest that Canadian experts should have a "non-monarchical viewpoint" regarding Canada's monarchy is nonsensical gibberish. 4: Your assertion that the entire foundation of Canada's constitutional system is merely symbolic and "does not represent the actuality of how federalism, let alone parliamentary government work" is unsubstantiated opinion, and is clearly contradicted in numerous legal decisions, legislative acts, official publications, academic and expert sources, and the operation of government itself.

IP, define your conception of "monarchist interpretation". Canada ''is'' a monarchy, thus its entire system is inherently monarchical. So, to accuse Canadian authorities' and scholars' "monarchist interpretation" as biased is nonsense, in the exact same way as saying that "republican interpretations" of the office of the President of the United States are somehow POV. It is doubtful that adding monarchical interpretations to the President of the United States page would be adding "balance" or further a neutral point of view. The same can be said about adding non-monarchical interpretations to a page about the monarchy of Canada.

Your main issue seems to be that you feel that the lead was not adequately substantiated. I've since added two academic references from Canada's (arguably since the passing of Eugene Forsey) most respected and well-published constitutional expert. I can dig up more when I have the time. As you haven't mentioned anything else, I consider the matter at hand resolved, since the fact that the Crown is at the root of/foundation of/core of Canada's entire constitutional order is not a matter of dispute in any serious official, academic, or legal circles.

:Ok. ''My'' problem with the intro is that it does not reflect the reality of the monarch's status. I'm a monarchist myself, but reading the first paragraph makes me blush. Let's change it to something that reflects the political reality of the role of the crown, not the impression you'd get reading the written part of our constitution. You know as well as I do that in practice the powers of the monarch are executed through her governments and representatives, so I think the intro of the page should reflect that fact, rather than making it seem like the Queen is the #1 most important part of Canada (again, correct according to the written constitution, but clearly not the practice - and part of our constitution is the unwritten practices that can change and evolve over time). [[User:Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]]<small> ([[User Talk:Ajraddatz|Talk]])</small> 20:54, 3 March 2016 (UTC)
::Alright, I'm not a monarchist, making this conversation perhaps a bit ironic, but in this case perception does not make reality. No one is saying that the "Queen is the #1 most important part of Canada", a lot of people may think their morning Tim's is much more important. What is being said is that the Crown forms the core of Canada's constitutional system, and is the foundation (or source) of the executive, legislative, and judiciary, which is thoroughly well-referenced and is simply fact. Also, as outlined in numerous sources, the Crown can and must be able to impose its will in extremis, thereby "safeguarding the rights, freedoms, and democratic system of government of Canadians, and reinforcing the fact that 'governments are the servants of the people and not the reverse'", essentially providing a circuit-breaker function. Just because the circuit breaker has rarely ever "gone off" does not mean it is useless or non-functional, only that the systems of power are in good order and properly functioning. So, there is a reason why the role of the sovereign is still a legal reality, although quite rightly almost never acts upon these reserve powers as Canada is a stable, functioning democracy. If what you are advocating for ever became a complete reality, then the entire principle of the "sovereign acting as a custodian of the Crown's democratic powers and a representation of the 'power of the people above government and political parties'" would be completely destroyed. As we've seen in numerous instances throughout the world, democratically electing leaders can and has lead to despotism and tyranny, and so the pros and cons of aristocracy, monarchy, and republicanism were all carefully weighed by the fathers of Confederation in an attempt to mitigate the cons of each, and maximise the pros. Thus, the balance of the commons, the aristocracy (original intent for the Senate), and the Crown within Parliament for example. Of course the constitution has organically evolved in several ways, but the core concepts remain unchanged, particularly as it comes to the role and status of the Crown. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 21:25, 3 March 2016 (UTC)
::Secondly, the fact that "within a constitutional monarchy the sovereign's direct participation in any of these areas of governance ''is limited'', with the sovereign ''normally'' exercising executive authority ''only on the advice'' of the executive committee of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, and with the sovereign's legislative and judicial responsibilities carried out by Canadian parliamentarians and judges and justices of the peace" is already mentioned in the lead.

:::The problem could be that the monarchy of Canada could refer to the Crown, or to the mortal persons who wear it and their representatives.  While the latter are play a largely ceremonial role, the Crown itself is central to Canadian government.  We might say for example that theoretically the Queen owns the parliament buildings, we would not qualify the statement that it was crown property.  we might begin the article by drawing the distinction and consider separate articles.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 21:32, 3 March 2016 (UTC)
::::If I properly understand your proposal, we would be getting into tricky and largely unsupportable territory by dividing the monarchy or the Crown and the sovereign into separate articles, as the monarch and the Crown are one and the same, both in terms of machinery of government, and Canadian law. While it is useful to conceptually differentiate the natural versus the corporate person for theoretical discussions, such as the Crown Estate in the UK, it remains only a theoretical concept unsupported by Canadian law. If you mean a separate article for the present person, then that is already done with the Elizabeth II article.

:::::As you agree the person and the corporation(s) sole are distinct.  But we could have an article about the people who wore the crown, their families, and their relations with Canada.  For example talk about how the Queen has an honorary dental surgeon or that the Duke of Kent and Strathearn lived in Canada has no relevance to the Canadian constitution.  OTOH where or not the governor-general should have accepted the PM's request to prorogue parliament or should have appointed another PM seems more than theoretical.

::::::For a discussion on how different property estates are dealt with, or why taxes are voluntarily paid on some funds but not others the theoretical division of the corporation sole is a very useful conceptual tool, however as a very particular corporation sole they are indivisible in law. Which is all to say I cannot see how dividing the two into separate articles would be anything but a big messy nightmare. 
::::::As for breaking out the 'dignified' elements from the 'operational' elements of the Crown, it seems like a great deal of article consolidation to me. For example I believe a lot of honourary appointments could have their own pages or a brief mention, such as the list included at [[List of post-nominal letters in Canada]]. As for whether or not the GG should have accepted the PMs advice, that can only be found in articles such as the King-Byng Affair, and [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]] for example, so any mention of them here seems a bit much.

{{outdent}}The issue with the King Bing Thing and similar disputes is whether the Crown can choose the government at its own discretion or whether it must (or should) act on the advice of the current prime minister or parliament.  IOW it is about the role of the Crown in the Canadian constitution, about how the Crown is at the core of the Canadian constitution, and distinctions between the Crown exercising its discretionary power, the Crown-in-Council and the Crown-in-Parliament.  While the awarding of honours, why lieutenant-governors wear ostrich feathers and why the sea is boiling hot are all interesting indeed more interesting to some readers, they can be treated as separate topics.

Indeed a corporation sole is indivisible.  But each office is a different corporation sole and each is distinct from the incumbent.

The NPoV concerns brought forward, seem to be based on the practical side of the Canadian monarchy's role. In effect, the prime minister is boss in that neither the monarch or governor general ''veto'' his/her recommendations. Am I correct in my observations of your concerns, IP & [[User: Ajraddatz|Ajraddatz]]? -- [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 17:43, 4 March 2016 (UTC)
:Essentially yes. The current wording doesn't reflect the political reality of the Monarch's role.

:*{{ec}}The political reality is that the sovereign absolutely has a veto, that's precisely the entire point of why our constitution is structured as it is. The legal reality is that the sovereign has a veto. The political repercussions of the use of that veto are situationally dependent, and where the political costs of abuse of reserve powers is purposely extremely high as we have a constitutional democracy. Just because the system is working and the government (ie cabinet) acts according to convention and law does not mean that the role of the Crown simply disappears, in the same way that a circuit breaker doesn't simply disappear because the power system in your house is working properly. For any bill to become law, any order in council to have effect, or any instrument of advice to have effect requires the sovereign's approval, or that of their representative. For the PM to make an appointment, change a law, issue an order, send the military overseas, make an international treaty, call an election, etc, etc the sovereign or their representative must approve. That's both the political and legal realities, and is clearly articulated in government procedures, as well as cabinet and PCO manuals. Now, due to the tenets of responsible government, the Crown only 'says no' in extreme circumstances, as it is the politicians who bear the political risks and responsibilities for their decisions (ie the actions of the Crown), and so normally it is left to the Commons to decide on who governs and for how long. 
:*As we saw in 2008, the PM had to request prorogation from the GG, which was only granted under certain conditions which had to be met, and where these conditions were attached by use of the Crown's authority via reserve powers. We know that a potential veto in this case was absolutely a 'political reality' because the PM openly stated that if the GG vetoed his advice to prorogue, he would appeal directly to the sovereign, leaving it abundantly clear that absent the Crown's permission, the PM was ultimately powerless to prorogue. 
:*The LG of Saskatchewan reserved a bill in 1961, to which virtually everyone disagreed with his reasoning, however the bill was reserved regardless because he possessed both the legal and political authority to do so. 
:*The GG of Australia dismissed the government in 1975, despite the government retaining the confidence of the Commons. It was certainly a political and legal veto in this case, as the government was dismissed and was not reelected. Once again demonstrating how the Crown absolutely has a veto and can use it, and such a veto is both politically and legally binding. 
:*The core tenets of the constitutional system have been designed in a very specific way, for very specific purposes. The lack of need for a circuit breaker to constantly go off, or the Crown to constantly intervene to keep the system on track, simply means that the system is functioning, not that the role of the Crown has somehow fundamentally changed. Just because you have not seen or experienced the use of such powers, or are unfamiliar with these roles and purposes behind them, does not mean that they do not exist. 
:*As for the Australian monarchy article, it has no bearing here, and for the most part its lead seems overly sparse, simply stating that Australia is a monarchy (which goes without saying, or else the article wouldn't exist and is more suitable to the lead of the Australia article), that the Queen is Elizabeth II (once again, Australia article), and that the Queen of Australia is independent and distinct from the others. In other words, that lead does not really add any detail on the actual topic of the article itself (the Australian Monarchy) that is not already covered in the lead of the Australia article.

:The governor general can veto the PM's recommendations, as happened in the The King Byng Thing.  The role of the Governor-General has sparked constitutional arguments during minority governments, for example of Clark and Harper, or in Ontario on the selection of Drury and Peterson.  Would the governor-general have allowed Campbell to remain PM after the election had she requested a new election?  More often though the Crown will persuade the PM not to introduce legislation or an OC, which apparently happens in the UK frequently.  The Queen rejected some of the constitutional proposals that Trudeau made, and also Australian proposals on the role of state governors.  Government actions can also be quashed by prorogative writs, taking in the form of the Queen ''ex parte'' whoever brings the case v. whatever minister is responsible.

:::And purple elephants might've rained from the sky.

Or maybe the PM would've simply had to resign when rebuffed by the Palace.

:::::However, in writing about the issue, Professor Mark Walters, Professor of Law at Queen’s University wrote an article in the Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law that "The Governor General, as the Queen’s representative in Canada, ''has the legal power under the royal prerogative to make key decisions about parliamentary government''', including the appointment and dismissal of prime ministers and other ministers who form the government, the summoning of parliaments, the making of legislation by assenting to bills passed by the upper and lower chambers, the proroguing or ending of parliamentary sessions, and the dissolving of parliaments and the calling of elections. However, by constitutional convention the royal prerogative is almost always exercised on the advice of ministers of the Crown, in particular prime ministers, who are responsible to the elected members of Parliament. Through this principle of responsible government, royal authority is exercised in a democratic fashion...In the democratic age, an unelected King or Queen would never dare to use the royal prerogative in an undemocratic or arbitrary manner — but a Prime Minister might". This is from an academically refereed journal article, and runs in line with the stance of virtually every reputable expert in the field. 
:::::The fact of the matter is, the Crown possesses a veto, and must for the Canadian system to function. Whether or not Harper thought the GG had the authority to refuse advice was made evident when he said that he would appeal to the Queen if the GG refused.

Both have a constitutional monarch, both with specific constitutional powers exercised by representatives on the advice of governments, and both hold reserve powers which are never used in the modern context - that's what the lead section should specify, because those are the basic principles of the Canadian monarchical system.

Third, you are agreeing that the sovereign has a veto, and has all these constitutional powers, yet at the same time simultaneously say this is untrue (ie "not reflecting reality"), which is contradictory. Fourth, the basic and most important points of the Canadian monarchy ''are'' in the lead. What the monarchy is, who fills the office, why it exists, what it's roles are, how it functions, and how it interacts with the various other parts within the constitutional framework are all ''summarized'' in the lead.

While constitutional crises illustrate confusion between whether the incumbant or her agent uses discretion or relies on the advice of the PM or the legislators, the fact remains that both the PM and legislators exercise their powers on the authority of the Crown.  Hence proragative writs and prosecutions are taken out in the name of the Crown, there are Crown lands, military officers receive commissions and police carry warrants from the Crown.  Taxes are owed to the Crown, some corporations receive charters from the Crown.  Public officials and new citizens swear or affirm allegiance to the Crown.

::Miesianical removed "Under common law, the crown is inherited by an individual's children and by a childless individual's nearest collateral line. Male-preference [[primogeniture]] continues to apply for persons born before 28 October 2011 (the date of the [[Perth Agreement]]), absolute primogeniture for those born after."[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=prev&oldid=707678967]  That seems to be accurate.  Under common law, estates went to the eldest son or the daughter if there were no sons.  If there were more than one daughter, they shared the estate, but the Crown could not be shared, hence only one daughter could inherit.  But now there is no distinction between male and female heirs, so the crown is inherited by the eldest child, except for those born before the Perth agreement.

:{{ec}}Do we really need that entire paragraph within the lead? It doesn't illuminate what the monarchy is, why it exists, what it's roles and responsibilities are, how it interacts with other institutions within the constitutional order, etc. It seems to me that a simple one-liner would make more sense in summarizing the succession paragraph than an entire paragraph within the lede. Succession certainly isn't one of the ''most'' important parts of the Canadian monarchy, really if the succession changed completely the actual monarchy itself would be completely unaffected in terms of what it is, and what it does. Succession can certainly be mentioned, sure, I just think an entire paragraph is a bit excessive. Any mention of the Perth Agreement or resulting legislation most certainly is.

::Would you support a ''sentence'' about the topic? [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 00:04, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
Qexigator, the lede doesn't need to mention the Perth Agreement. Succession is probably important enough to warrant a mention in the lede; but, the Perth Agreement is only a part of the topic of succession. I see no reason to give it a place in the lede, yet not other aspects of succession, like the Act of Settlement and the Succession to the Throne Act 1937. But, if all that were given coverage in the lede, there wouldn't be a need for the succession section and the lede would contravene [[WP:LEDE]]'s guidelines. The lede now mentions succession, but the detail--including the Perth Agreement--is covered in the article body, as it should be. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 23:47, 4 March 2016 (UTC)

:: {{ec}}I don't think it's a question of reluctance, as it's already clearly stated in the succession section that it changed in 2015. Perhaps, "Succession to the throne of Canada is determined by descent, legitimacy, and religion, and under common law the crown is inherited by an individual's children and by a childless individual's nearest collateral line." immediately after the "heir apparent" line, as I think it makes the most sense there in terms of flow as we go from who's next in line, and a quick one-liner about why they are next in line. Further detail is amply available in the Succession section. Would everyone be more or less happy with that or no?

:<u>Proposed</u>: "Succession to the throne is determined under common and statute law and is inherited by the sovereign's eldest child, or in the case of a childless sovereign, the nearest collateral line."
:I removed "to the ''Canadian'' throne..." because it is not clear that the common and statute law bit is true, as it seems that the only Canadian law for succession is the constitutional principle of symmetry, which I think is best avoided entirely. However succession to the throne, I think, allows for a bit more accuracy while avoiding getting bogged down in potentially contentious detail for the moment.
:I put "sovereign" instead of "individual" as we're not talking about random individuals here, but only and specifically the heir to the sovereign. 
:Any mention of recent changes, or further detail are already done in the Succession section, and so I think this sentence does a somewhat adequate job in quickly summarizing the relatively minor point within the article lead.

:::::Perhaps we could say that upon accession to the the throne of the UK, the sovereign also becomes King or Queen of Canada.  The succession is determined by English common law and English and British statutes.  By convention the statutes are not changed without agreement with all the CRs.  I do not think the lead should go beyond this, because the article is not about the succession and detail could be provided later.  We need to be careful too in referring to common law and statute, because English common law and statute are not laws in Canada except to the extent they have been received into Canadian law.

If someone wants to know what those statute laws are and what they mean, or any further details I imagine they could go down the Succession section.

{{outdent}}We need to be careful about using the term statute.  The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 are statutes in Canada, but the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 which amends those acts is not a statute in Canada, and therefore the earlier acts in Canada are unamended.  It should be clear too that it is the "common law of England."  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 19:44, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
:That's why we avoided saying succession to the ''Canadian'' throne specifically, as apparently it is not governed by either statute or common law. However, to reduce the entire succession topic down to a single sentence about symmetry would be unhelpful. Essentially we are just stating by what rules succession is determined in the global sense, ie according to various statutes and common law, and avoiding the specifics in the lead. The nuances can be delved into in the succession section. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 22:27, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
:":It is not about symmetry.  Symmetry is not a law, it is the intention of the law.  And the reference to common law and statute is confusing because the common law of Canada is primogeniture and the statute law is that persons marrying Catholics are ineligible to inherit the throne.  The 2013 UK statute is not a Canadian law and has no force in Canada.  Nor does it change the English common law - statute cannot do that.  In Canada it is neither common law nor statute, it is a fact.  The only relevant Canadian law is that the sovereign of Canada is whoever is sovereign of the UK.  And who is sovereign of the UK is determined by British laws, which in Canada are not laws, any more than the laws of Portugal are Canadian laws.  In 1952, those laws were the same as Canadian law, but are now different.  So if the succession to the throne were still determined by Canadian laws, the plaintiffs in Quebec would have won their case.  The common law of Ontario btw says that the eldest male child inherits real property.  Statute says that the property is evenly divided.  But courts will normally assign the property to the persons named in the will, although a will is neither a common law or a statute.

==Unexplained image removal==
From my perspective, I didn't feel that I got adequate answers when I posted at my newly created sub-section of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GoodDay&oldid=712585629#Canadian_Republic User talk:GoodDay#Canadian Republic] about the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monarchy_of_Canada&type=revision&diff=712574148&oldid=712560174 removal] of an image of a royal standard at this [[Monarchy of Canada]] article.

:(As is so often the case) I can't make sense of GoodDay's "argument". This article is about the Canadian monarchy, not Elizabeth II. The Royal Family is a part of the institution of the monarchy and the section in which William's standard is/was located makes mention of the use of Canadian royal symbols by members of the Royal Family when in Canada or representing the country abroad. The article is full of pictures of Elizabeth II. It seemed refreshing/a good mix to include an image of the banner of a member of the Royal Family other than Elizabeth. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 00:22, 30 March 2016 (UTC)

::{{ping|Miesianiacal|BushelCandle}} I must agree that {{u|GoodDay}} had a valid point – this is an article on the monarchy, not on the royal family. As there is only one monarch at a time, the banner of William is inappropriate in any section except ''[[Monarchy of Canada#Canada's royal family and house|Canada's royal family and house]]'', but the banner of Charles as heir apparent should also be displayed if William's is to be displayed.

:::It's nice of you to support GoodDay, but doing so means you make just as little sense.

In this case, there's space for an image, the image in that space illustrates the adjacent text, and there's no copyright-free image of any other symbols used distinctly by members of the Royal Family when acting on behalf of Canada.

No one violated the letter of [[WP:3RR]], unless GoodDay had logged out and the IP is theirs, but this was still an edit war. Let's come to an agreement here about what should be displayed. As I said, I feel that BushelCandle's edit was a fair compromise, in that it displayed both HM's banner and the banner of a member of the Royal Family; I don't care which Royal Family member's banner is displayed, as long as HM's banner is displayed above it because this article is about the Monarchy. —&nbsp;[[User:Jkudlick|Jkudlick]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[User_talk:Jkudlick|t]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Jkudlick|c]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[User:Jkudlick/sandbox|s]] 23:36, 31 March 2016 (UTC)

== Coat of Arms ==
Given that the unofficial user rendition of the arms are offensive to some, and simply a poor representation to others, I propose we simply use the official 1957 rendition of the Sovereign's Arms in it's place. In the small text, we could simply put "1957 rendition" instead of the "unofficial rendition" that is there now. For users who wish to see the current rendition, they simply have to click on the Arms blue link immediately below the image. I think this would give a far more accurate and dignified depiction as it would be an official rendition approved by the Sovereign, as opposed to a widely disliked caricature. Lastly, I think the improved image would simply make the article look more professional and presentable honestly.

::So your issue is why would we show arms no longer used? Why then would we show Arms which have ''never'' been used?
::And the user rendition is not simply 'unofficial' in the opinion of some, it is not official point blank as a matter of fact as that user rendition has never been signed off and approved by the Sovereign. 
::The user rendition is ''not'' an accurate depiction. There are a million differences between the official approved depiction, and the user generated image. We're not talking about blazonry and what could be correct in heraldry here. We're talking about a very specific corporate image, in the exact same way that a Canadian flag with a "natural" looking maple leaf depicted instead of the official one would be an entirely correct interpretation based on the blazon, but that's not the point, ''[http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp there is only one correct depiction of the Canadian flag]'' and the same applies to the Arms.

However, as the [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/exhibit/national-flag-of-canada/ Canadian Encyclopedia] notes: "when the proportions and stylization of the leaf are not respected, the flag loses much of its beauty and impact". Once again, the same principles apply to the Arms, an entirely new depiction which does not respect the stylization and proportions loses it's "beauty and impact" as it is no longer the same image.

::Lastly, the [http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Government of Canada] is very specific on what exactly the Arms are, as there is only one correct depiction of this symbol of state.

::::::My point is at least they were the actual arms, as the arms of Canada are a very precise and specific thing, no other rendition is the Arms of Canada (although blazon based renditions are good to go in heraldry, they are not accepted by the state that the Arms represent and who actually have ownership over them). Although I do see your point, why would we use the old Red Ensign just because it was the flag of Canada before. However, the red ensign compared to the current flag are two completely separate and unrelated images. However, the 1957 Arms versus the 1994 Arms the difference is really only the circlet. Although they are both stylistically slightly different, the 1957 Arms are still much more stylistically closer to the current Arms than the user generated rendition, and the 1957 Arms are in fact the real and actual Arms of Canada from 1957. The user-generated Arms don't have any connection at all to the state, and were never approved by it. My last point, a subjective one, is that the 1957 Arms look much more professional on this page, as the user rendition looks cartoonish and amateur, due to style yes, but a lot to do with the bright cartoony colouring. 
::::::So when you ask, why would we use the old Arms? My response is because it is a far better than displaying Arms that were never used at all, were never approved, have no connection with the entity in question, and because the Arms are a very specific depiction as approved by the state which the user depiction is not, with the ancillary note that the user generated rendition (as has been noted by many other editors) looks unprofessional and cartoonish.
::::::Now, is your main sticking point your desire to defend the use of the user-generated caricature of the Arms, or that it is unacceptable to use an older version of the actual arms? [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 17:39, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::I'm going to have to disagree with you there because I see the user-created arms as following the blazon and therefore aren't inaccurate, though they may be a rendition not approved by the Queen. The differences between the 1957 arms and the current version aside, they simply are no longer used by the sovereign and so shouldn't be in the infobox as though they still represent the monarch. I'd rather see an accurate "unofficial" depiction of the arms presently used than a version of the arms no longer in use (and therefore not reflective of the blazon). --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 18:06, 5 March 2016 (UTC)

::::::::1. This conversation has absolutely nothing to do with the blazon, is not a conversation about heraldry, and is not related to any heraldry article. The fact that an image could be considered an accurate depiction of what is outlined in a blazon is 100% irrelevant here. We are talking about a very specific corporate symbol, which by definition to be the Queen's personal representative symbol, must approved by her (both the design and image). 
::::::::2. The fact that the 1957 Arms are no longer used by the Sovereign is not a reason to exclude them in favour of the user-rendition, as after all, the user-rendition is most certainly not used by the sovereign either. So, your statement that they are not "used by the sovereign and so shouldn't be in the infobox" absolutely applies to the user-rendition.
::::::::3. When you say you'd "rather see an accurate 'unofficial' depiction of the arms" you are saying that you would rather see something used which in fact is not the specific corporate symbol at all, but instead is a hobbyists caricature. And as an aside, if the user-derivative was not caricature but in fact was "accurate", it would then fall under "Marks and designs '''similar to the official symbols are pursued as a copyright''' or trade-mark '''infringement'''" ([http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Government of Canada]). IF it truly was accurate enough to be used, it would fall under Crown Copyright and not be allowed here. If it is not accurate enough, then it shouldn't be used on this article at all. 

::::::::At least the 1957 version is actually the symbol in question as approved by the Sovereign (of which this article is about), because as you say 'arms not used by the Sovereign shouldn't be in the infobox'. The 1957 Arms were used for 37 years, and were approved by the topic of this article to be used as a specific symbol to represent the topic of this article in question. The user-generated rendition was not, and never has been. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 18:24, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::The blazon is relevant if we're going to talk about accuracy. The user-created image follows the blazon. The 1957 version does not. I think I've been clear enough: an accurate but "unofficial" version of the arms in use is superior to an "official" version of arms no longer used.
:::::::::If you wish to continue pushing for the change, it seems clear we're going to have to move to [[WP:3O]], as neither of us is going to convince the other and there's no compromise other than no arms at all (which I think neither of us want) or the one reached earlier but you find unacceptable. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 22:09, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::How is the blazon relevant? I'm not talking about heraldic practices, but a specific ''image''. One image is different than the other. One represents the Sovereign of Canada (as they personally signed the image making it so), and the other doesn't. One has been used to represent the topic of this article, and the other has not. One is professional, the other is not. 
::::::::::You haven't addressed any of the issues in points 1 through 3 above, merely brought up a non-relevant textual description once again, which no one is disputing or even talking about. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 23:35, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:::::::::::This argument has been rehashed a hundred times, particularly at [[Talk:Canada]]; some people say if the image follows the blazon, it is a proper representation of the arms of Canada, while others say only the version created by the Heraldic Authority and approved by the monarch are the arms of Canada. I'm not going to deny the "official" version is a better rendition; but, I don't hold that we can ''only'' use that version to illustrate the Canadian coat of arms, especially given there's no alternative allowable in Wikipedia (outside the article on the arms itself). The note below the image in this article's infobox suffices to let readers know it isn't an "official" depiction of the arms.
:::::::::::On top of that, the 1957 arms are not used any more and that is reason enough not to have them in the infobox as though they are the monarch's coat of arms. That's all that needs to be said on the use of that version.
:::::::::::Perhaps you can come up with a fair use argument for the copyrighted image in this article. Otherwise, it really does appear there's two options: drop the matter or proceed to [[WP:3O]]. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 23:48, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::::The statement that "if the image follows the blazon, it is a proper representation of the arms of Canada" is correct, if we were talking about heraldic practice and what is 'good to go' in accordance with rules of heraldry, which we are not. We are talking about the two symbols authorized by the state and shown in the "Technical Specifications" section of the Federal Identity Program, ie two very specific approved images. Not the finer points of heraldry. So, ''this'' argument is not a rehash of arguments about what is heraldically correct, it is a completely separate debate: what is the best symbol to represent the topic of this article is the issue at hand. Which is why any mention of a blazon is irrelevant. 
{{outdent}}This would really go a lot easier if you actually addressed the points brought forward instead of pushing for 3-O. 
#If the fact that "the 1957 arms are not used any more and that is reason enough not to have them in the infobox as though they are the monarch's coat of arms" is true, then it is equally true for the user-rendition, as the user-rendition 'has never been used and that is reason enough not to have them in the infobox as though they are monarch's coat of arms'. Except that the 1957 Arms ''are'' still in use (point 4 below). 
#If the user-rendition is in fact accurate enough to be used instead of the Arms, it would then fall under the Government of Canada clause that "Marks and designs '''similar to the official symbols are pursued as a copyright''' or trade-mark '''infringement'''" ([http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Government of Canada]), making the user-rendition a copyright violation under Canadian law. If the user-rendition is not accurate enough, then it shouldn't be used on this article at all.
# You agree that "the 'official' version is a better rendition", so why don't we use it? You've already accepted the use of an image which was never used to represent the topic at hand, so why not simply use the "better rendition", especially as it is an approved symbol still in use and is actually used to represent the topic in question, as...
# The 1957 version of the Arms ''are'' still in use, see the [http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Government of Canada Official Symbols] page, the 1957 Arms are still an official symbol of the Canadian State (bottom left of Figure T-105 of the Federal Identity Program). The "revised 1957" Arms were in use on the covers of passports until 2002, and  on cases of the Canadian Forces Decoration [http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/pub/cfd-dfc-eng.asp#cha-5 until 2005] even though the now most commonly used version was approved in 1994. The 1957 version is still in use in the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP as a badge of authority, and perhaps elsewhere as well. The "revised 1994" version never superseded the 1957 version, but was used along side of it, as is still the case today.

::You realize the 1957 version ''is'' one of the two official versions still in use right? And you have not explicitly addressed any of the four points addressed above, but have only deflected by referring to an irrelevant blazon, deflected by advocating for 3-O instead of addressing the points, and refuse to acknowledge that the 1957 Arms are in fact still in current use to symbolically represent the topic of this article. 
::You've freely admitted that "the 'official' version is a better rendition". The 1957 ''and'' 1994 revisions are the only two official images in current use. The latter cannot be used, but the former can, therefore the 1957 version is the only actual image of Arms of the Queen of Canada that can be used here. You have also stated that it "is reason enough not to have them [the Arms] in the infobox as though they are the monarch's coat of arms", which the 1957 Arms ''are'' the monarch's coat of arms and ''are'' in current use, but the user rendition is not, and never has been.

::::It is still used by certain federal agencies, as above, and as per the Arms parent article.

Yes, it has been gradually replaced by the 1994 Arms over time, like the passport in 2002 and Canadian Forces decoration in 2005, however it has not been completely replaced in all agencies, and most importantly, ''the 1957 Arms are still maintained as an official symbol by the Government of Canada'' (unlike the 1921 Arms), and is still legally protected as such as you can see by the refs above.

::::::Yes, it is still in current use. Why do you refuse to acknowledge all the evidence brought forward? Every branch of service in the Canadian Armed Forces just completed amending rank insignia, which ''continue to use the 1957 Arms'' to represent the Queen of Canada's granting of Royal Warrants, as does the RCMP. Second, the 1957 Arms are still an official symbol of the Canadian state, as I've shown you multiple times through reliable sources. There is no proof of the 1957 Arms ever being superseded, in fact there is much proof to the contrary. So far you have simply ignored the links and evidence, and have continued based on nothing but your personal opinion, even in contradiction to your own stated preferences for the official rendering. The only reason for the user-rendition you have brought forward is that the 1957 Arms are no longer in use, which has been proven false, and even if it were true that is not a logical reason for the use of this user-rendition image, as that image has never been in use at all, which by your own logic means that the version you keep putting up should not be used. 
::::::In summary, you have not addressed a single point brought forward for the use of the actual Arms, and you have not brought forward a single point for the use of the user-rendition. The only two points you have actually brought forward is in support of the 1957 Arms, making it all the more mystifying why you insist on using an inferior image (which you've already admitted) which has no connection to the subject matter as it was never used by the Canadian monarchy (a point which you say means that it cannot be used here).

:::[[User:Moxy|Moxy]] is using the word "''fake''" in the sense of "''a specific image which has never been approved and adopted by Canada as an official legal symbol representing the nation or the state yet still appears as such''", ie an image of the Canadian flag or the Canadian arms which are not, in fact, the "real" (meaning "legally approved and adopted by Canada") flag or arms of Canada. The fact that you had trouble distinguishing the two is proof that the "fake" image, as defined above, is "similar" and "so nearly resembling as to be likely be mistaken for" the actual copyrighted image, which is to say is then [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Trackratte/Canadian_Crown_Prerogative_Copyright#Original_and_Derivative_Works a copyright violation under Canadian and American law].

'''To note''': In order to be ''the'' actual Arms or Flag of Canada, the image itself, in addition to the text, must be personally signed and approved by the Queen of Canada, as you can see in the top left corner of the image below. Both "Canadian flags" are heraldically correct as they both perfectly correspond to the blazon ([http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=462&ProjectElementID=1556"Gules on a Canadian pale Argent a maple leaf Gules"]). However, as we can plainly see, the flag above right is ''not'' the National Flag of Canada and cannot be portrayed as such in an Encyclopedia in the same way as the Arms. Whether or not an image is correct in terms of the principles of heraldry and conforms to a blazon is entirely irrelevant when it comes to specific national or state symbols. The symbol itself is a very specific and exact legal image. Further, any "Marks and designs ''similar'' to the official symbols are pursued as a ''copyright'' or trade-mark infringement",[http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp] and where "No person shall adopt...any mark...so nearly resembling as to be likely to be mistaken for...the arms, crest or flag adopted and used at any time by Canada",[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/page-3.html#docCont],  which is simply to say that any user-rendition of a coyprighted image that is "similar" and "so nearly resembling as to be likely be mistaken for" the actual copyrighted image is a copyright violation under Canadian law, ie if the 1994 Arms are copyrighted, similar user-renditions of these Arms are equally copyright violations, however the 1957 revision is both considered free-use by Commons and is also still currently an [http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp official symbol of Canada], making it the only suitable Canadian state symbol available for use on Wikipedia (as there are only two "real" state symbols, one is copyrighted the other is not, and any similar rendition of the copyrighted image is both "fake" and a copyvio under Canadian law).

This applies to any image that shows the Royal Crown, in which case the [http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/agency-agence/herald-armoiries-eng.html "personal approval of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II"] is required. Which is the same practice in the UK, as can be seen [http://www.policememorial.org.uk/uploads/images/trust_badge_signed-web.png here], and [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A8YPaLpCcAA8ERi.jpg here], as well as in New Zealand as can be seen [http://gg.govt.nz/sites/all/files/images/001%20(859x1280).jpg here]. As you can see, each time, a very specific image/rendering created by a professional herald is legally approved for use and adoption at any given time, and any other rendering not legally adopted and approved is simply not the symbol in question. Any revisions to an already approved image must be personally approved again by the Queen prior to being adopted for use, as can be seen with this [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=461&ProjectImageID=1151 2005 registration] which explicitly states that the newly revised rendering of a previously approved symbol was legally approved by the Queen of Canada in 1994, although they don't show a copy of the signed 1994 document itself, but examples can be seen at the links above. So, as we can see in the centre of the legal letters patent for the National Flag of Canada shown, there is only one specific National Flag of Canada image or rendering, and as we just saw, any revised rendering of the Flag image would have to be formally approved by the Queen of Canada prior to then becoming the new National Flag of Canada, and as we can see above right in the table any alternate renderings of the specific symbol, although correct in terms of heraldry, are simply not the National Flag of Canada and the same applies to the Arms.

:From a place  situated not far from the Queen's London residence, I previously agreed with comments reiterated above by Mies.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Monarchy_of_Canada/Archive_9] (in a discussion opened by track. a year ago) and I see nothing in the above which alters that. The proposal to display the arms of 1957 by asserting that a representation of the current blazon is not identical with an image representing the "official" copyrighted version looks more emotive than rational (which is sometimes desirable, but not here), even if external sources calling it "cartoonish" were produced. If choice were not inhibited by copyright, obviously the copy of the  "official" represenation would be preferred.

::What is your argument against using the official Arms of Canada as revised in 1957? Or are you agreeing that they should be used?
::Your characterization of the argument is not one that I am advancing, so unless you're setting up a strawman, I suggest you review the argument. To make it easier, the Flag and Arms are specific images approved and adopted by the state, an encyclopedia should not use a flag or arms to represent a country that are not in fact the symbol in question, such as the flag above right, or [http://egotvonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/800px-US_51-star_alternate_flag.svg_-600x315.png this rendition of the American flag] to represent the U.S., even though it is actually more in line with the [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us)coa.html blazon of the Arms] on which the canton is based. The user-rendition image is actually irrelevant to the argument, only the actual Arms should be used, just as only the actual American Flag should be used, just as the actual National Flag of Canada should be used. 

::And what has changed since the former discussion you bring up, is proof that specific renderings are approved by the Canadian state individually, so any rendering which has not been approved are not, in fact, the symbol in question, as you can plainly see from the rendering of the National Flag of Canada above right. In addition, revised renderings also must be similarly approved by the Canadian state as can been seen above. Second, the 1957 official rendering is still an official symbol of Canada maintained by the state, as you can see in the source above, and is still in current (although sharply diminished) use, once again as can be seen above. Third, there is no evidence that the 1957 Arms were ever superceded, as can be seen by the Government maintaining both the 1957 and 1994 revisions as official symbols concurrently today, and by the fact that Canadian passports and certain decorations still used the 1957 version of the Arms well into the mid-2000s, showing once again that the 1994 revision did not supercede the 1957 one, but that they were both in fact used concurrently, a state which is still ongoing today as can be seen most recently with the CAF's redoing of all three services insignia using the 1957 Arms published just three months ago.

:::: The comment is at 10:55 am yesterday, different time settings. The following pertinent points haven't been responded to at all:
::::# Where is your proof that the 1957 Arms are not currently an official symbol of Canada? The [http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Government of Canada says they are]. And the article you refer to says that both the 1957 and 1994 revised Arms are official symbols of Canada. Thus far all you have done is contradict legal sources using nothing but your own opinion, and have removed this current Canadian official symbol seven times now. You have failed to address this point, simply ignoring the sources and proceeding on continual reversion based on your own unsourced opinion.
::::# Second, you state that consensus was achieved ''not'' to use the 1957 Arms, where is this consensus located? Because I'm not aware of it. You have not addressed this point.
::::# Third, whether or not the 1957 Arms are currently in use, which sources prove they are, is entirely irrelevant to the current discussion, as the image you keep inserting has ''never'' been used by Canada. If the reason you keep removing the 1957 Arms is because this image is not in current use, then by your own logic, you should be removing Arms which are most certainly not in current use (the user-rendition) as they have in fact never once been approved nor adopted by Canada. You have so far failed to address this point at all.
::::# Fourth, according to American and Copyright law (linked above), any image derived from a copyrighted image is a copyright violation. Thus, the image you keep on inserting is not suitable inline with policy (or law). And it is clear it is a derivative and not based ''solely'' on the blazon, as it copies elements from the copyrighted image not present at all in the blazon, such as the maple leaf mantle, maple leaf on the gorge of the helm, the green colouring of the inside of the helm, etc, etc. You have not addressed this point either. 
::::# Fifth, how is it acceptable to use the flag above right on the Canada page for example? As using the Arms above right here is the exact same thing. 
::::# So finally, why not use an official symbol of the Canadian monarchy to represent the article on the Canadian monarchy? The 1957 image was approved by the Canadian monarch to represent it, the user-rendition was not. The 1957 image is currently used and maintained as an official symbol of Canada, the user-rendition is not (and this point is proven by sources). The 1957 image has the advantage of being non-offensive (in the same way as using the Flag above right would be offensive, regardless of heraldic accuracy), is an official and legal symbol of the Canadian monarchy, is currently an official symbol of Canada, and as such is a professional image made by a national expert and professional herald, and is free-use. The user-rendition has none of these advantages, and instead has all of the reverse disadvantages, primary of which not being the actual Arms of Canada approved and adopted by Canada.

:I think all involved would prefer the most recent and commonly used revised 1994 Arms, however an admin ruled that it can only be used at the Arms of Canada page. However, as we can see, I think all the editors involved so far here feel that it should be allowed here as well, as it is the direct and most commonly used symbol of the Monarchy of Canada in all capacities (legislative, executive, and judicial). However, all I'm saying is that the 1957 Arms represent a good second choice (and as the current first choice is not allowed unless someone changes it, is the best choice left available), as the 1957 revision ''were'' the most commonly used symbol, were legally approved for use by Canada, are ''still'' officially used to some extent, and are ''still'' legally an official symbol of Canada (so are thus still a "real depiction" in the sense of having been "approved and adopted for use by Canada"). I think no Arms at all would be a disservice as they've been here since 2007, and are the best image as the direct symbol of the article topic, but getting rid of them altogether would be my third choice.

:::Actually Wikipedia does allow copyrighted images under a "Free Use" justification, as can be seen for the 1994 Arms at the Arms of Canada page.

However, a user reverted it based on [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2013 July 31|this discussion here]]. It would be my hope that this decision could be revisited for this article specifically, as the admin's judgement, while perhaps applying to the other articles regarding the argument about the blazon, that argument does not apply here, in the same way you cannot use an "alternative version" of the Canadian flag (such as above right in the table above) in the [[Canada]] article.

Does the monarch of Canada currently possess, in the federal jurisdiction, one (by 1994 blazon) or two (by 1957 and 1994 blazons) coats of arms, or is there one set of arms with two different versions? 01:29, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

* '''One'''--the arms according to the blazon from 1994 onward. The 1957 arms were superseded by the 1994 arms; though the 1957 version may still appear on old documents and in older courts, they are not the current arms of the monarch of Canada. The appearance of the 1957 version of the arms on Canadian Forces epaulets does not mean the 1957 arms are currently the arms of the sovereign, nor does the fact the 1957 version is under Crown copyright. Further, there cannot be two concurrent versions of the same arms: saying the contrary requires arbitrarily excluding the 1923, 1921, 1905, and 1868 versions of the arms. There is one version of the arms representing the monarch at one time, and presently it is the version created in 1994. Any claim the monarch is represented by more than one set of arms or the monarch presently uses two versions of one set of arms to represent herself requires a reliable source saying so, not [[WP:OR|original research]]. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 01:29, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

It is original research to say a source shows the 1957 arms as a symbol of the Government of Canada and the constitution says the government is the Queen acting on the advice of the Privy Council, so the 1957 arms are a symbol of the Queen.

However, the annulet is not a '''required''' component of the arms (unlike the escutcheon, crest, and supporters), therefore the continued use of components of Her Majesty's Canadian Government and the Canadian Forces to use the arms without the annulet does not mean that there are two sets of arms. Also, while the arms of each province and territory are not recorded as the "Arms and Supporters of Her Majesty The Queen in Right of ''(insert name of province/territory here)''," the practical use is the same; they represent her authority as Sovereign over the province/territory. —&nbsp;[[User:Jkudlick|Jkudlick]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[User_talk:Jkudlick|t]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Jkudlick|c]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[User:Jkudlick/sandbox|s]] 23:34, 21 March 2016 (UTC)

According to [https://books.google.ca/books?id=4f_dQFXQpVkC&dq=augmentations+do+not+change+coats+of+arms&source=gbs_navlinks_s Christopher McCreery] all members of the Order of Canada have the right to augment their arms with the circlet of of the Order, which was done for the Sovereign. However, if one were to be removed from the Order, such as recently happened to Conrad Black, he would have had to remove the augmentation from his arms if he had had any. 
::[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23186/23186-h/23186-h.htm#chapXIII Chapter 8 of this handbook] says that augmentation is a form of differencing, similar to abatements which are marks of dishonour on ones arms. The [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/augmentation dictionary defines] it as "an addition to a coat of arms granted as a mark of special honor", which then means it could just as easily be removed by the sovereign. This [https://scaheraldry.wikispaces.com/Augmentation+of+Arms random site] says "An augmentation is not registered as a change of armory; instead, both the underlying arms and the arms with augmentation are protected. Therefore, the underlying armory can be changed while keeping the augmentation the same (assuming no style problems result).

The blazon will rarely state that there is an augmentation; some augmentations are added to the escutcheon and are merely stated in blazon, while others include the annulet for an Order and are usually not included in the blazon (e.g., see [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=929&ShowAll=1 the arms of Her Excellency Michaël Jean], which does not specify the annulet in the blazon despite the fact that as a former Governor General, Mme. Jean is an extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada). The reason the blazon for HM's arms specifically include the annulet is because any changes to the Royal Arms must be approved by HM; therefore, unless there is a public announcement that the annulet is approved, it should not be used even though she is Sovereign of the Order of Canada.

==='''Questions/Comments''' ===
# What is the goal of this RfC in reference to the mainspace? 
# It is quite clear the Queen of Canada has more than one Coat of Arms, the Canadian Monarchy has [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|14 or more of coats of arms]] including all of the Provinces and Territories, so it seems an extremely odd stance to take in saying that she cannot have more than one set of Arms, as she quite clearly can and does. ''Miesianiacal has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Monarchy_of_Canada&diff=next&oldid=710453557 since changed the RfC question] to only encompass the "federal jurisdiction". However, quite clearly Miesianiacal's assertion the "There is [only] one version of the arms representing the monarch at one time" is false. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 02:27, 17 March 2016 (UTC) ''
# The Government of Canada specifically maintains a legal set of [http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Six Official Symbols], which are "Figure T-105: <u>Official government symbols: Arms of Canada as revised in 1994</u>, Government of Canada signature, Canada Wordmark, <u>Arms of Canada as designed in 1921 and revised in 1957</u>, flag symbol, and federal emblem used from 1974 to 1987", so as we can see the 1957 Arms are still an Official Symbol of Canada, with the diagrams at the link. We can also see that they clearly note when a symbol ceased to be used in the "federal emblem used from 1974 to 1987" statement, however there is no similar 'arms of Canada from 1957 to 1994' statement, as the emblem is in fact, still in use. 
# Speaking of [[WP:OR]], Miesianiacal hasn't presented a single source to back up their opinions that the Queen cannot have more than one coat of arms, nor that that the 1957 Arms were ever superceded. 
# As you can see at the [[Canadian passport#Gallery|Canadian Passport Gallery]], all Canadian passports used the 1957 Arms until roughly 2003, nearly a decade after Miesianiacal thinks they were superceded, so either the Government of Canada was in error for a decade, or the above editor's unsubstantiated opinion is ill-placed.  
# The Canadian Forces Decoration used the 1957 Arms [http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/pub/cfd-dfc-eng.asp#cha-5 until roughly 2005], once again, either the Government of Canada was wrong for over a decade, or the above editor is mistaken. 
# The Canadian Armed Forces, having just [http://www.forces.gc.ca/assets/FORCES_Internet/docs/en/honours-history-badges-colours-flags/insignia-poster.pdf published this structure three months ago], still uses the 1957 Arms to represent the Queen's authority (those who wear that badge receive the Queen's Warrant). 
# The RCMP [http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/unif/badge-insigne-eng.htm#ranknonofficers still use the 1957 Arms] as a badge of the Queen's authority in recieving the Queen's Warrant in the same way. 
# As we can clearly see in the [http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/spec/100/T105-eng.asp Government of Canada official symbols page], the 1921, 1923 or whatever other versions that were brought forward above are not, or no longer, official symbols of Canada, so their being brought up here is entirely irrelevant. However the 1957 Arms are quite clearly stated as currently being an official symbol of Canada. 
# Canadian Courts make no mention of the Arms being superseded in 1994, but however refer to [http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/unif/badge-insigne-eng.htm#ranknonofficers both the 1957 and 1994 version as simply the Arms of Canada]: "Finally, on July 12, 1994, Her Majesty the Queen approved certain changes, one of which was to add the motto of the Order of Canada...The Arms of Canada are used on federal government possessions such as [[:File:Coats of arms of Canada on Currie Hall Mackenzie Building Royal Military College of Canada.JPG|buildings]] [1957 and 1994 revisions], official seals, money, passports, proclamations and publications [revised 1994 version]. They are also reproduced on the rank badges of some members of the Canadian Forces [revised 1957 version]." 
# It is unclear to me what the point of this RfC is, as there is no discussion of ''all'' the Queen's Arms at this page, nor does it delve into the distinction between the 1957 and 1994 version of the Arms, nor into the topic of the possibility of the Queen having more than one set of Arms, so seems largely irrelevant. Unless this is an attempt to address the [[Talk:Monarchy of Canada#Break|above topic]] in a roundabout way? In which case a new RfC would need to be started as this RfC doesn't address the issue of the infobox at all, nor is the infobox question about whether or not the Queen has multiple coats of arms. 
:: So while the Queen most certainly did "approve certain changes" in 1994, the 1957 symbol was not simply discontinued in 1994, but carried on being used for decades, and to this day is still maintain as an Official Symbol of Canada and legally protected as such by the Government of Canada, and is still used today by certain state agencies to represent the Queen's authority. Yes, the 1957 version has been gradually replaced by the 1994 version (such as passports in 2003), but they clearly continued to be used after 1994, and are still clearly maintained today, although less and less. Presumably, one day they will be removed from official use like the 1923 Arms were, however that day has most clearly not yet arrived. 
:* So the question isn't "Can the Queen have multiple Arms" (the answer is clearly yes, she has at least 14, not including other derivatives such as seals or badges), but instead is really "''are the revised 1957 Arms used as a symbol to represent the Canadian state?''" --> As we can see above, 1) the Government of Canada's statement is clear that the 1957 Arms are legally one of the current official symbols of Canada, 2) the Arms were continued in official use post-1994 on Canadian passports, awards, decorations, and elsewhere, and 3) the Arms continue to be used to represent the authority of the state in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Armed Forces (two state agencies), and perhaps elsewhere as well, all of which ''resoundingly points to the answer that yes, this symbol has been and still is used to represent the Canadian [[The Crown|state]]''.

* '''Question''' - Wouldn't an updated set of arms supersede any previous? Just like a flag, you set the old design away with all respect, but you hoist the new one up the flagpole. Surely this is the same sort of thing? --[[User:Skyring|Pete]] ([[User talk:Skyring|talk]]) 16:28, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
::Good question, as that assumption is really the core of the proposal I think, and I admit, as a simple assumption makes sense. However, as we can see when we delve into the actual reliable sources above, the Arms were not superseded as soon as the newest rendition was approved, but continued to represent the state on passports, etc for over a decade, and by virtue of the 1957 image still being legally maintained as an Official Symbol of Canada today according to current state documents. We haven't seen any evidence that the Arms were superseded or officially "removed from service", but instead a great deal of reliable evidence pointing instead to the contrary. Even ''if'' we didn't have the three official reliable sources above showing their continued use today, we would still know (via the passport amongst others) that the Arms continued to be used for well over a decade, so it would then still be unclear exactly what date they were superseded, as it certainly wasn't in 1994. And as for the actual RfC question itself, whether there are two sets of Arms or one set of Arms with two versions, I don't really see what difference any such distinction would make, as either way both images are still Official Symbols of Canada. Unless we reason that the Canadian state is wrong about their own official symbols, but that is like person 'A' telling person 'B' that they have been pronouncing their own name incorrectly their entire lives. Which is to say, if the Canadian state is wrong about its own chosen official symbols, who could then possibly be right?

::I believe that is the case, though I don't have at hand a source saying so. I'm speaking in the context of the government, of course; what arms appear on official government documents, websites, and the like; none made after 1994 use the 1957 arms. The military and RCMP have their own policies on uniform design.

:::No, but the Arms of Canada are. Specifically the Arms represent the bestowing of the Queen's Warrant to those who wear it, and thus the exercise of the Queen's authority. CWOs wear commissioned (Queen's commission) officers' accoutrements as a result. The RCMP and the military have not had the authority to govern their own badges since the establishment of the Canadian Heraldic Authority. In the military's case (and I assume similar for the RCMP), things like badges which use the Arms or the Royal Crown are staffed through DHH to Rideau Hall for approval by the Sovereign. Six examples of this, the Queen signing "Approved. Elizabeth II" on the image proposals, are located in the section above.

:::::::::::::::And you can portray a 2 v. 2 argument as "consensus" all you want, that simply does not make it so. And looking at the actions today here and at [[File talk:Coat of arms of Canada.svg]], there are obviously several editors unhappy with the use of the user-made creative interpretation, and the current consensus is clearly in favour of the official symbol. By my count, I see you, me, GoodDay, Moxy, JKudlic, and Bushel in favour of the official symbol over that of the creative user-made interpretation, and zero people advocating against the official symbol. The "consensus" you are citing is ''only'' that whenever an unofficial rendition is shown it must make it clear that it is an unofficial rendition, ''not'' that it is the best, most suitable, or should be used symbol here or anywhere. This kerfuffle is based on your denial that the unaugmented official arms are somehow not official, against all sources to the contrary, which baffles me as even if your argument were true, the user-rendition is certainly ''not'' official, so by your own argument should not be used. Anyways, despite my being opposed to your argument regarding the unaugmented official arms (or actually I'm in favour of your argument as your argument is really that the official arms should be used, I just disagree with your refusal to recognise the government of Canada's explicit list of what those symbols are) we are clearly both in agreement on what actual image should be used here. I suggest we stop bickering about what our second, third, or fourth choice should be, and focus on working together on what our first choice both is, a choice which so happens to currently have unanimous consensus behind. If this current (unanimous) consensus cannot be implemented, then we can revist the matter through a clear RfC regarding which image (or none at all) should be used in the infobox here in the absence of the augmented official 1994 image not being available for use. [[User:Trackratte|trackratte]] ([[User talk:Trackratte|talk]]) 15:59, 22 March 2016 (UTC)  
::::::::::::::::This is indeed a pointless argument. The user-created image with the caption has been there for months now; regardless of the consensus reached during the last go-around with this, what's there also has consensus by silence. You have the right to make a change, but, so, too, does anyone else have the right to revert it, per [[WP:BRD]], and the status-quo remains until a consensus, if any, is established favouring a change. And here you  are trying to form that consensus. So, why a past debate is so important to you, I have no idea. There are other, current matters to attend to.
::::::::::::::::Now, of course I prefer the CHA's rendering of the arms. But, most of this discussion (as well as all of the last one) was centred on finding a way to include the arms ''with the belief the CHA's version was absolutely inadmissible''. We've always been looking for the last-worst alternative to the CHA's rendition. It seems this time focus is shifting to the restrictions on the use of the CHA's depiction of the arms.

:::::::::::::::::The past debate is not "so important" to me, the only reason it has been brought up is because you used it as your justification to put the user-image into the article seven times against four or more objectors. And it's a bit of a bizarre situation as the image wasn't changed due to consensus, but due to an admin's decision yanking it out. And don't cite [[WP:BRD]] as you're the one to revert four different people on seven occasions, and now the page is protected, so I think we're passed that. There is obviously no consensus by silence, [[WP:SMN|if such a thing even exists]], as it has been contested multiple times now since the appropriate image was forcibly removed against the wishes of all those involved.

:I've said all along that the most suitable way forward is to use the actual 1994 COA image, all we've debated about the image is whether we should go with the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th option, and since absolutely everyone actually supports the first option, essentially amounts to a debate over which option we think is least bad, not which one is best. 
:I already emailed the Government of Canada Crown Copyright Office a couple years ago and had posted their response at Commons. Their stance is obviously that the image isn't fair use and that "no renditions of the Arms of Canada are released into the public domain" (which includes the revised 1957 image, but that's a separate issue). From my understanding we don't need specific permission to use the revised 1994 image here, as we clearly already do under fair-use policy. Although I suppose an email stating that their stance is that the image may be used for the specific purpose of this article could not hurt. Regardless, the closing admin's conclusion from three years ago is slightly flawed in that according to the close's logic if the flag of Canada were copyrighted, it would only be allowed in the Flag of Canada article and be barred for use at the Canada article, leaving us with the conclusion that it is perfectly acceptable to use [[:File:Flag of Canada (1964).svg|this flag]] to represent Canada throughout the entire Encyclopedia, which is clearly unacceptable and against the consensus from three years ago (which Alanscott summed up as "the consensus was that there is no other official rendering of the AOC...also that whenever the Pedia represents the AOC pictorially, it should use the official rendering").

:::I agree with your second and third paragraphs.  Disputes about when the King of England/Great Britain/UK became the King of Canada or whether French rule should be considered are too complex for the info-box.  I have not seen any arguments that the succession laws are part of Canadian law, other than the arguments against the Canadian approach to the Perth Agreement.  Can you cite any?  I think they argued that the succession laws were imperial laws that were received into Canadian law and because they related to the office of the monarch required a constitutional amendment to change.  But the courts decided that domestic law was that the British monarch would be the monarch of Canada.

::The Canadian government includes it.  It is relevant because Canada was ceded to the King by France, hence there is continuity between the different crowns.  When George III became King of Canada, he did so as the successor to Louis XV.  To Canadians, the only initial change was the person who was king.  There was no change to the office.  Any law or contract written before the conquest that referred to the king would be read as referring to the British king rather than the French king.

== Peter Boyce's observation ==

Though I agree with Boyce, I'm neutral on whether we should or shouldn't mention his observations about the Perth Agreement, in this article. I do however recommend, that ya'll discuss inclusion/exclusion here, rather then have a slow-edit war. [[User:GoodDay|GoodDay]] ([[User talk:GoodDay|talk]]) 00:03, 11 June 2017 (UTC)

:The reason for excluding Boyce (he is an Australian constitutional scholar) does not make sense.  This article is skewed toward a viewpoint that the Queen of Canada is as separate from the Queen of the UK as the King of Great Britain was once separate from the Elector of Hanover.  Note that the comment in the article that the Statute of Westminster 1931 disallowed the UK from legislating in relation to succession in Canada is false.  Whoever is sovereign in the UK is sovereign in Canada.  Whether or not we quote Boyce, we need to reflect current mainstream opinion.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 00:22, 11 June 2017 (UTC)
::I think first of all it is relevant to the Canadian monarchy as the Canadian monarchy is one of the monarchies he is explicitly talking about (his book's title is ''The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and Its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand'' and it is already cited in this article several times so clearly it has been accepted that his observations apply to the Monarchy of Canada. Secondly, the relevance of this quotation to Canada has been recognized by Canadian scholars who use the quote in the article "If the Queen Has No Reserve Powers Left, What Is the Modern Monarchy For?" published in the Canadian academic journal ''Review of Constitutional Studies/Revue d'études constitutionelles'' [https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/images/PDFs/02_Hazell-Morris.pdf the article can be found here]. Thirdly, I think inclusion of the quote is needed for balance/NPOV reasons as it differs from the arguments that predominate in the article that claim the Canadian monarchy is equal to the British monarchy rather than subordinate. It has been removed because it is claimed it is "not relevant" to the page. I've provided supporting evidence that it is. As for <s>TFD's</s> the claim that he should be excluded because he is an Australian scholar, that is irrelevant and that has been shown by the fact that he is ''already'' widely quoted in this article and by the fact that Canadian scholars quote him. Indeed, there are a number of non-Canadian scholars quoted here, it's never been a problem before (not even, as I've mentioned, in the case of Boyce himself).

:::It doesn't belong here because it's an opinion about the project to change the succession rules and the realms in general, not just about Canada, specifically. Hence, the opinion has been moved to [[Perth Agreement]]. There may be a place for it at [[Commonwealth realm]]; I'm not sure. It is also a fringe opinion.

{{outdent}}His comment, that the Canadian crown is "derivative, if not subordinate" is the current opinion of the Canadian government and courts.  If you remember, some people thought that succession in Canada was determined by the Succession Act, which as imperial law had been received into Canadian law and had to be amended, either by federal statute or constitutional amendment.  But that turned out to be incorrect, since Canada's sovereign is whoever is king or queen of the UK, hence the Canadian crown is "derivative, if not subordinate."

It is the Canadian scholars Hazell and Morris who refer to Perth on [https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/images/PDFs/02_Hazell-Morris.pdf page 18] of their journal article ie that Boyce's view was borne out by the fact that the Perth Agreement was the result of an initiative by the British government of David Cameron.

:According to constitutional scholar Peter Boyce in ''The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and Its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand'', the fact that the change in the succession was initiated by the United Kingdom government is a reminder to the Commonwealth realms that "their crown is derivative, if not subordinate” to the crown of the United Kingdom.([https://books.google.ca/books?id=kY-Tk0-quyoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=%22if%20not%20subordinate%22&f=false source 1])[https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/images/PDFs/02_Hazell-Morris.pdf source 2 (page 18)].

===Survey===
* As the mover I am obviously in '''support'''. My arguments in favour have been extensively made [[Talk:Monarchy_of_Canada#Peter_Boyce.27s_observation|in an earlier part of this Talk page]]. [[User:Hungarian Phrasebook|Hungarian Phrasebook]] ([[User talk:Hungarian Phrasebook|talk]]) 02:52, 14 June 2017 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' Firstly, it's a remark about all the non-British Commonwealth realms, not just Canada. Hence, it's already included at [[Perth Agreement]] and [[Commonwealth realm]]. If it were included here, it'd have to be added to all 14 other articles on the Commonwealth realms that aren't the UK. Secondly, it's a minority view; since the late 1920s, the majority opinion has been that the realms are all independent of one another and equal in status (see the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and dozens of sources used in this article, at [[Commonwealth realm]], and other articles). Highlighting Boyce's opinion gives it [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]; especially so if it's put into 16 articles. It's place in the aforementioned two is (more than) enough. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 03:40, 14 June 2017 (UTC)
**'''Response''' Mere inclusion is not undue weight. A section or paragraph or extensive discussion of this issue within the article is not being proposed, simply a sentence or two. Also note that besides the fact that the book in which the quote appears even has Canada in the title (''The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and Its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand''), this exact quotation from Boyce was used in the Canadian constitutional law journal ''Review of Constitutional Studies'' on page 18 of [https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/images/PDFs/02_Hazell-Morris.pdf this article] by Hazell and Morris so Canadian constitutional scholars have found it relevant to Canada. Lastly, as I argued in the discussion earlier on this page, this article is overwhelmingly reflective of the opposite view so, if anything, undue weight is being given to the so-called majority view, including this Boyce quote is thus important in the interests of balance and ensuring all reasonable views are represented. [[WP:UNDUE]] does not call for "minority views" to be entirely excluded, as Miesianiacal's citation of it implies, but just that they are not represented disproportionately and mere inclusion of this quote is not disproportionate given the overrepresentation of the "majority view" in this article. [[User:Hungarian Phrasebook|Hungarian Phrasebook]] ([[User talk:Hungarian Phrasebook|talk]]) 11:58, 14 June 2017 (UTC)
:::I didn't say inclusion gave the opinion undue weight. I said giving a view that's supported only by one person equal footing with the opposite view that's been supported by many people over many decades is giving that fringe view undue weight. Adding that fringe view to all 15 articles on Commonwealth realm monarchies other than the UK's, which would have to be done for the sake of fairness and consistency if it were to be inserted here, gives it ''far'' more coverage than it deserves.
:::Once again (and I'm not sure why I need to repeat this), Boyce's opinion is included at [[Commonwealth realm]] and [[Perth Agreement]], which puts to rest any claim his theory has been excluded. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 01:55, 15 June 2017 (UTC)
::'''Additional remark''' Further to my argument above, I'll add that Boyce's opinion on the subservience of the non-British crowns is based on one aspect of the 1936 abdication. Putting aside how other aspects of that event actually negate Boyce's conclusion (as noted by authors quoted elsewhere on this page by Hungarian Phrasebook), the application of his opinion to the changes in royal succession in 2015 is [[WP:OR|original research]]. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 14:24, 16 June 2017 (UTC)
:::'''Response''' One reason it's not original research because it's cited by Hazell and Morris in a paragraph in which they discuss Perth. "Once again (and I'm not sure why I need to repeat this), Boyce's opinion is included at [[Commonwealth realm]] and [[Perth Agreement]]," We're discussing this article and your attempt to exclude Boyce from it. And if anything, the fact that you are not challenging the inclusion of the quote there (I believe you actually added it to [[Perth Agreement]] yourself ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perth_Agreement&diff=next&oldid=784946645 diff])) is a concession that you don't really think it's a fringe argument or irrelevant to the monarchy.

*'''Include''' It is the majority view confirmed by Canadian ministers and the courts.  It is irrelevant that the same comment applies to other realms, since the Queen's role is similar in all her realms and therefore there would be overlap between all these articles.

*'''Oppose''' <u>First</u>, according to the Succession to the Throne article the change was initiated at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Perth in 2011. The fact that it was discussed prior within the UK (as it has off and on again been discussed there and in other countries) does not mean the change was ''initiated'' there, although perhaps the private member's motion provided an open to place the subject on the Heads of Government Meeting agenda. <u>Second</u>, this quote and reference applies to all of the realms equally, and we already have articles for that. It makes little sense to put in a minor details into 16+ separate articles when just one will do. <u>Third</u>, in reference to weight, it is giving undue weight even if it is just once phrase if we put it into 17 different articles. And <u>fourth</u>, "derivative" is a nebulous term so it is difficult to even understand what exactly the author means by this, although within its context its connotation seems to be that "their crowns" are somehow beholden to the British Crown. If this is the case, it is in clear contradiction to the law which has been clearly articulated in numerous court rulings. However, if the author simply means that these crowns were "derived" in the sense of "created from" then he would be correct, although that interpretation is not supported based on the context in which it is placed in my mind.

For instance see [http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-15282940 "David Cameron proposes changes to royal succession" (BBC News)], [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/12/cameron-commonwealth-royal-succession-reform "Cameron consults Commonwealth on royal succession reforms: Prime minister proposes males should no longer take precedence as heir to the crown, starting with next generation" (The Guardian)] - this despite the fact that the chair of the meeting was the Australian PM, Julia Gillard. Note that even an Australian report says [http://www.theage.com.au/national/gillard-backs-change-in-royal-succession-rule-20111024-1mgdc.html "PRIME Minister Julia Gillard has backed the British government's move to change the rule of succession to have the oldest child ascend to the throne, irrespective of gender."] So I'm afraid your claim that it wasn't initiated by the British isn't supported by the evidence.

:::"David Cameron has written to Commonwealth leaders proposing that the law be changed". Once again, the proposal was put forth in the UK by a private member, the PM put forth the proposal to the CHGM, and this proposal was ''initiated''/agreed upon/gained traction at the CHGM meeting. I suppose it depends on what your understaning of the differnce between "proposed" and "initiated" is. Either way it is of no material difference to the reasoning.

:::::Not esoteric, both definitions are within the dictionary: "imitative of the work of another person, and usually disapproved of for that reason", and "something that is based on another source". One has derogatory connotations, and one does not. However, given the context of the clause within its sentence, it appears that the author is using the former, ie the Canadian Crown, for example, is not a separate creation which evolved out of the British Crown (latter definition), but is instead imitative and thus the Succession case serves as a "reminder" that the Canadian institution is in fact led from and driven by the UK (which is a legal and constitutional fallacy). Thus, the author is wrong using the former definition, and right using the latter, however context leads me to believe he is using the former. Not entirely material however, as my major arguments are points two and three above, with points one and four being supporting or ancillary, and with discussion raised by yourself and Hungarian focusing on these ancillary points.

:The Quebec Court ruling states that " It was therefore as of 1931 that Canada and the United Kingdom had separate crowns, that is, separate heads of state, even if embodied by the same natural person", while also recognizing that Canada's ''succession law'' is simply the "rule of symmetry". You are confusing the ''mechanism of selection'' with the concept of subordination (defined: "lower in rank or position", or "a person under the authority or control of another"). Clearly the Court ruled that the two positions are separate heads of state, and one is no more subordinate over the other than the Prime Minister of Canada is to the President of Brazil. 
:The rule of symmetry is simply a mechanism of selection. For example, the [[Chief Justice of Canada]] is also Deputy to the Governor General and the Administrator of Canada, that does not mean that the office of Administrator or Deputy is subordinate to the Chief Justice. It simply means that whomever occupies one office may simultaneously and automatically be appointed to other offices as well.

:::1. Exactly my point. 2. The person filling the office of Chief Justice is automatically the administrator as well as a deputy ("The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is, ex officio, the Deputy Governor General of Canada"). The point that was made, in line with 1., is that someone occupying an office by virtue of their appointment to another office in no way means one is subordinate to the other. This often happens in the business world as well with outside directors, where a position in one company means a position in another. The logic chain underpinning Canada being "subordinate" to the UK is deeply flawed, and is also unhinged from political and legal realities. 3.

The court stated that "Just as the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 incorporates into the Canadian Constitution the principle of parliamentary privilege and not the legislative source of that privilege, so ''the rule of recognition identifying the Crown in Canada as the person who occupies the throne in the United Kingdom is also <u>incorporated into the Constitution</u>'', without the British law governing succession to the throne being incorporated".

There was a theory that the Canadian Crown was created in 1931 within its own laws of succession.  Adherents argued that if the UK changed the succession rules the changes would have no effect in Canada where succession would be governed by the original succession laws.  In theory therefore Canada could at some point have the different person on the throne from the UK.  However, the prevailing opinion today is that Canada's constitution provides for the British sovereign to be sovereign of Canada, and it is a courtesy that Canada provides its assent to any changes in succession.  Therefore, as Boyce says, the crown of Canada is subordinate to the crown of the UK.  While this article should explain the various views, currently it presents an obsolete theory as fact.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 22:17, 16 June 2017 (UTC)
:It appears to be not so simple. From the last ruling in Quebec: "As such, the rule of automatic recognition means that the Queen or King of the United Kingdom is also the Queen or King of Canada, with no need to amend Canadian law for it to be so. If Canadian Parliament disagrees with the amendments to the rules governing the succession to the throne proposed by the United Kingdom, it may refuse to give its assent." If the Canadian parliament's assent is required per the Statute of Westminster--a constitutional document in both Canada and the UK--for an amendment to the laws of succession to take place in the UK, what happens if the Canadian parliament doesn't assent? Can the UK not change its laws of succession? If the UK goes ahead and changes its laws, does the change have no effect in Canada? If whomever is sovereign of the UK automatically becomes sovereign of Canada, regardless of the Canadian parliament's assent or lack thereof, why is the assent requirement in the Statute of Westminster at all, why did the Canadian parliament give its assent to the succession bill in the UK parliament in 2015, and why do the courts in Canada raise its importance in every ruling on the subject of succession? --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 17:41, 17 June 2017 (UTC)
::The courts mention the Statute of Westminster because the plaintiffs use it as a basis for their claims.  Then the courts explain that preambles have no legislative effect and section 4 was repealed.  The government position is, according to Anne Twomey, "that succession to the Canadian Crown is, and always has been, determined by the rules of succession to the British throne."  The rules of succession, such as the 1701 Act, are not "part of Canadian law and there was therefore nothing to amend."[http://cspg-gcep.ca/pdf/the_crown_and_parliament_la_couronne_et_le_parlement_chapter_12.pdf]  I don't know why the judge said (at 109) that Parliament could refuse consent.  That's ''obiter dictum'', since Parliament did not refuse consent and probably is a reference to the decision in ''O'Donogue v Canada'', which is what the judge was discussing in the paragraph.  In O'Donohue, Rouleau J. accepted that the Succession Act was part of Canadian law and said that Canada's consent was probably required to change the succession, which was what expert opinion then was.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 06:05, 18 June 2017 (UTC)
:::The judge didn't simply mention it at 109. He mentions it again in the conclusion on the aspect: "under the preamble of this statute [of Westminster], it [the UK] must by constitutional convention obtain the assent of the other member countries of the Commonwealth" (which leads to the question of whether, in this line of thinking, it's the UK that's dependent on the other realms and not, as Boyce thinks, the other way around). And "it falls to each of these countries to give its assent or not to an amendment of the rules of succession to the throne, under its own procedure". And "The Statute of Westminster is still part of the Canadian Constitution as patriated in 1982, and its preamble provides for Canada's assent in the event of an amendment to the rules of royal succession." So, what would happen if the Canadian parliament did not assent?
:::It's also intriguing how the judge is silent on the fact that the government's request and consent given on 10 December 1936 to the Abdication Act had the effect, per S.4 of the SoW, of bringing the Abdication Act into the laws of Canada. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 07:37, 18 June 2017 (UTC)

:::::However, there is no sovereign above Britain's. So, if the UK did not get the Canadian parliament's assent to alterations in the British succession laws, what's to stop them from proceeding, anyway? At the same time, there's no sovereign above Canada's and, if the constitutional convention set in the preamble to a Canadian constitutional document requires the Canadian parliament's assent to a change in the British succession laws, and that assent is not given but the British parliament proceeds, anyway, it seems pretty clear the change in British law would be considered unconstitutional according to Canadian law (and possibly British law, as well) and therefore of no effect. If you hold the opposite view--that the Canadian parliament's assent, and therefore its opposition, is always irrelevant in the context of succession--you're arguing what everyone thinks happened in 1931 didn't happen and Canada is not a fully sovereign nation.

{{outdent}}While we cannot choose which constitutional conventions are binding, governments can, since the courts have no jurisdiction for enforcing them.  The sovereign's right to prorogue parliament btw is not a constitutional convention.  What is a constitutional convention is under which circumstances that power is exercised.  But when the Governor General prorogued Parliament several years ago, it did not matter whether or not she was breaking constitutional convention, because whatever she did would have the force of law and could not be stopped through a writ of mandamus.  Similarly when Kerr sacked Whitlam, there was no judicial remedy.

:The office of prime minister cannot simply be done away with without consequence because it is only conventional to have one. The Crown's power to prorogue or dissolve parliament is conventional; it is not spelled out in any constitutional document, yet is part of the constitutional order. The Federal Court ruled that the Crown's prerogative to dissolve parliament cannot be tampered with by mere statute; it requires a constitutional amendment. There is nothing, therefore, to say the convention requiring the Canadian parliament's assent to changes to succession laws in the UK is decorative. Everything says it has the same force as any other constitutional convention. The Quebec Superior Court said as much: "under the preamble of this statute [of Westminster], it [the UK] '''must''' by '''constitutional''' convention [all emphasis mine] obtain the assent of the other member countries of the Commonwealth".
:The preamble to the Statute of Westminster in Canada is the same as the preamble to the Statute of Westminster in the UK. If the Canadian parliament refused assent to a change is succession laws in the UK and the British parliament went ahead and made the change, anyway, that change would be, according to a Canadian court, unconstitutional. As such, one cannot say whomever is monarch of the UK is automatically monarch of Canada; not outside of normal, hereditary succession, anyway (and assuming, for the sake of argument, the preamble to the Constitution Act 1867 has any determination of succession). If it's a case of someone acceding because of legal changes, whomever becomes sovereign of the UK only becomes sovereign of Canada with the assent of the parliament of Canada, which, as the Quebec Superior Court said, is not automatic ("it falls to each of these countries to give its assent '''or not''' [emphasis mine] to an amendment of the rules of succession to the throne"; "If Canadian Parliament disagrees with the amendments to the rules governing the succession to the throne proposed by the United Kingdom, it '''may refuse''' [emphasis mine] to give its assent."). --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 06:44, 19 June 2017 (UTC)

In other words, the constitutional convention is that the UK ask Canada to agree to a change in succession but if they do not the UK law determines the next monarch anyway and he or she becomes sovereign of Canada because whoever is sovereign of the UK is sovereign in Canada.  If you want to believe that the Canadian constitutional scholars of the 1930s got it right and the courts are wrong, then fine.

If that conclusion is wrong then next time the governor general prorogues parliament you can apply to the courts for a prorogative writ to stop him or her.  However if the governor general exercises this power against constitutional convention you cannot do that because constitutional conventions are not law.  Anyway, let's not get distracted by tangential issues?  Do you agree that constitutional conventions and preambles to legislation are not law and therefore cannot determine succession although they can explain how changes to the succession ''should'' be made?

If the preamble has no legislative effect, the twisted interpretation that says the preamble decides how Canada's monarchs are selected is rendered pointless; we'd have to look elsewhere for what does have legislative effect and sets out royal succession in Canada. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 18:48, 23 June 2017 (UTC)
{{outdent}}There is a difference.  Legal opinion is that the wording of the 1867 act allows the governor general to prorogue parliament. The interpretation of statutes is not the same thing as constitutional convention.  The consequences of breaking a constitutional convention and breaking a law are different too.  The consequences of the first are poltical, the consequences of the second are legal.  If you break the law, you can go to gaol and the courts can reverse your actions.  Anyway, you have provided no sources to support your opinion.  As for preambles, we accept what sources say about them.  In interpreting legislation, it is useful to understand the intent.  For example, in ''Law, Politics and the Judicial Process'', it quoteds the Chief Justice as saying the preamble "is not a source of positive law."[https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&lpg=PA232&dq=legislation%20preamble%20canada&pg=PA216#v=onepage&q&f=false]  So it does not make the Queen the same person in the UK and Canada, but says that Parliament expects they should be the same.  That helps us understand what the term "Queen" means in other part of the act.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 21:07, 23 June 2017 (UTC)

Regarding the argument advanced by TFD and perhaps others depicting the Canadian Crown as "subordinate" to the British Crown is contradicted by the very [https://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/images/PDFs/02_Hazell-Morris.pdf reference used] by Hungarian above which started off this RfD at the outset of this discussion: "The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 required the agreement of all the realms before it could be brought into force in the UK. This was because altering the rules of royal succession to make them gender neutral meant that all the monarchies had to agree lest different rules in different realms resulted in different people as monarchs. ''The realms were free to alter their constitutions without reference to the UK, but the UK could not do so on this occasion without seeking the realms’ consent; <u>the realms were relatively freer to alter their constitutions than was the UK itself</u>. This <u>inversion of former imperial realities</u> took some people by surprise''. On the other hand, as Peter Boyce has pointed out, the fact that the initiative for change remains in the hands of the UK also reminds the realms that “their crown is derivative, if not subordinate.”

The source provided by Hungarian above itself contradicts Boyce's view, although acknowledging its existence. Boyce's view regarding 'a reminder of subordination or something near it' is also directly contradicted by British and Canadian law, political reality, and court decisions. As such, the statement itself is quite evidently both unsupported as well as abjectly fringe. Additionally, the statement that "the initiative for change remains in the hands of the UK" is also unsupported, as there is nothing preventing any realm to advance a change to the agenda of the CHOG meeting, and in fact the 2013 changes were initiated at the CHOG meeting itself and discussed by all of the realms where a consensus for changed was ascertained. While the fact that Boyce has an opinion on the matter is verifiable, that does not mean we ''must'' include it. If we do wish to include it, the opinion itself is not specifically made to Canada but to the realms, and as such any such inclusion would properly be in the Perth Agreement and/or Commonrealms article(s).

:Indeed, not only does Hungarian Phrasebook's own source say the UK is more bound by the other realms than vice-versa, the Quebec court case TFD has been pointing to suggests it, as well. As I said earlier in this thread: "The judge didn't simply mention it at 109. He mentions it again in the conclusion on the aspect: 'under the preamble of this statute [of Westminster], it [the UK] must by constitutional convention obtain the assent of the other member countries of the Commonwealth' (which leads to the question of whether, in this line of thinking, it's the UK that's dependent on the other realms and not, as Boyce thinks, the other way around)." People appear to be reading only what they want to. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 22:40, 28 June 2017 (UTC)
::As you say, it is a "constitutional convention" that the UK consult with other countries before changing the succession.  It is constitutional law that whoever the UK selects automatically is king or queen of Canada.  The difference between a convention and a law is that courts can enforce laws, they cannot enforce conventions.  So a unilateral change of succession by the UK Parliament would be binding on the UK and Canada.  Conventions are in fact frequently broken and sometimes changed.

The argument that the change would be invalid is based on a view that that there was a constitutional rule requiring the consent of the Dominion parliaments - in fact the preamble to the Statute of Westminster says that.  And while the preamble is not binding law, it says changes to succession required consent because any laws affecting the dominions required consent as recognized in the Imperial Conference of 1926.

{{ec}} To bring this discussion back a bit, I don't understand the relevance of the convention debate. The fact that all of the realms will have the separate offices of sovereign occupied by the same natural person is not convention but is legislatively codified in the 1931 Statute of Westminster, which states "it would be in accord with the ''established constitutional position of all the members'' of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that ''any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions'' as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom". And according to the ''Interpretation Act'' (Canada), "The preamble of an enactment shall be read as a part of the enactment intended to assist in explaining its purport and object", and according to the ''Interpretation Act'' (Ontario), "The preamble of an Act shall be deemed a part thereof and is intended to assist in explaining the purport and object of the Act". And from Adam Dodek's ''The Canadian Constitution'' in reference to the 1867 Constitution Act, "The preamble has served as the source of recognizing and incorporating many British constitutional principles into Canadian constitutional law". As a result, even if preambles themselves cannot generally ''create'' new laws, they can legislatively recognize already existing legal principles, and thus bring these principles into the realm of legislatively codified law. There are numerous examples of this within rulings of the Supreme Court of Canada. As such, unless the Canadian and/or British Parliaments ''repeal'' or ''alter'' the 1931 Statute (which they are free to do given Parliamentary Supremacy), the fact that the two countries must share the same natural person as their respective Sovereigns, and that the two must agree to any changes in the rules for appointing this shared person, are in fact legally binding and codified under current legislation.

:Not sure what you are saying.

::That is not what the preamble says, as can be clearly seen by the fact that I just quoted it. It says "any alteration in the law...shall hereafter require the assent...of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom", i.e. alterations to succession laws will be done by complete consensus only. 
::Second, yes the Parliament of the UK is legally obligated to follow ''all'' previous laws until those laws are changed. Parliamentary sovereignty means they have the ability to modify, delete, and create all laws regardless of the opinions or actions of previous Parliaments, not that they are above the law. Thus, until such time as a piece of legislation is lawfully changed, it applies to any and all, which is to say the basic constitutional principle of "the rule of law".
::The Statute of Westminster is a piece of legislation that incorporates a pre-existing legal principle and codifies it within legislative law. As such, the Parliament of the UK is legally bound to only achieve complete consensus before being authorized to change the rules of succession. They can exercise their Parliamentary Sovereignty by amending the Statute of Westminster 1931 in order to allow them to legislate unilateral change, but such an option has not been pursued. As such, the fact that the rules of succession are only subject to modification based on absolute consensus is a matter of British and Canadian law, and will remain so until the 1931 Statute is modified or repealed. 
::As a result, the entire discussion revolving around constitutional convention, and whether or not any given convention is enforceable in a given court is irrelevant to this discussion, as it is not one of convention, but one of very clearly articulate legislated laws.

::::As such, from preambles "the Court has inferred a number of other fundamental principles that are recognized in the United Kingdom. These include the doctrine of full faith and credit, the doctrine of paramountcy, the notion of the rule of law, the legislative privileges for Parliament and the provincial legislatures, and the interdependence between democratic governance and freedom of political speech. The Chief Justice pointed out that judicial independence is also an ''unwritten rule of Canadian constitutional law'', because the United Kingdom has a tradition of judicial independence".

:::TFD, your argument would generally be correct, and could be, as we of course do not have a specific court decision. However, as has been my position all along, I see your position as lacking sufficient nuance when it comes to the unique status of the 1931 SofW, which is to say ''generally'' preambular language is not legally binding but this is not a general case. The 1931 SofW is an exception (or more properly there are solid grounds to believe it would be seen as such by a competent legal authority), where the preamble is seen as legally binding, particularly from a Canadian point of view. For example, here is an excerpt from the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012-13 Bill No 110 2012-13 RESEARCH PAPER 12/81, House of Commons, UK (italics added for emphasis):

:::"It is sometimes suggested that the UK is obliged under the Statute of Westminster 1931 to gain the assent of the other realms before making any changes to the rules of succession,9 although this argument is perhaps overstated...The argument derives from the provision in the Preamble to the Statute of Westminster that, any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. ''In general'', preambular language does not have the binding force of the operative sections of an Act, although it may be used to assist in interpretation. The obligation may be regarded therefore as political rather than legal. ''However, the Statute of Westminster is an unusual instrument in many ways''. Few other 20th century statutes have a preamble of this kind; Parliament used the Statute to limit and relinquish its own power and sovereignty; it governed what were effectively independent states, and which became undoubtedly so in the course of using its provisions; it allowed certain of them to take up its provisions at a time and to an extent of their own choosing; and it reflected prior agreements between them which were ''akin to a treaty''. ''There is jurisprudence from Canada that asserts the need for agreement across the realms for any changes, comparing it to a treaty'', suggesting that ''in at least one realm the commitment indicated in the Preamble is regarded as binding''.1[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP12-81/RP12-81.pdf]

:::Obviously, my position is held from a Canadian point of view, and this is reflected as a valid and legally sound position within well-researched and official secondary sources. I also freely acknowledge that there are likely secondary sources corroborating your position, as it, generally applied, is valid, and I also freely acknowledge the validity of certain counter arguments.

The current opinion is that the sovereign of the UK is automatically sovereign of Canada.  The "jurisprudence from Canada" is a reference to [[O'Donohue v Canada]].

My issue is not with your position, but in completely ignoring the counter-argument (i.e. a lack of nuance in applying general principles to specific applications). 
:::::As for your second point, that also lacks nuance. The current opinion is not that the Sovereign of the UK (an office) is automatically Sovereign of Canada (a separate office), but more properly that the ''natural person'' occupying one office is automatically recognized as occupying other, separate, offices. As corporations sole, the Sovereign of Canada as a legal person has absolutely no connection or relationship with that of the Sovereign of the UK. In legal terms, the natural person does not exist, which is why Elizabeth II is not a British citizen and cannot have a passport, or why she cannot be arrested for example. However, when it comes to theoretical analysis, we separate the natural and legal persons. The natural person is shared (the rule of symmetry of succession), but the legal person is not.

{{outdent}}Your source was written in 2012 and since then experts have looked at the issue and determined that the preamble had no legislative effect.  The only source mentioned that said it did was an Ontario judge in 2003, which set no precedent.  If you want a SCC decision you will have to wait until the old and new succession laws determine that different people should ascend the throne, which is unlikely to occur.  We should accept that the opinion of the Canadian government and parliament, affirmed by the Quebec court and accepted by the UK and the other realms is the majority opinion.  There is no necessity for the SCC to determine the issue since the decision of the Quebec court is binding.

And while the natural person who is sovereign of the UK becomes sovereign of Canada, it is because they are sovereign of the UK.  The Canadian constitution recognizes the Queen of the UK as the Queen of Canada.  If the natural person abdicates as Queen of the UK, she ceases to be Queen of Canada, but not vice versa.

:You have admitted to agreeing with Bogdanor, who states that it would be ''unconstitutional for the government of the UK to unilaterally alter the rules of succession'', where according to Wikipedia the "constitution of the United Kingdom is a sum of laws and principles that make up the body politic of the UK". Unconstitutional means "not in accordance with a political constitution", whereas illegal means "contrary to or forbidden by law", and unlawful "not conforming to, permitted by, or recognized by law or rules". In this way, the difference between illegal/unlawful (against or not in accordance with the law) and unconstitutional (against or not in accordance with the constitution) only exists if we consider that the constitution is ''not'' a "sum of laws". 
:In a Canadian context it is relatively straight forward in that according to section 52 of the [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html Constitution Act, 1982], "The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada". However, just because the UK does not have a written constitution does not mean that there is no such thing as constitutional law in the UK. And just because the UK does not have constitutional courts to enforce constitutional law does not, once again, mean that constitutional law does not exist, only that "courts are subordinate to Parliament and have not the last word over what the law means"[https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/Core_Principles_of_the_British_Constitutions.pdf], i.e. Parliament fills this role. In this way, [https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/sovereignty/ Parliamentary sovereignty itself "is the most important part of the UK constitution"], and quite obviously parliamentary sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of UK law and has been upheld as such by the courts, such as Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke for example. 
:Given the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and the fact that [https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/sovereignty/ "Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation"] means that the UK Parliament can, de jure, enact laws that are contrary to existing laws (illegal) or are contrary to the constitution (unconstitional), as Parliament essentially governs itself and acts as its own court. Just because there is no higher legal authority than Parliament within the UK does not mean that it is not bound by rules however. For example, any legislation, treaty, or principle is binding ''until changed'', such as EU law and court rulings are binding within the UK because Parliament has legislated as such. 
:Which is to say that '''Parliamentary Sovereignty does not mean that Parliament is unbound by rules, only that it can ''change the rules''.''' 
:As such, this debate is not about parliamentary sovereignty as such, it is not disputed that the UK Parliament could unbind itself from a shared succession, just as Canada or Australia could. This debate is instead about the ''currently in force'' state of affairs, which is that currently the UK is bound to have the consent of the other realms prior to changing any of the rules governing succession, and failure to do so, according to your own sources, would be unconstitutional. Thus, the UK cannot ''currently'' unilaterally alter its own succession laws unless the Parliament of the UK explicitly chooses to change the rules and unbind itself from this restriction.

It is not possible for the Queen to be subordinate to herself. Each country is free to define the Royal succession according to its own laws. The Constitution of 1982 gives Canada full sovereignty so it is not bound by any British legislation. Each country is free to define the Royal succession according to its own laws. This means, for example, that Canada is not bound by the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013. Canada passed its own Succession to the Throne act in 2013 to harmonise with the British Act; but it currently faces legal challenges on the basis of Constitutionality. If it is declared unconstitutional it would not affect the immediate line of succession, but might have repercussions for the future.

:You seem to have missed the discussion.

Unlike other imperial laws, the succession laws never applied to Canada.  In fact all the new law says is "The alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne set out in the bill laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom and entitled A Bill to Make succession to the Crown not depend on gender; to make provision about Royal Marriages; and for connected purposes is assented to."

Don't let the fact that the two offices are called "queen" confuse you.  Just as there is a protocol in precedence for dukes and earls, so there is for kings and queens.  Because the British sovereign is queen of the UK, she is called queen in every territory she acquires.

::::TFD, what actually exists is a principle of symmetry or of mutual recognition. All of the realms must agree to any changes prior to implementation, thus the source that started this entire topic stating that "the realms were relatively freer to alter their constitutions than was the UK itself. This inversion of former imperial realities took some people by surprise". If Canada or the UK chose to break with this legal principle outlined in Statute, then this would of course be a break with the current rules and is beyond the scope of this conversation as we are discussing what is ''currently'' the case. So, to answer your question, if Canada were to break with the ''current'' succession and appoint Jim Carry as King of Canada why would the UK not recognize him as King? Well I think the answer to that is abundantly obvious as the rule of symmetry or of mutual recognition would no longer exist in this hypothetical scenario, and everything we have been discussing would no longer even apply, and neither would any of the court decisions or references cited so far. 
::::As for the argument about the Queen of Ontario being subordinate to the Queen of Canada, it is a strawman as there is no such thing as the office of "Queen of Ontario". Nothing of the sort exists. The Queen of Canada can act in various different capacities, such as head of the military (Command in Chief), at the federal level (in Right of Canada), at the provincial level (in Right of Ontario), within Parliament (Queen in Parliament), as the executive (Queen in Council), and judicially (Queen on the Bench). None of these capacities are subordinate or superior to the office of Queen of Canada.
::::Your continued assertion of the rule of ''mutual'' recognition or that of symmetry somehow making Canada subordinate to the UK is contrary to current political and legal realities, and is illogical. The key point being a ''mutually'' agreed to legal and political principle of maintaining the same lines of succession across 16 independent realms, there is no subordination in play once so ever. If the UK changes the rules of the game and unilaterally changes their own succession, then the rule of symmetry simply no longer exists as they would have a different line than all of the other realms, and there is once again no point in speculating what would happen if the rules of the game are changed in a hypothetical future as we are not discussing a hypothetical future different game, but the currently in place rules here and now.
::::And it is a fact that the Queen of Canada ''is'' Canada as a corporation sole as the human embodiment of the state and is legally constituted as Canada (juridical person, as opposed to natural person). Which is to say that Canada=Queen of Canada; UK=Queen of the UK; so to say at the same time that they are equal and subordinate is of course a complete logical contradiction.

Do those describe, in everyday parlance or constitutional theory or practice, the position of the monarch in UK and the same person in the "office" of monarch in Canada? Consider Charles I, on the death of his father James VI and I, becoming King of both Scotland and England, and neither of those positions being subordinate to the other (but in fact "wholly separate", except in having the same line of succession which continued while Charles II was in uncrowned exile) before the two kingdoms were later united, after [[Act of Settlement 1701|parliamentary]] alteration in the line of succession, as the Kingdom of Great Britain, with one parliament for the whole kingdom, while the same person was at the same time monarch of the separate Kingdom of Ireland.

:If the queen abdicated, then she would be succeeded by a president who would become king or queen of Canada.  That's what "her heirs and successors" means.  No doubt Canada would amend its royal styles and titles acts, at least dropping the "Queen of the United Kingdom" as part of the title, and probably declare a regency, otherwise they would be swearing allegiance to Boris the First. trackratte and Qexigator, it would be helpful if you would cite relevant opinions rather than providing your own.  The Queen of Ontario is indeed distinct, see for example ex parte Quark which states that the queen of New South Wales and the queen of the SSGI are all distinct from the the Queen of the UK.  They are all derivative offices, held by whoever happens to be Queen of the UK.  And symmetry is not a law but the reason for a law.  In order to have the same person as queen in Canada, Canada has accepted that the Queen of the UK should also be Queen of Canada.  Of course Canada could change that and adopt its own succession laws, and then the crowns would be as distinct as was the case of Scotland and Hanover.  But it has not done so.  You act as if it is some kind of weird coincidence that Canada should have the same monarch as the UK, that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that Canada used to be a British colony or that there is the teeniest pro-British sentiment in having the Queen of the UK as Canada's head of state.

::Given that if the Queen decided to abdicate the throne of the UK, an act of UK parliament would be required, and the heir apparent would succeed unless parliament enacted otherwise. We may surmise that some way of coping with royal assent would be engineered, and possibly some privy council accession proclamation. The effect of that in Canada or other realms would depend on what arrangements were made, and any legislation of a realm's own parliament such as would be upheld by that realm's judiciary. It could be that the UK act of parliament appointed the Queen's heir apparent  as first president of the United Republic of GB & NI for a term of years, as the Queen's successor in the newly created office of UK "president", taking office without coronation, but possibly with such oaths of office as had before been required of the monarch. How a second and later presidents would succeed the first would be prescribed by act of parliament (e.g., popular vote of some kind and some sort of electoral college, and with whatever restrictions or conditions would be prescribed for eligibility). There can be no certainty about what would then be the position in any of the other realms, but the position of office-holders who had undertaken (by oath or affirmation) loyalty to the Queen and her heirs and successors could be a question for judicial determination, whether or not any part of the reasoning in ''Quark'' was considered to be relevant.

It's very odd how TFD believes the effect of the preamble to one constitutional document (the Constitution Act 1867) is undoubted, yet the preamble to another constitutional document (the Statute of Westminster 1931) has no effect. One preamble states whomever is monarch of the UK is monarch of Canada (highly questionable; but, that's another issue). The other states the line of succession cannot be altered without the assent of the parliaments of all the other realms (which includes Canada). How could an amendment by the UK to its line of succession without the assent of the Parliament of Canada be recognised as having effect on Canada (who it's monarch is) when that act did not meet the requirement set in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster within the constitution of Canada?

The legislative outcome in the case of the Perth Agreement varied from realm to realm. ''If the UK were to abolish its monarchy & become a republic'' (per GoodDay above), it could be open to the Canadian parliament to follow precedent and pass an assenting act, but in addition to surmount difficulties in the Canadian constitution and proceed to legislate for some other way for appointing a successor to the Queen in the office of Canada's head of state, whether or not becoming a republic at the same time.

However, this is really about TFD's agreement with Boyce that the Canadian Crown is subordinate to the British one, an idea he builds upon the other idea that the monarch of Canada is always, invariably, ''no matter what'', whomever is sovereign of the UK. The argument has to pretend what's spelled out in the preamble to the SoW (namely, the assent of the other realms' parliaments is necessary before a change in succession can take place) is ineffectual. Yet, the whole notion that the monarch of Canada is supposed to be whomever is monarch of the UK is supposedly justified by the preamble to the Constitution Act 1867.

But note s. 9, which is binding, says "The Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen."  It notes that the Queen already had authority over Canada.  While she inherited it, it originally went to her ancestors through conquest and cession and these concepts were clearly explained in cases such as Calvin's Case and explained by jurists such as Coke and Blackstone.  Qexigator, the Queen's successor becomes sovereign of Canada, regardless of their legitimacy.  I suggest that you read Blackstone and relevant precedents, such as Calvin's Case.  And no, the office of monarch was not unfilled when, according to the Whigs, James II "abandoned" it, and there was no difference in the incumbent when Ireland took one day to acknwoledge the abdication of Edward VIII.  You are relying on opinions expressed by Massey and others in the 1930s that have no support today. And the succession acts are not part of Canadian law unlike other imperial laws such as the British North America Act 1867.

:::::: No, she inherited the crown of Canada because it belongs to however holds the crown of the UK.

:::::You are wrong and the Quebec Superior Court judge says as much:
::::::"In summary, because Canada is a constitutional monarchy, the King or Queen of the United Kingdom is the King or Queen of Canada. This principle flows from section 9 of the 1867 Act, in light of the preamble, which provides that Canada is 'under the Crown of the United Kingdom... with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom'.
::::::"This principle was not amended by the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, as the Parliament of the United Kingdom preserved the power to legislate and amend the rules governing succession to the throne, subject to the fact, however, that under the preamble of this statute, it must by constitutional convention obtain the assent of the other member countries of the Commonwealth."[https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qccs/doc/2016/2016qccs588/2016qccs588.html?resultIndex=4]
:::::You see? Both preambles have effect. "[T]he Parliament of the United Kingdom... must by constitutional convention obtain the assent of the other member countries of the Commonwealth". Even sticking with the dubious idea that the monarch of Canada is always whomever is monarch of the UK (a notion made all the more dubious by the Quebec Superior Court judge's claim assent is needed by all member states of the Commonwealth of Nations), Canada is not subordinate to the UK because Canada is powerless in the selection of its head of state. Even if whomever is the monarch of the UK is automatically monarch of Canada, the UK cannot legally or legitimately amend its line of succession without the assent of the Parliament of Canada. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 04:01, 31 July 2017 (UTC)

:::::TFD, the reasons you give for your opinion about Canada being in a 'subordinate position' are noted, and thank you for mentioning certain authoritative writers on the laws and customs of England, on a false assumption that they were unknown to me. I take your comment as not disagreeing with the obvious: that, while academics and others are inclined to argue such points indefinitely, if a time comes for contention to be actually resolved, this happens in the manner described in my comment above. Perhaps you will also agree that knowledge of the course of historical events in the development of English law and of the law of the United Kingdom, from and before the coronation of the Duke of Normandy as King of the English to and beyond the legislative change in the line of succession pursuant to the Perth Agreement, owes much to popular feeling, political expediency, and skilled legal drafting at the time, together with previous assumptions and aspirations for the future. That is unavoidably the background upon which depends any validity attributable to Boyce'e remark about reminding the Commonwealth realms that ''their crown is derivative, if not subordinate'' to the crown of the United Kingdom.

{{outdent}}Miesianical, I don't question that some people may consider preambles to be binding, it's just that they are not treated that way by the courts.  In any case, constitutional conventions are not binding.  So whoever becomes sovereign of the UK is automatically sovereign of Canada.  Hence the Canadian parliament did not amend the succession laws, because they do not apply to Canada.  In the same sense, the proverbial baseball club that names the mayor as its head does not have bylaws on how the mayor is chosen.  Canada of course could develop its own succession laws or become a republic, the fact is it has not.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 10:46, 31 July 2017 (UTC)

::If, under today's laws, the next in line of succession will become monarch of UK and of Canada at one and the same moment of time, it does not follow that it can be aptly said that Canada's crown is subordinate to UK's.

::+ How can it be said that the Canadian crown is subordinate to the UK crown when all appointments of officers and all things done in the name of the crown and in executing the office of monarch are done in the name of or for the Queen of Canada, free from intervention on the part of the UK crown? [[User:Qexigator|Qexigator]] ([[User talk:Qexigator|talk]]) 14:50, 31 July 2017 (UTC)

::+ The declaratory judgment of Quebec Superior Court judge (Claude Bouchard), linked above by Mies., refers in para. 47 to ''the rule of automatic recognition'' and quotes "The Queen or King of Canada is, according to the long-standing rule of automatic recognition, whoever is the Queen or King of the United Kingdom." We know that the 1867 act, quoted by the judge in paragraph 140, states  that Canada is “under the Crown of the United Kingdom", which could mean to that extent "subordinate", but that is superseded by current law. At the time of that judgment and today "the rule of automatic recognition" operates, but, as I understand it, noone would contend that the crown of Canada is today subordinate to the crown of UK in the sense of Canada lacking full sovereignty with the monarch as head of state.

::Miesianical, that is misreading.  The preamble begins, "Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom...."  That is not even a sentence, it is a clause that explains the reason for the legislation.  Hence the judge wrote, "This principle flows from section 9 of the 1867 Act, '''in light of the preamble'''."  The principle does not flow from the preamble, the preamble explains the principle.  Q, that the kingship of the UK and Canada are, and we now know always have been separate, does not mean that one is not subordinate to the other.  It is subordinate because whoever is king of the UK is automatically king of Canada, but not vice versa.  And that fact was confirmed by the Canadian government, parliament and the Quebec court.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 23:40, 31 July 2017 (UTC)
:::Yes, the preambles explain the conventions. The Constitution Act 1867: whomever is monarch of the UK is automatically monarch of Canada (questionable, at best). The Statute of Westminster 1931: the UK cannot alter its royal line of succession without the assent of the parliaments of the other realms. The (supposed) principle that the monarch of Canada is always whomever is monarch of the UK isn't even hinted at in S.9 of the Constitution Act 1867. It's the preamble that (supposedly) sets that convention. Since the preamble of the Constitution Act 1867 isn't ineffectual, then nor is the preamble to the Statute of Westminster 1931. And ''that'' means Canada is not subordinate to the UK because the UK is actually forced to obtain the assent of the Parliament of Canada before it can amend its succession laws, as the Quebec Superior Judge explicitly said: "under the preamble of this statute [the Statute of Westminster 1931], it [the Parliament of the UK] must by constitutional convention obtain the assent of the other member countries of the Commonwealth." Boyce's assertion may be allowable in Wikipedia because it's been published. But, it's certainly ''not'' in line with the majority opinion, contrary to what you keep claiming. --<span style="border-top:1px solid black;font-size:80%">[[User talk:Miesianiacal|<span style="background-color:black;color:white">'''₪'''</span>]] [[User:Miesianiacal|<span style="color:black">MIESIANIACAL</span>]]</span> 03:02, 1 August 2017 (UTC)

::...''Within the legal context under discussion''... Given all antecedents from 19th century to 21st, it can be more exactly (if pedantically) stated that succession to the office or position of monarch, or head of state, or "crown", in each one of today's realms, including UK, is subordinate to the theory and practise of ''the rule of automatic recognition'' [''la regle de la reconnaissance automatique''] (per Bouchard JSC Quebec in ''Motard's case'', para. <s>42, quoting Professor Benoit Pelletier's evidence to the Senate Committee studying the 2013 Act</s> <correction> 47 quoting Professor Oliver's report, referring to the Preamble and section 9 of the 1867 Act to declare that the rule of automatic recognition  applies: (quote) 104. The Queen or King of Canada is, according to the long-standing rule of automatic recognition, whoever is the Queen of King of the United Kingdom. The preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867, refers to the desire of the Provinces of Canada to be "federally united under the Crown of the United Kingdom…with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom"(endquote)</correction>[https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qccs/doc/2016/2016qccs588/2016qccs588.html?resultIndex=4], such that if a change in the line of succession is proposed realms participate in the manner demonstrated by the Perth Agreement legislation. Thus, it is the line of succession that is shared, but it is only loosely and imprecisely said that the monarch of one is shared with any of the others. Consider the position of one person who is chairman/president of 16 corporations carrying on different businesses independently of each other, each one formed, established and operating in a different country: would we say that in a legal context, this person is "shared" by the corporations, even if s/he receives reports from all of them and gives instructions to each of them daily, wherever in the world or at sea or in flight s/he might happen to be at the time?

:::The Canadian act assents to the change in the UK law, which is required by constitutional convention not constitutional law.  Absent that consent, the law would still be binding.  The Canadian Act says, "The [change in the British law] is assented to."  The British Act merely mentions "the Crown," i.e., the crown of the UK.  Notice Anne Twomey's opinion that Canada assented to a change in UK succession not Canadian succession.[http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/02/the_royal_succession_and_the_d.html]  She like the Canadian monarchists believed that the UK sovereign was not automatically Canada's sovereign, and Canadian succession was determined by Canadian laws.  Hence the Canadain act did not change succession to the Canadian throne.  While I think we should mention that view, we should also mention that Canadian and UK experts have come to a different conclusion.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 10:58, 1 August 2017 (UTC)

::::Twomey's article is out of date and unreliable. She purported to be writing as a constitutional lawyer, but her comment that the way Canada has sought to resolve its own federal problems with Quebec is "quite bizarre" indicates that her article is more of a polemic from a less than objective point of view, under the influence of her understanding of how things seem to her to be in Australia. She also opined: 
:::::"It is likely that the Canadian Government took the gamble of this approach in order to avoid the hassle of obtaining the agreement of the Provinces while banking upon the likelihood that no one would have the standing or motive to challenge it. Moreover, if the Duchess of Cambridge has a first-born son, it will avoid the problem of having a female monarch of the United Kingdom and a younger brother who becomes the monarch of Canada. Hence, the chances of getting by with such a constitutionally shoddy arrangement are reasonable." 
::::So far as Wikipedia npov is concerned, the simple fact is that Canada's parliament has legislated, the Quebec court has given its ruling, and there has been no further parliamentary or judicial proceedings to the contrary. That is how the matter rests, in respect of today's law of succession in Canada, and Twomey has shown where her emotions were influencing her writing.
