== Overview of satellites and Applications ==

I think that the most useful thing to add to this page would be a quick overview of both the Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2.  A quick overview of the mission and the reasons behind it would be great for Radarsat-1, and the improvements made to the Radarsat mission with the second satellite could be described for Radarsat-2.  Is there anything else that might be good in these sections?  Also, there could be a small section outlining the applications of this mission.

== People ==

I think it could maybe be useful to include some of the key people that have been involved with the RADARSAT program.  Possibly the heads of the programs.[[User:Tyler.reyes|Tyler.reyes]] ([[User talk:Tyler.reyes|talk]]) 03:56, 14 March 2017 (UTC)
:That sounds good.  This sounds like it could fit nicely in with an overview, perhaps with Radarsat-1 in describing who the mission is headed by and any significant roles they may play. -[[User:Ewoodard024|Ewoodard024]] ([[User talk:Ewoodard024|talk]]) 19:03, 18 March 2017 (UTC)

== Main users of RADARSAT data ==

So I think it is important to note that largest consumers of RADARSAT data and why they use such data.  

For example, the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) is one of the largest consumers of the RADARSAT-1 data.  Since RADARSAT data is readily available in near-real time, it is the best source of information to use for coastal monitoring, ship detection and maritime ice navigation.  Once the CIS has processed the data, it is then released to marine clients such as the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG).<ref>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.1998.10874689</ref>


Also I'm a rookie on here when it comes to citing, so please tell me if its not right. And comment if anything is actually untrue or there are missing pieces.
:I agree, this is useful information.  This sounds like it could fit in nicely with the section I proposed about applications of the Radarsat mission. Who, for what, and how people are using this data would be great things to include.  Also, while I'm not sure about the accuracy of your citation, one thing to note would be that after posting something on the talk page, you need to apply a signature so that people know it is you.  This is done by adding four tildes (~) at the end of your post. -[[User:Ewoodard024|Ewoodard024]] ([[User talk:Ewoodard024|talk]]) 19:11, 18 March 2017 (UTC)
