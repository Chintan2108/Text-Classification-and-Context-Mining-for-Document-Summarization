== CES/SEC ==
i don't know but 

Swiss Electrotechnical Committee (CES)
seems like it should be (SEC)
--[[User:Yskyflyer|E-Bod]] 22:39, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

Swiss Electrotechnical Committee is an English translation of Comité Electrotechnique Suisse. English is not an official language in Switzerland so CES is correct.

== IEEE vs. IEC ==

''The IEC publishes standards with the IEEE and develops standards jointly with the ISO [...].''

Then, why is there IEEE, and which of these two organizations develops what kind of standards? Or, put in another why - why is there IEEE when there already is IEC and ANSI? --[[User:Abdull|Abdull]] ([[User talk:Abdull|talk]]) 12:24, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

== What is IEC doing for the ISO standards....??? ==

Unfortunately, there is no consistent organization of the IEC standards pages here. The page may be named IEC-6000, or IEC 6000, or IEC6000. It may be in the IEC category, it may not.

I tried to add 4 links to the "see also" section:
** All pages starting with IEC: [[Special:PrefixIndex/IEC]]
** All pages in IEC category: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:IEC_standards]]
** All pages starting with ISO/IEC: [[Special:PrefixIndex/ISO/IEC]]

They aren't very clean links: I don't know how to do better, or if it is impossible to do better. Unfortunately, the change was reverted: it appears that the links were found by some error bot, which, because of the way the links were formed, thought that they were some kind of bad link.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/203.206.162.148|203.206.162.148]] ([[User talk:203.206.162.148#top|talk]]) 00:14, 17 January 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Quasi-governmental organization ==

The IEC article has used the description "Non-governmental organization" with no citation to back this up.  Reliable sources on the IEC (which is headquartered in Switzerland) tell us that it is, in fact, a "Quasi-governmental organization".<ref>{{Citation | place = CH | url = http://www.iec.ch/about/profile/funding.htm | title = IEC Organization and funding | publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission | year = 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | place = CH | url = https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/mission-onu-omc-aele-geneve/en/documents/GI--en-chiffres_EN.pdf | title = International Geneva, Facts and Figures | publisher = Swiss Government| year = 2017}}</ref>  Several attempts to replace the uncited and erroneous description have been reverted by other editors for no apparent reason.  Can anyone justify why sources should be ignored in favor of the personal preferences of other editors?

:Attempting to push through this "quasi-governmental" non-sense is a blatantly transparent move to give some shaky support to your arguments at [[Talk:NEMA connector#Terminology section]].

:: Please just stick to the facts, not your interpretation of them.  The IEC consists of national committees of the member counties.  Of the 60 full member countries of the IEC, at least 26 are represented by government departments or government agencies, so whatever the IEC is, it is clearly not "non-governmental".

:: It is clearly not valid to argue that the Swiss Government (the host state for the IEC) is irrelevant in determining the status of the IEC.

:: The IEC identifies itself as a "quasi-governmental organization" on at least three separate pages of its official website.  The fact that its Facebook page has an error is hardly significant, especially as that Facebook page also states: "The opinions expressed are those of the individual contributors and do not represent an official statement of the IEC."

:: You attribute a statement to the "Genevan Government", but the page cited is actually part of a site belonging to an independent operation called GVADATA.

:: You claim that "IEC Technical Committee 114 calls it a non-governmental organization" but the cited page is actually a website operated by the "US Technical Advisory Group" of TC 114, just a local group of a single Technical Committee who are clearly out of step with the IEC headquarters on the subject of the status of the IEC.

:: I fail to see the significance of references in assorted books which are clearly in error, as they do not quote the official information. [[User:JimmiCheddar|JimmiCheddar]] ([[User talk:JimmiCheddar|talk]]) 02:31, 20 November 2017 (UTC)

:::That you fail to see the significance of everybody else on the planet considering the IEC as an NGO is your problem. The North Korean government calls itself a "Democratic People's Republic". It is in fact an authoritarian communist dictatorship, but by your line of reasoning it's a democracy and a republic. Better go make that change at the [[North Korea]] article, Jimbo. See how far you get with that.

:::The Swiss government can make whatever distinctions between "non-governmental" and "quasi-governmental" it wants for its own internal purposes (taxes, grant monies, whatever). To the rest of us on planet Earth who don't really give a damn if this means the IEC pays a different tax rate than the IOC, or whatever it is that the ordinances of the Swiss ''Host State Act'' says: if it looks an NGO, walks like an NGO and quacks like an NGO, it's an NGO. That's why an endless number of people call it an NGO. That's why this article calls it an NGO. Argue ''ad nauseum'' all you want: quite simply if you disagree, you're wrong.

:::: Continuing to claim that the most relevant sources are wrong, and that you are right, is not a constructive way forward.  Comparing the Swiss Government and the IEC to North Korea is also not constructive.  The simplest solution to this would be to remove mention of any reference to NGO from the article and describe the IEC as a "non-profit international standards organization".

:{{outdent}} So the Swiss taxpayer pays to run IEC?  Whose taxpayers pay to run IEC? "Suppported" is a mealy mouth way of saying "paid".  Who pays for IEC?  Of course our article doesn't know. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 00:32, 22 November 2017 (UTC)
::So, IEC gets *no* money from the Swiss government and instead relies on standards sales (as anyone who's ever purchased an IEC standard knows, they are worth their weight in gold, perhaps more if you get the PDF versions), and membership fees.  Members are "national committees" - in Canada the member is [[Standards Council of Canada]], a corporation, which gets most of its revenue from non-governmental sources. In the US the member is ANSI, whose annual report shows no taxpayer money going in at all. How is it useful or accurate to describe IEC as "quasi" governmental?  Boeing gets more money from the US taxpayer than ANSI does - does that make Boeing quasi=governmental, too? --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 00:50, 22 November 2017 (UTC)

:::"'''''Despite seeking governmental recognition, the IEC was founded as and remains a nongovernmental organization.''''' ''In order to have no 'bureaucratic influence imported into the Commission','' '''''national technical societies, rather than governments, were to constitute each country's 'local [IEC] committee" and appoint representatives to the IEC. These national bodies constitute the IEC's member bodies to this day.'''''
:::'''''Why did the founders put such emphasis on the IEC being a non-govermental organization?''''' ''Institutional mimicry may have played some role, as the nongovernmental British Institution of Electrical Engineers served as the explicit inspiration for the IEC. But'' '''''the commitment to the nongovernmental character of the IEC had broad support''''' ''from many countries' delegates because it served quite diverse interests. For electrical engineers from Britain and the United States, self-regulation was among the hallmarks of the traditional liberal professions (law and medicine) which they sought to emulate. In continental Europe, with its different political traditions and lack of the liberal Anglo-Saxon notion of the "profession", the explict recognition of autonomy and self-government in professional and industry associations (even if sometimes more apparent than real) compensated for the lack of democracy in political life.''
:::'''''The sometimes adamantly nongovernmental character of the IEC has had three important consequences to this day. First, to underscore the nongovernmental cooperative character of the organization,''''' ''the founding delegates  agreed that "every country joining the Commission [should be placed] on an absolutely equal footing", with one vote per country whenever decisions were to be taken by vote. This system ensures that countries do not have influence in the IEC merely because they are large or possess economic or military power resources.''
:::'''''Second, the nongovernmental character of the IEC''''' ''has restricted the fungibility of power resources. Economically or militarily powerful states have often been able to use seemingly unrelated power resources to influence outcomes in international governmental organizations, such as ITU and WTO — allowing their economic interests sometimes to dominate the preferences of smaller/weaker states (through issue linkage and other means).'' '''''In IEC standardization, attempts at direct governmental interference are considered illegitimate and rarely even tried:''''' ''in the International Standards Project's survey about international product standards among manufacturing firms in five industries, barely 6 percent of those who most frequently use IEC standards said they 'sometimes' or 'often' ask for help from the government.''"
