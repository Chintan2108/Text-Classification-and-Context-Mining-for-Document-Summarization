== Substantial rewrite ==

I've just contributed a substantial rewrite of the entire article. It had been derelict for some time and neglected Wikipedia's core content policies, especially with regards to meeting [[WP:V]] and lacking necessary citations. I have removed the reference improvement tag. Any and all feedback on the rewrite would be appreciated.
