== Where is the discussion for moving this to "Electric Battery"? ==
{{collapse top|Old discussion, that doesn't contain an actual move proposal. Collapsing to prevent unnecessary !voting.}}
This article has been moved from ''Battery (electricity)'' to ''Electric Battery'' and back and back again.  Just ''Battery'' and not ''Electric Battery'' is the most common name. [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 23:42, 25 May 2018 (UTC)
:[[Battery]] is ambiguous, so it doesn't meet requirement #3 of [[WP:NAMINGCRITERIA]]. I don't understand why anyone would find the removal of the parenthetical disambiguation contentious, but obviously move-warring is not the answer. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 00:29, 26 May 2018 (UTC)
::Per [[MOS:DABPAGENAME]], In general, the title of a disambiguation page is the ambiguous term itself, provided there is no primary topic for that term. per [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], a topic is primary for a term with respect to usage if it is highly likely -- much more likely than any other topic, and more likely than all the other topics combined -- to be the topic sought when a reader searches for that term. While "Battery" often refers to an electric battery, that usage is not much more lik4ly that the mechanical term, the legal term, and the military/firearms term combined. --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 05:21, 26 May 2018 (UTC)

* '''Oppose move'''; restore to battery (electric<ins>ity</ins>). I'm unhappy with all the back and forth moves; it should have come to the talk page sooner. I disagree that "electric battery" is that natural, but agree that the term is used. In the past, somebody searching WP would type "battery" in the search box, see the potential completions, select "battery (electricity)", and go to this article. I think that is why there were so few hits on the "battery" DAB page -- users could find "battery (electricity)" and "battery (crime)" without visiting the DAB page. With the rename to "electric battery", we are in a different situation. If I type "battery" into the search bar, I don't get "electrical battery" or "battery (electricity)" as a completion. That means I must go to the DAB page, be surprised it is a DAB, and waste time finding the correct link. So we've taken the dominant article and forced users to go through a DAB where the less dominant article "battery (crime)" can be accessed more directly. Seems like a step backward.

*:: Actually, it was "battery (electricity)" before the current round of moves.... [[User:Glrx|Glrx]] ([[User talk:Glrx|talk]]) 21:07, 28 May 2018 (UTC)
*: The '''natural disambiguation''' prong wants "Using an alternative name that the subject is also commonly called in English reliable sources, albeit not as commonly as the preferred-but-ambiguous title." To get a sense of the term's usage in reliable sources, I searched Google Books.
*:: I get 37 M hits for "battery". Those hits will include other kinds of batteries, but the electrochemical one is dominant.
*:: I get 138,000 hits for "electric battery". Not very frequent compared to just battery. If I look at the first 10 hits, 4 of them are from more than 100 years ago, 2 of them are historical works from more than 45 years ago (the historical term would be "electric battery" because batteries were not common items in the 1800s). Of the four more contemporary works, 3 are specifically about electric vehicles and apparently reinforce "electric vehicle" with "electric battery powered vehicle" or "The vehicle consists of an electric battery for energy storage, ...." (Maybe the former is really an "electric, battery-powered, vehicle" or a "battery-powered electric-motor-driven vehicle. Remember, there are diesel-electric trains that don't use batteries.) Only one contemporary source has broader scope, and it is ''The Electric Battery: Charging Forward to a Low-Carbon Future'', by Kevin B. Jones, Benjamin B. Jervey, Matthew Roche, Sara Barnowski. Forgive me if I cringe at the pun. If I look inside the book, it is the result of the Smart Grid Project at the [[Vermont Law School]]; yes, lawyers might want to distinguish the topic from "battery (crime)".
*: Yes, "electric battery" is slightly used, but it is not commonly used today.
*: In most situations, the context is the energy storage object, so disambiguation is not needed. Then the phrase "electric battery" sounds redundant; it's like saying "electric electrochemical cell".
*: [[User:Glrx|Glrx]] ([[User talk:Glrx|talk]]) 16:21, 29 May 2018 (UTC)
* '''Support move.'''  "Electric battery" is a natural term, "electric" being drop when the context is already established, which is almost always the case, but is not for the title.  Note that the word comes from the word "batter", as in "to beat", or "to strike" or "to hit", through the [[Artillery battery|military meaning]] where multiple units in parallel would batter the target, and the analogy was carried to the multiple [[leyden jar]]s where multiple units in parallel were called a "battery".  It is clearly a derivative term.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 00:14, 27 May 2018 (UTC)

:::: As I said earlier: A parenthetical disambiguator is not considered as part of the "natural term" or "common name". Clearly not, given the vast number of WP article titles with such disambiguators. [[WP:COMMONNAME]] applies to the name independent of the disambiguator.

* '''Neutral:''' Before reading the above I favored "electric battery", and it still seems like the more natural term, but Girx makes a compelling argument. --[[User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon]] ([[User talk:Guy Macon|talk]]) 01:43, 27 May 2018 (UTC)
* '''Support''', as the instigator of the latest move.  Just naming the article "battery" has been discussed in the past, but that is probably not an option, because "battery" is a common term for lots of different concepts.  What can be usefully discussed here is whether "battery (electrical)" is a better article title than "electric battery".  My view on it is that natural English is preferable to Wikipedia's parenthetical jargon style.  A Google search for [https://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;electric+battery&#34; "electric battery"] shows that it is an existing natural-language disambiguator.  <br />Glrx does bring up the interesting point that when using Wikipedia's search box, typing "battery" will only display articles that start with the name "battery", necessitating a trip through [[battery]] to reach this article.  That's not an issue for me personally because Wikipedia's search engine is not very good &ndash; I use Google to search Wikipedia instead.  It might be an argument in favor of having the search box display disambiguation pages and not just full articles, though that's a technical issue that can't be resolved during this discussion.  But if not for that point, I wonder why anybody would think "battery (electrical)" is a better name for this article than "electric battery".--[[User:Father Goose|Father Goose]] ([[User talk:Father Goose|talk]]) 01:49, 27 May 2018 (UTC)
:: {{ping|Father Goose}} ("I tell you three times...") Because of [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. I do not see how anyone can be familiar with [[WP:COMMONNAME]] and support "electric battery", let alone instigate an undiscussed move to that! I've been learning about and "doing" electronics since the beginner's tutorial books described only germanium transistors and vacuum tubes and IME the term "electric battery" is anything but common. Granted that there are uses where we put the adjective first: We might go shopping for a "car battery", a "flashlight battery", a "camera battery", etc. But I don't recall ''ever'' hearing "electric battery" used, nor do I recall ever seeing a sign, product label, magazine article, book, printed or online catalog, or parts list callout that used that term.

:::Of course I just ask for a "battery" in a hardware store.  The problem is, we're not in a hardware store.

:::So at that point, it's a question of whether the article should be named "Electric battery" or "Battery (electrical)".  Ever tried asking for a "battery (electrical)" in a hardware store?

*'''Oppose''' WP house style seems to be the parenthetical word after an ambiguous title, to distinguish "Battery (electric)" from "Battery (film)" from "Battery (album)", using imaginary examples. Starting the title with "Battery..." at least keeps all the uses of the word together in alphabetical lists.  When was the last time you walked into a store and asked to see the "electric batteries" ?

:::{{reply|VQuakr}} I object to that characterization. It's a surprisingly close derivation of No. 3, considering I've never read the "article title- disambiguation" section till just now.   All the Google books hits I'm seeing for "electric battery" are either part of an adjectival phrase, some super academic writing, or 19th century uses. "Electric battery" doesn't sound natural and "battery, electric" looks like an inventory item.   --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 04:28, 27 May 2018 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' (restore Battery (electric)).  My reasoning is, electric battery is never used in ordinary language.  My mechanic says I need a new battery, not a new electric battery.  When I want to find batteries, I ask for batteries, not electric batteries.  There is just no way electric battery is natural.  Battery by itself is natural, but may be ambiguous.

*'''Oppose''' per user Constant314. These things are called "batteries" in common usage, in online catalogs, etc. Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]] the article title should therefore at least start with that. "Battery" with a link to a DA page for the crime or the tort or etc., or "Battery (electricity)", but not "Electric battery". glrx's description of the behavior of the search tool is also apt. (To address {{ping|SmokeyJoe}}'s point: It may be a poor tool but it gets a lot of use; we shouldn't just ignore it.) It does seem to me that in parenthetical disambiguation we prefer to use the name of the topic area rather than an adjective like "electric", so I would suggest "Battery (electricity)" instead of "electric".

*'''Oppose''' In stores, people ask for batteries. Battery is the common term in print and in conversation. A battery of artillery or the type which goes with assault are far less common. Use “battery” which is the common name, with the parenthetical disambiguator. “Electric battery” sounds rather antiquated, pedantic, quaint and precious.

This section sure could use more information. The NiCad article too.

Actually, a cell is a single "Battery" like an AA, but a Baterry is just a plural word for cell i.e. a battery is made up from lots od cells. I don't think this is made clear in the article.

==Cell vs. Battery==

Why not have some chemical equations?  There is an equivalent circuit of a battery here, but not much information on how electrochemical cells actually ''work''.  Does anyone who contributes to wikipedia know any chemistry?

Can the battery versus cell distinction be based on the fact that the cell voltage is fixed by electrochemistry while battery voltage can be any sum of cell voltages?

==Batteries in antiquity==
Hmm.. perhaps some more info on real batteries maybe? I dislike how you use the word battery vs. cell. Now that I'm thinking once more, I would like to see information about [[depolarizer|depolarizers]] on here, there is no article for it. You have jack information about that. Info on how hydrogen bubbles ruin batteries/cells through polarization during the discharge of a cell would help.--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 01:23, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Did they really use it for electric power (which to me implies an understanding of electric power to some degree), or did they use it for the side effects of electric power (which implies no understanding of electric power)?

An "A" battery was used on battery powered vacuum tube radios from the 1920's onward. The "A" battery was typically a rechargeable lead acid battery or for portable sets a dry cell battery composed of several cells could be used. The current draw was usually over .5 ampere. It had to produce this fairly large current to power the tube filaments. Powering a tube radio from dry cells was very expensive due to their rapid exhaustion, even when hooked up in a series-parallel arrangement. The "B" battery was a low current, high voltage dry cell battery(one or more 45 volt batteries in series) used to power the plate circuit.  A substitute today might be a number of 9 volt batteries in series. A "C" battery was a low voltage dry cell, 1.5 to 4.5 volts, used to provide grid bias for the circuit, and the terminology did not mean any equivalence with today's C cells. Today's equivalent might be 1 to 3 AA batteries in series. Except for rural users who had no electric utility and portable sets, the battery sets were largely obsolete by the late 1920's, when sets powered by 120 volt alternating current or direct current came along, eliminating the cost of buying batteries or paying to have the A battery recharged at a radio shop. Would a referenced historical section on these batteries be appropriate for inclusion?[[User:Edison|Edison]] 15:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

Sorry, just found Wiki articles on "A" "B" and "C" batteries which provide a similar explanation to the above. It seems odd to have individual encyclopedia articles on each size of battery. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 18:40, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

=="gravity cell"==

:''Some researchers called the battery a ''gravity cell'' because gravity kept the two sulfates separated.''

''What'' sulfates? The context is missing, making this sentence rather unintelligible.

:The cell (also called the [[Daniell cell]]) refered to here used copper sulfate and zinc sulfate on opposite sides of a porous membrain. The cell used copper and zinc electrodes each of which had to be in a solution of its own sulfate, or to keep the cell functioning. A diagram of a typical cell appears here:

== Etymology ==
Our article claims:
:''[Benjamin Franklin]... adapted the word from its earlier sense meaning ''a beating'', which is what an electric shock from the apparatus felt like.''
Is there any evidence for this claim? My dictionary claims that by analogy with a battery of artillery, battery had come to mean a group of things joined together to give an enhanced effect; and that an electric battery is just such a battery of galvanic cells. [[User:Securiger|Securiger]] 07:14, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::When Volta (from whose name  the unit of measure volt) invented the battery, it was made of a raw of many diffferent disks (of two type, disposed alternatevely). The term battery (also in Italian and maybe in Latin) originally mean ''a group of similar thing that are kept together''. I have found this meanig also in my little (modern) English dictionary. In my humbly opinion the link between battery and beat are quite not evident. In Italian the term 'batteria' nowdays means also a musical instrument: the drums (I mean the set of drums, cymbals and so on). Even if many persons not correctlly belive the term came from to beat (in Italian 'battere'), it cames from the fact that it a set of instrument. The name 'piles' comes from the Volta's bactery. It was a vertical coloum with many disk disposed in a pile. Often many batteries are used connected in series or paraller. Even if you see just one battery sometimes inside there are some battery connected among them. This is the case of the battery of 4.5 V (that by the way is not in the table) that is made by 3 real batteries of 1.5 V (but do not open it if do not know how to do it safely, be careful) [[User:AnyFile|AnyFile]] 11:26, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Volta invented the ''electrochemical'' battery in [[1799]], but Franklin invented the ''electrostatic'' battery before that.  It was Franklin who first used the word ''battery'' in the electrical sense, referring to an array of eleven capacitors, in a letter to Peter Collinson of the Royal Society in London on the 29th of April [[1749]].  (There is a transcript of the letter [http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/fellows/bob_morse_04/04_Franklin_Lab_Part_IV.pdf here]). You are probably right that Franklin was using the word in the sense of "an array of objects", not as in "a beating", but he probably chose that word (instead of the more obvious alternatives such as "array" or "whole bunch") because of its association with violence. --[[User:Heron|Heron]] 14:58, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::The OED also gives the derivation for "battery" in the electrical sense from its meaning of "a number of pieces of artillery placed in juxtaposition for combined action" as opposed to the whacking-about-the-body-with-a-stick meaning. Even if Franklin was influenced by the word's association with violence, it would seem the current etymology given in this article is incorrect. Any objections to changing it?

I don't think a fuel cell "stores" energy. [[User:Brianjd|Brianjd]] 08:16, 2004 Nov 16 (UTC)

:Batteries come with a store of chemical reactants ''built-in'' whereas in fuel cells, the reactants are supplied by and from mechanisms and storage tanks external to the cell (so they're something like a battery that is continuously being recharged by replacing the reactant chemicals as they are exhausted).

:[[User:Atlant|Atlant]] 16:31, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::In a broader sense batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy. A flow battery also has (some or all) of its energy store outside of the converter/ reactor. Therefore, a fuel cell could be considered as a type of battery. Also metal-air batteries (also known as consumable anode fuel cells) take air as one of their reactive components - battery or not?

== Why do they break down? ==
A friend of mine asked why batteries go bad -- you know, they just start pushing crap out their ends if they're not used for a while.  Tried to find the info here, couldn't.  Maybe someone should add it?  Or am I just looking at the wrong article?  Anyway, it should probably be pointed out better if it is in a different article.  Cheers. [[User:CryptoDerk|CryptoDerk]] 17:33, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)

That is an excellent question.
I suspect that there are several different failure modes for batteries.
Let me try adding my best guess to the article.
Does anyone know any better?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:12, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

:The material is electrolyte paste and corroded metal. In the original carbon-zinc dry cell this happened very frequently becaused the "consumed" zinc electrode was the ''outer can'' of the cell and almost always developed holes through which electrolyte leaked just before it died. Modern batteries invert this construction, putting the "consumed" electrode on the inside and enclosing the cell in a steel jacket. However there are still a few small paths through which electrolyte can occasionally leak even in these cells (however it is usually limited to the ends by the steel jacket &ndash; the old cells could leak anywhere... wherever the zinc was eaten through first).

:But as [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] stated, batteries have many failure modes, this leakage of electrolyte paste is only the external symptom of any of several internal failures. -- [[User:205.175.225.5|205.175.225.5]] 02:23, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::Yep, old batteries could broke of their own. Today, some batteries "become older" and don't give as much power than before. But the main origin of their poor lifetime is from the manufacturer. They install a small system which lets some of the respective electrodes slowly melt with the other one, definitly damaging the cell. Of course, they wouldn't want to sell batteries which can be used during 10 years ( if they can be charged ), they usually break down after one year ... So that you go to buy an other one ;-). So the battery can deplete even if it has never been used. This can't be much used in generic batteries, but in specific batteries, as in electronic products, you can find this system --[[User:Totophe64|Totophe64]] 18:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

== Amps? ==

How many amperes are in AA, AAA, C and D batteries?

:You need to ask a "more specific" question. :-)

:What you're probably asking is "How many Ampere-Hours" in each size of battery. The answer to that varies depending on the exact battery technology and vendor, but '''roughly speaking''', an AAA '''alkaline''' battery is about 800 mAH, an AA battery is about 2000 mAH, and a D cell is probably 8 or 10 AH. By comparison, in NiMH, an AA battery rated 1800 mAH is about as good as it gets today ([[2004]]).

:You might also be asking the question "How much current can a battery comfortably deliver?". In this case, NiCd and NiMH batteries are probably the winner (which is why NiCd batteries are still used in portable tools). Again, for a specific answer, you'll need to specify which type of battery (Carbon/Zinc, Alkaline, NiCd, NiMH, Lithium, etc.)

Or in other words, "How much energy is stored in this battery?" and "How quickly can I get all that energy out?".

We probably don't need the link to the battery disambiguation page, though it isn't very intrusive and doesn't hurt to have it either.

Someone put it there in response to my request when I reverted someone else's deletion of a link to one other specific meaning.  At the time, I was under the mistaken impression that this Battery (electricity) article remained the default article rather than the disambiguation page.  But that isn't the case, and existing links appear to have been changed (except talk pages which we don't need to worry about), so most anyone who ends up at Battery (electricity) should be where they belong.  But then, maybe the discussion here will lead someone to wonder about similar meanings, and the link to the disambiguation page would be helpful.

== energy cost of batteries ==

Some people claim that hybrid-electric vehicles and BEVs ultimately consume more fossil fuel than internal combustion engines.
They claim that constructing the batteries themselves requires lots of grid electricity (and it occurs in countries where most electrical power comes from fossil fuels).
This large amout of fossil fuel consumed is never quite paid back by the better efficiency of the electric vehicles in operation.

A very rough estimate is made by
[http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/06/toyota_and_the.php#c54941 j.pickens].
It seems to support such claims.
Does anyone know a more accurate estimate?

The argument sounds very similar to the [[Talk:Solar cell]] and [[Net energy gain]].

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:12, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

: Unfortunently j.pickens has a few figures wrong, the $6000 Prius battery is more like $3000 MSRP plus $3000 core exchange, which might be where the $6K figure came from.  In all reality the battery cost Toyota about $500 as the going high production volume rate is in the $500-$1000/kWh range for NiMH.  Just for further referance Li-ion is at about $400/kWh.  Now re-running his figures from the point of this error leaves us with 50% energy input or $250 worth of energy to create the battery pack.  At $0.09/kWh we get 22.5kWh and not 33,000kWh to produce the battery, that's about the energy content of 1 gallon of gas vs 1000 gallons.  Anyway, all of this is moot and I may have even misplaced a decimal.  There really must be better referances out there.  Can we get Sony or Panasonic to tell us what it actually costs them to run a factory for a year which produces X quantity of such and such battery?  This would include to materials, labor, energy, etc, etc for a much clearer picture... --[[User:D0li0|D0li0]] 13:24, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

:: Another approach would be to estimate the dollar value of the motor fuel savings over the life of the Prius battery. Presumably the hybrid powerplant has to yield a net ''monetary'' savings to the consumer, or it would not make sense to buy. Suppose the battery lasts for six years and saves $1000 in fuel per year. Then it would just break even at a $6000 replacement cost if we ignore the time value of money. If the consumer just breaks even, there must be a net energy savings, because the savings is all energy (fuel) cost, whereas the battery cost includes other non-energy costs such as labor and so on to manufacture. The hybrid powerplant might provide other advantages, such as less vulnerability to temporary shortages of fuel. If terrorists blow up Saudi Arabia or there is some other fuel emergency and governments have to impose rationing, hybrid drivers will probably fare better than [[Hummer]] drivers. Even if the hybrid vehicle yields no net energy savings, it will ''already have been manufactured'' and thus is not as dependent on the momentary supply of fuel. Of course a [[bicycle]] is even less dependent on the momentary supply of fuel, and thus confers even more energy security. --[[User:Teratornis|Teratornis]] 20:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Can anyone verify or perhaps add to the current current article.

Thanks :)


I certainly wouldn't invest in this technology. This appears to be a fairly standard Al-air battery where they use ozone in place of air. This supposedly gives a slight increase in the cell voltage. Although it is clear where air comes from, how is the ozone produced? They mention using high voltages. This would entail an energy input to make the battery operate. So where does the initial energy come from? I wouldn't take this idea to seriously until they have published some peer-reviewed experimental results. [[User:Ahw001|Ahw001]] 06:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:I wonder if this recent text is actually a mistake? I've read about [[supercapacitor]]s being used as stand-ins for batteries (and some of them are "big" enough that they're rated in mAH: [http://www.epcos.com/inf/20/35/ds/B49410B2506Q000.pdf 3500 mAH!]), but I haven't yet hear about any "ultra-high-'''voltage''' capacitors being used.

:Then again, the Supercaps article contains this text:

::''As of spring 2006, EEStor Inc. claims to have a supercapacitor with a barium titanate dielectric nearing production. The company claims a unit with 37 farads capacitance and an operating voltage of 3.5 kV, capable of storing up to 52kWh. The technology is scheduled for third-party verification during the summer of 2006.''

:so maybe by supercap standards 3.5KV is "ultra-high voltage"? It's certainly about 1400 times more than your typical low-voltage supercap.

::''What are the toxic materials?''
::''What type of battery is the most/least environmental?''

[[User:Atlant|Atlant]] 23:52, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:Rough answer: the energy cost to manufacture any product is unlikely to exceed the normal selling price to the consumer, assuming the vendor is trying to make a profit (this is just common sense). Because the retail price has to pay for other costs (materials, labor, amortization on equipment, taxes), the energy cost will generally be some fraction of the ordinary final selling price, perhaps in the range of 10%-25%. Even when products are discounted during clearance sales, they rarely get discounted below the net cost of the energy required to make them and get them to the consumer. Most of the energy will have been purchased at industrial rates, but these are probably similar to what the individual pays for electricity and fuel, because the energy market is efficient and highly commoditized. Thus if a disposable battery retails for, say, US$1, you can look at your electric bill and see how much electric energy you can purchase for US$0.25, and that's probably an upper bound on the energy consumed to make that product and present it for sale to you. Note that for a disposable battery, the cost of the electricity it yields is many times higher than what the local power company charges. Residential consumers might pay from US$0.05 to US$0.10 per [[Watt-hour|kW·h]]. Suppose a disposable battery retails for US$1 and yields 1 W·h. This is on the order of US$1000 per kW·h delivered, which in turn is on the order of ten thousand times the cost for residential electricity. Another way to look at it is that the disposable battery probably required around a thousand times as much energy to manufacture and distribute to the consumer as it will yield when the consumer uses it. [[Rechargeable batteries]] obviously can have much better economics, and correspondingly lower environmental impact, when they take hundreds or thousands of recharges. But since the consumer has to pay for the electricity to recharge them, rechargeable batteries still end up costing more than electricity at the wall outlet, but not by nearly as large a multiple as disposable batteries, of course.

== Homemade batteries ==

The article talks about replacing the fruit in the homemade batteries because it gets used up.  I don't think it is the fruit that wears down the battery.  Maybe the fruit gets old & moldy & doesn't conduct as wel, but it is not the cause of the battery not working.  The energy comes from the chemical transformation of the metal electrodes into their oxides or their chlorides or whatever the transformation is.  The fruit is merely the path that the electricity takes, like the wires in a circuit.

==History==

Is there any source for Franklin connecting capacitors in series and in parallel? I can well believe he connected them in parallel, because that is basically the same as having a larger Leyden jar. But the concept of series and parallel electrical connection were cutting edge in the 1830s, when Joseph Henry distinguished "intensity" (series) from ""quantity" (parallel ) connections of cells and of windings. Morse, for instance, in the 1830s had no concept that a low resistance electromagnet and a single cell could not operate a telegraph over an appreciable distance through the high resistance of the wires. To connect several Leyden jars in series to increase the voltage, Franklin would have needed to charge them individually with his friction machine, and place the jars on a thick clean glass surface to avoid the table they sat on from draining off the voltage between the outer foils of the jars. Absent a verifiable source, this claim should be removed.[[User:Edison|Edison]] 18:02, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

== NiMH vs. NiCd text removed ==

I removed this section:

:Most Ni-MH batteries can be recharged 500-1000 times whereas Ni-Cd batteries can only be recharged about 400 times. (I am afraid, but other sources states that it is possible to recharge Ni-MH twice as less times as Ni-Cd. That is: nickel-cadmium provides over 1000 charge/discharge cycles; nickel-metal-hydride the performance starts to deteriorate after 200-300 cycles if repeatedly deeply cycled.  [http://www.batteryuniversity.com/partone-4.htm])

because of the two contradicting viewpoints.  We need more authoritative sources if we're going to say which type lasts longer, if such a judgement can be made at all.  --[[User:Heron|Heron]] 17:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

==A battery, B battery Problem==
There is a Wikipedia article for the B battery, used in tube radios. Now there is no link to it from here, and no link to it from the article on battery sizes. There used to be an article on the "A battery" used in tude radios, but now if you go to "A battery" you are misdirected to "AA battery," which has nothing whatever to do with the big old battery used to provide filament current for vacuum tubes. See my discussion above from June 7. I own a couple of radios from the 1920's which use A batteries, B batteries, and C batteries. I guess I will re-link this article to "B battery" and add a link from battery sizes to "B battery." How does one find an article which has been deleted, like "A battery"???[[User:Edison|Edison]] 14:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
Found the batteries under [[Battery (vacuum tubes)#A battery]] etc and added links where appropriate. Also added historical info on the use of lead-acid batteries for electric cars in the early 20th century, radio batteries in the 1920's, and local batteries for early 20th century phone. These were probably a very big portion of the sales of batteries in the early 20th century. There should also be info on battery-powered flashlights. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 15:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

==Atomic Battery==

Did you know that in the 50s or the 60s, modern science has invented the [[nuclear battery]] ? I've seen depictions in old science books, one saying that one of these can put out 250,000 volts, but the amps are low. It was the size of a "D" cell, was either a Kr-85 or a Cerium -150 unit. [[User:Martial Law|Martial Law]] 21:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
:What on Earth do you need 250 kV's for? High voltage is good for long distance transmission, but for everyday use, locally, it doesn't make much sense. Dry air has about 30kV/cm breakdown voltage limit before it sparks through, meaning your 250 kV terminals would have to be separated by at least 10 cm, and even then they'd pretty much short circuit through air at the slightest instability in ionization, such as extra moisture, or just take the surface resistivity path and dance along the battery surface and short circuit. What's good about these batteries (functioning at reasonable, low voltages) is that they can last very long, and function even in places with no sunshine, or limited sunshine, such as deep space probes flying by Pluto, where the Sun is so distant that solar panels don't produce enough energy. As far as efficiency in energy conversion goes, these batteries aren't stellar, but neither is anything else nuclear (current power plants near 35%, your battery is probably much less.) Their capacity is still pretty good on a volume/weight basis, because nuclear fuel is so dense in energy, though their use in everyday terrestrial applications would probably never happen because of terrorism issues - any kind of nuclear battery is pretty much limited to heavily supervised space/military type applications. So why bother thinking about it? If you can come up with a tamperproof containment method, where you can give it to the public, and the container is so resistant that it cannot be melted at least to 3000C electric arc or acetylene torch, or punctured/crushed by dropping a 1 ton block of steel on it, and it can survive inside an explosion conventionally detonated TNT mixture at high pressures/temperatures with sudden shock, without anything happening to the container and its contents, then we can talk. Can you come up with such a tamperproof container? Otherwise forget about it.[[User:Sillybilly|Sillybilly]] 06:05, 9 September 2006 (UTC)


== Batteries produce direct current? ==

I've fixed the description a bit.  Batteries ''don't'' produce DC, since the current depends on the load.  Look at the load current in any electronic device any you'll usually see lots of rapid changes (lots of AC.)   Instead, batteries produce constant or DC voltage.  The term "DC" means "unvarying" when used in this way.  (Engineers use AC/DC to mean varying/unvarying, rather than their more obvious meaning as direct current and alternating current.  Hence "DC voltage" means "constant voltage" and not "direct current voltage.")  For this reason batteries are known as "DC devices."  

Also, the idea that batteries produce a constant direct current is a very common misconception.  L. McDermott just described this misconception as common among grade school science teachers (article in American Journal of Physics, Sept 2006 issue.)  For this reason we should avoid saying that a battery can "produce current."   It's more accurate to say that a battery produces voltage.  A load can draw a current, but this current depends on the load, and if the value of load should vary, the current will also vary.  Indeed, if the load is a changing capacitance, then the battery will "produce AC."  --[[User:Wjbeaty|Wjbeaty]] 20:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

My Battery Summary!! By : Farasat Siddiqui (c) 


Batteries

A battery can be thought up as a medium that stores energy or a can full of chemicals that produces electrons. Batteries come in all types of different shapes, sizes and prices. They range from small circular batteries used in watches costing only a few dollars to batteries for car engines costing $30,000.

Primary and Secondary batteries are the 2 categories of batteries. Primary batteries are the “cheaper” and most often used batteries but they can be "wasteful” they have to be thrown away because they are not rechargeable. Usually these are AA, AAA, D, C; etc.These can cause toxic waste problems. On the other hand Secondary Batteries are the rechargeable type. These are usually car batteries, computer batteries etc. Secondary batteries or rechargeable batteries are made up of 2 components, wet cells and dry cells. Wet cells are used to start up things and dry cells are used up to make batteries able to be recharged.

	There are many battery types like, conventional lead acid at 35 watts per kilogram, sealed lead acid at 39 watts per kilogram, bi-polar acid at 50 watts per kilogram, nickel cadium at 55 watts per kilogram, nickel iron of 55 watts per kilogram, nickel-metal hydrate at 90 watts per kilogram, sodium sulphur at 110 watts per kilogram, and at the most lithium at 155 watts per kilogram.     

	Batteries operate from electrolytes. An electrolyte comes in liquids and it is a combination of chemicals. Batteries have two terminals. These are Positive and Negative. What is usually found at the top of a standard everyday battery is the positive terminal, the “thing” that comes out. It connects the battery to another object to make it work. A battery also needs a voltaic cell. A voltaic cell works by using a strip or rod of copper and sulfuric acid mixed with water. More cells create higher voltage.

	From this you can see batteries have different forms, different types, different prices, and complex structures. Batteries are used in everyday life and people would be amazed by how many things would go wrong if batteries did not exist.

==Invention probably in 1799, announcement definitely in 1800==
Most sources associate Volta's pile with the year 1800. Many phrase this in wording like "Volta announced his development of the pile in 1800." 1800 was the year when Volta sent a description of the pile to the Royal Society (in April), which was read before the Society in June, and according to one source "caused a sensation." 

Some sources describe Volta as having ''invented'' the battery in 1799. This seems very likely, but quick searches didn't turn up anything really definitive as to when he actually ''did'' the work that he wrote about in April, 1800. The actual 1800 published paper does not address this. 

Many sources do actually say that Volta first constructed the pile in 1800, e.g. "In 1800, Volta constructed the first galvanic cell,"[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN2881245692&id=53APqy0KDaQC&pg=PA310&lpg=PA310&sig=SRQ-SFpQNzgo3_3WLDNfyAqibyg]." Others say that Volta ''anounced'' it in 1800. 

I suspect the sources that say he first invented or constructed it in 1800 are likely mistaken and careless, but in any case, it seems that it was the pile's ''announcement'' which "caused a sensation" and was really the significant event. 

I think the safest thing to do is to stick to the statement that Volta ''announced'' the pile in 1800, while noting in a footnote that some sources say he ''invented'' it in 1799. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]] 21:56, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

== Explosions ==

There is a recurring safety problem with lead-acid batteries, i.e they occasionally explode when their hydrogen+oxygen emissions are ignited by a nearby flame source (e.g. a pilot light).  The reason for the emissions is touched upon, but there's no detail discussion.  Since there's a growing trend to electric micro-cars, will there be a resulting epidemic of house explosions when they are being re-charged indoors at night? [[User:154.20.137.51|154.20.137.51]] 23:32, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:Hydrogen is only evolved when a battery is allowed to overcharge and [[electrolysis]] of the water in the electrolyte ensues. Presumably, the high-quality, intelligent battery chargers in electric cars wouldn't allow this to happen and there would be additional safety measures that would come into play if the charger tried to overcharge the batteries.

:(Some) batteries can also explode if they are short-circuited. Presumably, the battery packs would be [[Fuse (electrical)|fused]], but I suppose a single cell could certainly short-circuit under certain circumstances; [[Lithium battery|lithium batteries]] are in the news from time-to-time for exactly this sort of thing.

:Bottom line: I suppose battery-caused fires will be rare but definitely not non-existent. But then again, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]s have been known to burn houses to the ground when [[brake fluid]] leaked into the [[Automotive lighting|brake light]] switch and caught fire.

==Good article nomination on hold==

The thing that really impressed me with this article was the good breadth of coverage of the subject, and the article was also quite well written.  Having said this, the lead section does need to be totally re-written to summarise the main points of the article, and more inline citations are needed to support what is being said, especially in the "Battery explosion", "Battery packs" and "Traction batteries" sections which are without references.  

The one other significant issue relates to the structure of the article and the positioning of the section on "Types of batteries".  I would have thought that this section could have come much earlier, probably after "Classification of batteries". The "Effect of a battery's internal resistance" section also seemed somewhat out of place but I'm not sure where it should be moved to.  You may wish to consider making a couple of sub-sections in the "Battery lifetime" section, and consider breaking up the very long paragraph on automotive lead-acid rechargeable batteries. 
 
Minor points: Is the positive electrode really called the cathode?  I thought it was the anode.  There are a couple of one-sentence paragraphs, which should probably be expanded or incorporated into another paragraph.  Also I couldn't see where some of the abbreviations in the Table (eg., ANSI, NEDA, IEC) were spelt out.  This line at the end, "See also: battery electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicle", needs to be incorporated into the text. No need to number the bibliography; it's confusing.  

I've decided to put this article '''on hold''' as the article is close to GA status, however the issues noted above must be dealt with before GA status can be awarded. I hope that this can be addressed within the seven days allowed by on hold, and wish you all the best with your editing... -- [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] 06:10, 12 August 2007 (UTC)

:I've addressed the following points: 1) I've moved "Types of batteries." 2) According to [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cathode Dictionary.com], the cathode is negative when talking about an electron tube or electrolytic cell, but positive when talking about a voltaic cell or battery.

Hi King, I'm pleased that progress is being made with this article, but it is still not worthy of GA status at this time.  I've added a couple of maintenance tags for further guidance.  Please consider re-submitting the article after improvements are made.  --  [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] 03:17, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

==Good article re-nomination==
I saw this on GA, and decided to take a look. In my first quick pass, I found a grammatical error, a technical error, and a significant omission, which I fixed (see history). If this is indicative of the article as a whole, it is still not ready for GA. I don't have time to do a full review, but I would suggest withdrawing the nom and getting some expert help before renominating. You also might consider breaking it up and moving some detail to child articles, as it is a very comprehensive subject. Sorry to be brutally honest, but if you really want this to be GA, you should appreciate the feedback. It's difficult to cover such a broad topic well, so you have taken on a big task. Good luck.

Also, if the nom is not withdrawn, I would suggest only a subject matter expert review this, as it is a very technically demanding subject. [[User:Dhaluza|Dhaluza]] 21:11, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

- - - -

As noted above, this is a technically demanding subject and I think the people who prepared the article have done a pretty good job.  

Looking at the introduction, I think it is a bit too long.  Some ways to improve it might be: 

- <s>don't get into factors affecting capacity in the introduction</s>

- don't get into how to prolong battery life in the introduction

- don't get into factors affecting capacity in the introduction

- If the second sentence is about electrochemical cells THAT ARE NOT batteries, it is confusing to have it here because it interrupts the story.

- I think the Baghdad battery could be left out of the introduction.  Interesting sidelight, but not required reading for someone looking for a basic understanding of batteries. (IMHO)

- Did batteries really become portable and useful "soon" after 1800?  Personally, I find that difficult to believe.

- Jumping from the invention of the thing in 1800 to the environmental concerns around disposal is a big jump.  There should be at least a sentence or two in between about the refining of the technology and the current (no pun meant) huge use of batteries.

- I gather that rechargeable battery means the same thing as secondary battery, but I had to get a long way into the article before that was clearly said.  It might be better if this was made clear as soon as the second word was used.  Also, if both words mean the same, do both need to be used in the introduction?

I hope some of this comment is useful.  [[User:Wanderer57|Wanderer57]] 23:27, 3 October 2007 (UTC)



== Second good article nomination failed ==
This article was posted as good article candidate on September 7, 2006. I have read the article, and while it is a pretty good article, I don't think it yet qualifies as a Good Article. Most of the article is well-written, interesting and in-depth. However, there are several substantial issues that I feel need to be changed before the article can pass GAN.
# '''Overall organization:''' While each section of the article is self-contained and well-written, there is some overlap between the sections. Reading the article from start to finish, I get the impression (all too familiar in WP articles) that bits and pieces were written by different people and need some synthesis. For example, "Classification of batteries" says that there are two types of batteries, primary and secondary; the next section, "Types of batteries," says the same thing, except that now these two types are called "disposable" and "rechargeable." These two sections should definitely be merged, and there should be consistent naming throughout the article. In general, I think some more attention should be given to what is the best way to present the extensive information we've got here. One possibility:
## ''History'': Current version looks good
## ''Operation'': Technical information, including the sections: How batteries work, Conversion to energy, Effect of a battery's internal resistance
## ''Types of batteries'': User-oriented information, including the current sections: Types of batteries, Classification of batteries, and Battery lifetime)
## ''Environmental considerations''
# '''References:''' From [[WP:WIAGA]]: a good article should provide "in-line citations from [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] for [...] statistics, published opinion," etc. Although there are quite a few references, many of them are not from reliable sources. Maybe this isn't the place for primary sources, since so much of the material here is uncontested scientific fact. But there should be much more of an effort to cite scholarly textbooks and articles, rather than commercial websites. A single textbook on battery engineering could probably easily replace 20-30 of the references to howstuffworks.com, about.com, and battery supplier websites.
# '''Smaller issues:''' (the very minor issues I fixed myself, following are the things I didn't feel knowledgeable enough to do)
## From the lead: "Other types of electrochemical cells include electrolytic cells, fuel cells, flow cells, or voltaic cells." The term ''electrochemical cell'' has not yet been defined, so it is confusing to read about "other types" of such cells. 
## History section: "presumably after the earlier use by Benjamin Franklin": this sentence is not clear; what is the relation between a battery and a Leyden jar? What ''is'' a Leyden jar?
## "How batteries work": The <nowiki>{{main}}</nowiki> given for this section is about as long as the section itself. Either shorten the section or remove the <nowiki>{{main}}</nowiki> template.
## Also in "How batteries work": I think this explanation could be improved by including the description of the flow of electrons in the cable, the flow of ions in the liquid, etc., so that there is a clear understanding of the circuit being closed. Also it would be helpful if discussion is about a concrete example (such as the Cu-Zn example in the figure), where the chemical reactions are described in chemical reaction notation. Sentences like "Each half cell emf is due to a charge-transferring chemical reaction at the electrode-electrolyte interface" don't say very much to someone who doesn't already know what all the terms mean, and they are not explained in the text.
## In the beginning of "Types of batteries" there are two long paragraphs about lead-acid batteries, a particular type of rechargeable battery, but only a very short paragraph about all other types of rechargeable batteries. Later on there is a short section "Rechargeable" where lead-acid batteries are only briefly mentioned.
## The subsection "Disposable" is listy. 
## "Traction batteries": does this really belong inside "Battery packs" or should it be a separate section?
## The glossary doesn't really define the terms, only explains some abbreviations. What does "nominal capacity, in Ah (or submultiplier mAh) for a given voltage" mean? Presumably by capacity you mean amount of energy stored, but the link to [[capacitance]] talks about something totally different. You should also explain why we are talking about "nominal" capacity.

In conclusion, I think this article has a ''lot'' of useful and well-written information. It needs some high-level rearrangements and someone who knows a lot about this to read it start to finish and make corrections. Right now, I don't think it qualifies for GA standards. --[[User:Zvika|Zvika]] 14:09, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

== Schematic symbols not appropriate ==

Opening an electrotechnology article with a schematic symbol is not useful - anyone who knows electrical schematics will already know the symbols, and someone seeking general knowledge of a topic will only be baffled by the non-physical representation inherent in a schematic symbol. Even worse, North American and European conventions differ for some schematic symbols. Use schematic symbols only if they are critical to explanation and if you can't use a simpler block-diagram format that requires minimal prior knowledge to understand. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 02:50, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

== efficiency ==

Currently the article claims
"Secondary batteries always yield less energy than was used to charge them... However, modern lithium designs have almost negated this wastage as they can have efficiencies of around 99%.[46]"

The reference given [http://www.batteryuniversity.com/partone-12.htm] does back up this claim:
"Charging lithium-ion batteries ... The charge efficiency is 99.9% and the battery remains cool during charge."

However, I am still skeptical.
I suspect that what I would call the "efficiency" (the total energy I get out of a battery, divided by the total energy I put into the battery) is much less than 99.9 percent.

So is my intuition wrong, and Li-ion batteries really are this amazingly wonderful?
Or is the efficiency mentioned really measuring something else --
perhaps:
* "The coulombic efficiency of battery [is] the ratio of the number of charges that enter the battery during charging compared to the number that can be extracted from the battery during discharging."[http://www.udel.edu/igert/pvcdrom/BATTERY/effic.htm]?
* "voltage efficiency"?

The best one can hope to achieve is the same charge out as went in. To achieve 99% efficiency then the difference between V_charge and V_discharge would have to be just 1%, as well as leakage being zero. That sure is asking a lot.

Battery (electricity) is the only article on batteries that has more than 5kb. all the rest are only stub articles. When someone says battery, they are referring to an electrical battery more than 99% of the time. [[Battery]] disambiguation should be moved to [[Battery (disambiguation)]].

In most developed countries, lawyers, police officers, and military personnel each make up less than 1% of the population. I say the balance of numbers makes the electrical meaning of battery overwhelmingly dominant across the population as a whole.

:(od) '''Comment''' – Binksternet, the point is that there is one meaning (electrical) which is [[WP:PRIMARYUSAGE|primary]] because the number of users familiar with it massively outnumbers the users of any of the other meanings. The electrical meaning is in common use by the ''entire'' population. The other meanings are in common use only by relatively few people working in the respective specialisms: lawyers, police officers, and military personnel. Consider that "salt" has at least three different meanings, but we don't insist on having a dab page for it; we just have [[Salt]], and {{tl|dablink}} at the top. That solution would work fine for [[Battery]] - [[User:Neparis|Neparis]] ([[User talk:Neparis|talk]]) 02:26, 19 March 2008 (UTC) 

'''Oppose''', per many of the arguments above. Article length is not an indicator of importance. There are too many notable uses for "battery" to use the un-disambiguated space for one of them.

== problems with battery article ==

I have occasionally added historical and scientific entries about batteries, typically in the mode of adding to rather than replacing existing material.  I have not looked at this article for many months, but there seems to be a significant removal of history (speculation about Baghdad batteries in place of well-founded information about Galvani) and removal of scientific information about charge storage (Amp-hrs) and current (Amp) associated with a battery.  In its place seems to be more technical information (e.g., different types of batteries).  I'm fine with more info about battery types, but not with removal of the other info.  There has got to be room for both the scientific and the technical.  There is a need for an editor to take control of various subsections, to decide what should be kept, and then find out who did the good writing and lock out others.  In many ways this article has gone downhill in the past year.[[User:WMSwiki|WMSwiki]] ([[User talk:WMSwiki|talk]]) 01:47, 5 May 2008 (UTC)

My wall clock died and when I replaced the AA battery I found the negative terminal was covered in a yellow-tinged white mineral deposit, perhaps a crystallization of some sort.  I am curious what the corrosion is chemically and why it occurred in this dead battery and not in others.
I read a few internet forums and most of the wiki article on batteries I didn’t find a link to anything that explained white corrosion in the chemical section.  I suggest that the article is slightly focused on an industrial perspective of batteries and could be more encyclopedic if it also connected with Wikipedia's body of chemical knowledge.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Pstaight|Pstaight]] ([[User talk:Pstaight|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pstaight|contribs]]) 15:44, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
Following "also see" -> "Alkaline battery" -> "leak" I found that the white corrosion is probably potassium hydroxide and I'm assuming it was caused by a manufacturer defect.

Not moved [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 06:59, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

[[:Battery (electricity)]] → [[Electrochemical battery]] — I request to move the article to electrochemical battery (page was moved a few days ago to this name, but was reverted as it is considered a controversial move). As there is already the article electrochemical cell, and a battery (in electricity) is simply a combination of these, it is only appropriate to move it here (article coherence). Also, a [[battery]] on itself could mean a variety of things (eg gun battery, ...) thus the "electrochemical" is crucial is this differs the article from the other "batteries" Electrochemical battery is btw not a "popular term", but no one would find battery (electricity) a popular term neither (I wouldn't think anyone would search for the article with this term)

== Lead acid batteries ==

"The lead-acid battery is also very heavy for the amount of electrical energy it can supply"

This is misleading at best.  Whether you measure the amount of power over time, or the amount of current in a short time, the lead-acid battery is NOT 'very heavy' for its energy output.
The only batteries that can put out comparable or greater electricity in the same weight and size are NiMh and Li-ion, the latter of which is still only experimental.
The other battery types can not put out the bulk power of lead-acid batteries, so quoting their energy density is misleading.

The tables on batteries are quite inaccurate.
For instance, lead acid batteries are said to be 'moderately expensive' while NiMh, NiZn, and NiCd batteries are said to be 'inexpensive'.  They are decidly NOT inexpensive, they are all much more expensive than lead acid batteries.
In the lead acid section it says they are inexpensive !

The batteries conatining Nickel produce large amounts of toxic materials in their construction, the table infers that they have no toxic properties.[[Special:Contributions/203.26.122.12|203.26.122.12]] ([[User talk:203.26.122.12|talk]]) 05:18, 1 December 2009 (UTC)

:A battery is an electrical/electrolytic circuit consisting in 1 or more electrochemical energy producing cells. And they all have 5 essential constituent ingredients. 2 of these are the electrochemical energy powered EMF voltages. 2 more are electrical resistance networks related to the transfer of the electrons into and out of (and within) the cell electrical circuits. And the fifth is an electrolytic ion motion of flow of the ions in the electrolyte in the direction of the dominant EMF voltage gradient. Since the primary purpose of a battery is to supply electrical energy to an electrical load, these constituents may be considered to be the following listing of a series connected electrical entities:
      1 A dominating negative electromotive EMF (at the point of electrochemical activity)
      2 The electrical resistance of the negative anode circuit
      3 The flow velocity of the ions within the electrolytic circuit
      4 The usually counter EMF voltage at the point of electrochemical activity within the cathode
      5 The electrical resistance of the cathode circuit
These constituents work together to provide the composite battery unit with an electrical energy power and energy supply characteristic intended to meet a certain set of specified electrical power and energy load requirements.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 00:00, 9 March 2013 (UTC)

== Proposed article name change: 'Battery (electricity)' to only 'Battery' ==
{{discussion-top}}
The most common popular usage of'' 'battery' ''in Wikipedia, by far, is for this article on the electrical battery, with the legal and military definitions trailing in that order, as listed on the 'Battery (disambiguation)' page.

This article is a highly read page, with more than 116,028 pageviews last month -the figure likely being over 123K pageviews since the server didn't record two days worth of data.  That volume of readership compares with the second place 'Battery (crime)' figure of approx. 16,777 views,  and the third place article 'Battery (military)' of approximately only 27 pageviews.

Since the second and third place articles combined amount to less than 15% of the readership of the electrical battery article, it would be preferable, i.m.h.o., to rename this article to plain 'ol ''Battery'', with a corresponding renaming of the disambiguation page'' 'Battery' ''to'' 'Battery (disambiguation)'.''  The net result of such an article name change would be to make this article's webpage more quickly accessible to the casual viewers seeking information on electrical batteries (approximately 85% of the total pageviews for all 'battery' articles).  The tophat note would also be revised to include some extra elaboration for the legal and military articles.

Prior to posting a formal name change proposition tag on this article's page, a survey of regular editors to capture opinions and or other comments would be helpful.  Best: [[User:Harryzilber|HarryZilber]] ([[User talk:Harryzilber|talk]]) 15:03, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

== Rating? Why mAh not Wh? ==

Why are batteries almost always rated in current-hours -- [[mAh]], not power -- [[Wh]] or [[joules]]? I can always multiply volts by mAh to get mWh, but why is current-time the standard? I assume it is somehow a more reliable measure (maybe at low temperature the voltage drops but the number of electrons ready to flow doesn't?) The fact that "Watt" doesn't appear on this page tells me that there is some fundamental reason Watts just don't make sense for batteries. [[User:BenFrantzDale|—Ben FrantzDale]] ([[User talk:BenFrantzDale|talk]]) 14:00, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

::First note that these are two different units. Amperes (A) is coulumbs of charge (C) per second (t), A = C / t. Thus mAh is essentially a measure of charge, or coulombs. Watts (W) is joules of energy (J) per second (t), W = J / t, thus Wh is essentially energy, or joules. But to answer your question, because batteries primarily store charge and not energy.

::::{{replyto|BenFrantzDale}} {{replyto|Randy Yates}} {{replyto|86.144.90.137}} It is wrong to say that "batteries primarily store charge and not energy". It is the opposite. Energy is one of the most fundamental concepts in science. Basically, everything has energy. Charge, on the other hand, is a way to understand and explain energy in certain physical interactions, like in electricity (electric field, electrostatics, electrochemistry). In general, "charge" is a measure of energy. The more charge you can store, the more energy. They are proportional. As to why in batteries Ah is used. It may have to do with the practical aspects of charging and discharging. A battery of 50 Ah can be discharged in one hour by using a current of 50 A. So, if I have a device that consumes 5 A, a battery of 50 Ah will power it for 10 hours. I guess it is simpler to understand it this way, because we can measure current with ammeters and clamps, instead of knowing exactly how much energy (Wh) this device will need for a certain period of time.----[[Special:Contributions/137.132.22.190|137.132.22.190]] ([[User talk:137.132.22.190|talk]]) 02:26, 4 August 2014 (UTC)

* The assertion that "electrical battery" is the common name is quite plainly false. There's nothing wrong with parentheses where there's a very obvious common name which requires them.

*'''More comments'''
:*Having looked up Britannica (1965), I find, as expected, that the only article under battery is the electrical battery (and types, such as atomic).  I'd have preferred to move this article to "Battery" as it is the primary topic in modern popular usage, but I accepted the previous discussion that went against that proposal [[Talk:Battery_(electricity)/Archive_1#Proposed_move|March 2006]], [[Talk:Battery_(electricity)/Archive_1#Requested_move|March 2008]].  Personally, I note that the word derives from a broader meaning (something like "similar things that are used similarly, with force", whether a battery of punches used in battering someone, a coordinated assault, a group of large guns to be used in a coordinated assault, or an array of cells used together additively to produce a significant electromotive force).
:*I dislike parentheses because they are not usually used in professional publications where a more accurate title can equally be used.  Apparently not everyone dislikes parentheses.  In essence, this move comes downs to a preference concerning parentheses.  If we must stick with parentheses, I would prefer "Battery (electrical)".
:*Noting [[user:thumperward|Chris]]' objection, the equivalent of a definitive official title to use would come from the first description of the device, by Benjamin Franklin, which is the "electrical battery".  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 04:56, 19 July 2010 (UTC)
*'''Further Comment''': I believe there's significant interest in the proposal to change the current title 'Battery (electricity)' to the prime topic 'Battery', and move the disambiguation page to 'Battery (disambiguation)'.  Although some areas of the world might refer to an 'electrical battery' in the first instance of mention, the use of the plain 'battery' appears by far the most popular usage worldwide.  A quick Google check shows only 1.2M usages of "assault and battery", and only 32,000 usages of "criminal battery", versus about 140M usages or so of battery as an electrical component -which occupies the top ten results (not counting a news item).  Yes, Google checks are non-binding on these discussions, but they're a good reality check for what's used on the web.  While some might prefer more technical terms such as 'Electrochemical battery', I believe most interested editors would be able to live with the plain 'Battery' for the primary topic, accompanied by the normal hatnotes and disambiguation page. I would urge editors to allow this change (to just 'Battery') to move ahead and improve the title on what's plainly a highly viewed article on Wikipedia.

*'''Comment'''<s>'''Oppose'''</s>It is utterly and demonstrably incorrect to claim that "Electrical battery"  was the term used initially for a device which creates electric current electrochemically.

"Electrical battery" still meant either device in [http://books.google.com/books?id=nsq7-aMapz4C&pg=PA613&dq=pile+%22electrical+battery%22&hl=en&ei=qkxLTMuDM5KlnQe6woGwDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pile%20%22electrical%20battery%22&f=false 1859] and in textbooks many years thereafter.

== Introduction:  enlarging the initial definition to include one-cell devices like the AA battery ==

Since most batteries now in use have only a single electrochemical cell (e.g. AA or C batteries, as opposed to the multi-cell 9 volt battery or the 6-cell 12 volt car battery) I have changed the first sentence to say, 

"An electrical battery is device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells used..."

The history section further down explains this current meaning, and how it arose despite the original sense of battery as a multi-cell device like the voltaic pile.[[User:CharlesHBennett|CharlesHBennett]] ([[User talk:CharlesHBennett|talk]]) 22:05, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

: I restored the more than one cell as the primary definition: dry cells, AA cell, 9V battery, car battery, and laptop battery. I don't believe the distinction should disappear right now, but others can weigh in. [[User:Glrx|Glrx]] ([[User talk:Glrx|talk]]) 01:20, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

:: It looks rather stupid for an encyclopedia article to say "An X is only yin. X also includes yang." If I walked into my local [[Canadian Tire]] and asked for a dry cell, I'd probably be put in the room they use to hold shoplifters. Everybody calls that AA or D thing a "battery" and it serves no encyclopediac purpose to be more pedantic than the world.Is the purpose of an encyclopedia article to show how much smarter we editors are than the great unwashed, or is the purpose to provide (as neutrally and verifiably as this Rube Goldberg process can) the facts? If anyone with even less life than I thinks the distinction between 1 cell and many cells is that important, research it and show how the usuage has changed since the 17th century.  --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 13:51, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

== Principles of Operation ==

This section seems a bit esoteric.  My eyes started crossing almost immediately.  I was surprised that several concepts I expected to see were not there.  So, here is my thoughts:
I have a bit of trouble with the first sentence; converting chemical energy directly to electrical energy.
Not that it isn't true, but it isn't clear to me what that means.  "Chemical energy" seems way too abstract, and in point of fact, it is a specific kind of chemical energy that is used.  So, the term is too general and not useful.  Also, while there is a lot said about the two half-cells (separation, etc. etc.), the point is not made that a battery works by separating a spontaneous redox (chemical) reaction into two halves and forces the electrons to flow through an electrical circuit to complete the reaction rather than what they would normally do (react "directly"with , "flowing directly" from oxidant to reductant (ignoring solvation shells, etc.)).
A battery harnesses the energy of the chemical changes to do work by putting the work in between the two half-cells.  Perhaps this is just my chemical background, but it just seems more intuitive than to talk about half-cell reactions.  I was also surprised that the word "ion" was not explained, nor electrolyte.  Perhaps there is just too much introductory material I am expecting, but it seems that it is less important that the reader know the name of a negative ion (anion) than they know that the ions carry the electrons which do the work.
How about this proposal: "A battery is a device that converts the energy of a redox reaction directly to electrical energy. A redox reaction is a chemical reaction in which one chemical loses electrons (the oxidant) and one gains them (the reducer). A battery works by separating the oxidizer and reducer into two parts (half-cells) and forces the electrons lost by the oxidant to move through an electrical circuit (and do work) in order to get to the reducer and so complete the chemical reaction."  Since the article does not allow editing, I leave this as a proposal. Does it help ?[[Special:Contributions/173.189.75.206|173.189.75.206]] ([[User talk:173.189.75.206|talk]]) 17:00, 5 March 2013 (UTC)
:If you register a pseudonym, you can edit. Aren't all chemical reactions "redox" reactions?  Is "chemical" energy a really esoteric concept that needs much amplification here? We can talk about ions and redox and such later on in the article as necessary. If you have to define " a 'foo' is a 'bar baz grault'" in the first use of a term, it's probably too dense and should be rewritten to give the reader a better run at the concept. We don't want the readers' eyes to glaze over before they've even found out what is in the article. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 17:57, 5 March 2013 (UTC)

:An easy method of telling charged batteries from discharged batteries is of no practical use?  Call me Mr Skeptical, but I didn't believe it.  Snopes claims it is an urban myth.  So I decided to try it, and to my astonishment, the batteries behave exactly as shown in the video.  I even tried it with AA and AAA size batteries and it still works.  I found a few forums where people tried to explain the reason with one 'genius' claiming that the batteries loose electrolyte as they discharge and therfore become lighter.  Apart from the fact that he totally failed to explain where this mass disappears to, the electrolyte takes no part in the reaction of an alkaline battery. We can't put this in the article of course, because this is just [[WP:OR|original research]] at present.  But the difference is so marked that it must be documented somewhere.

The lay person may refer to a battery as one or more cells but this is not the correct definition. This author gives one of the better explanations that I have seen http://www.gcsescience.com/pe1.htm. If you had two sets of cells in parallel this would be two different batteries and this is why I only described a battery as cells connected in series. The current trend in physics (and more specifically electricity) is that a battery is multiple cells in series and I think it is important that Wikipedia reflects the status quo in this field.

I propose this as the opening paragraph as it explains both sides of the argument:

"A battery is a device consisting of two or more electrochemical cells connected in series. However, in every-day usage a single cell is often also referred to as a battery. Each cell contains a positive terminal called a cathode and a negative terminal called an anode. Electrolytes move through the internal circuit to balance the build up of charge which allows electrons to continuously flow through the external circuit and perform work."  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/124.190.92.221|124.190.92.221]] ([[User talk:124.190.92.221|talk]]) 05:12, 14 September 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Sorry, I have limited energy, but am almost certain that lead-acid chemistry was not the first to be used. Text should be corrected. Iirc, electric cars, ca. 1900, used nickel-iron batteries, iirc invented by Thomas Edison. (They were preferred, especially by women at the time, to gasoline-engine cars.)

As well, quite-old (early 20th C.) railroad signal systems using relays and rechargeable batteries probably used NiFe chemistry. Very likely that they did not release hydrogen when charged. Right in the center of Waltham, Mass, is a  small windowed building containing relays and rechargeable batteries. Unlit, one can see what's inside, but not well.

I seem to recall an old trademark comprising "NiFe" as its primary graphic element, found in old industrial magazines, but not sure. It must have promoted NiFe batteries.

÷×÷×÷×÷

Sorry, but I think the introductory text needs rewriting in terms more commonly understood.

Regarding "piles", Spanish uses the term "pilas" as we use "batteries".

Also regarding the term, I once read that early infrared-to-visible image converter tubes of WW II vintage operated on DC in perhaps the 1 kV range, roughly, but presumably in the μA or nA range. Their power came from stacks of hundreds or maybe a few thousands of layers of iirc copper and zinc foil discs separated by paper discs. Apparently, no explicit electrolyte was added, nor extra moisture. Whether the stack was compressed, I don't know. The Zamboni pile comes to mind.

These tubes comprised an IR photocathode, iirc close to a green phosphor screen, and were used at night. Focus as such didn't exist, and close proximity sufficed. Decades ago, they were readily available on the surplus market.

Below is the first paragraph of the topic.

An electric battery is a device consisting of two or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. Each cell has a positive terminal, or cathode, and a negative terminal, or anode. The terminal marked positive is at a higher electrical potential energy than is the terminal marked negative. The terminal marked positive is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device. 

The fourth sentence must be corrected to "The terminal marked '''negative''' is the source of electrons..."

== Anode is the source of high potential electrons and is labeled with a positive sign ==

We have a problem here with this article. It seems that some people are reverting well sourced material from the article based on their wrong headed ideas of how batteries work rather on published sources. If you would take the time to read a good chemistry or physics text you will find that those sources say explicitly that electrons originate at high potential at the anode (marked with a positive sign), they then flow through an external circuit performing work, and then they return to the cathode (marked with a negative sign) of the battery at zero potential. The source of confusion enters when physicists and chemists append labels to sketches of batteries and their circuits. The high potential anode is always labeled with a positive sign (indicating higher potential to perform work) and the low potential terminal is marked with a negative sign (indicating lower potential). While the electrons are negatively charged and originate at the anode, the positive sign is appended to that terminal to indicate that it is the source of high potential energy electrons. I will now quote from one of the sources I have on my desk.

From Chemistry, 2nd edition, by Raymond Chang page 533: ''By definition, the electrode at which the oxidation occurs, is called the '''anode'''; the electrode at which the reduction occurs, is called the '''cathode'''.'' Bold emphasis is the author's.

On that same page figure 19.1 : ''Cell diagram of a galvanic cell. The Zn and Cu electrodes are immersed in ZnCuSO<sub>4</sub>, and CuSO<sub>4</sub> solutions, respectively. The function of the salt bridge (the inverted U tube) is to provide an electrically conducting medium between the ZnCuSO<sub>4</sub>, and CuSO<sub>4</sub> solutions. It consists of an inert electrolyte solution (such as KCl solution). The opening of the U tube are lightly filled with cotton swabs to prevent the KCl solution from running into the containers, while allowing the anions and the cations to move across. '''Electrons flow externally from the Zn electrode (anode) to the copper electrode (cathode).''' '' The bold emphasis is mine.

In addition to that, I have another chemistry text and several physics and electrical engineering sources on my desk that explicitly express the idea that the electrons flow from the terminal marked + (positive) through a passive device such as a resistor where they perform work, to the terminal marked - (negative). Batteries are marked with a positive sign and the simple circuits illustrated explicitly show the electrons flowing from that terminal through the external circuit to the terminal marked negative. Unless you are prepared to argue with published sources written by people with PhDs in chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering, I suggest you accept their sign convention. I will revert the reversion once again and bring in other people if necessary, but I assure you that you are wasting everyone's time. [[User:Zedshort|Zedshort]] ([[User talk:Zedshort|talk]]) 13:17, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

As the sources on my desk may not be common, I will provide an online source.

On page 180 of this online source: https://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/intro_physics_2/intro_physics_2.a4.pdf

Beginning of quote from that source:

<blockquote>A lead-acid battery consists of two plates. The anode (positive pole) is made out of ordinary
lead. The cathode (negative pole) is made of lead coated with lead oxide. Both are immersed in a
solution of water and sulphuric acid. At the anode :

  Pb + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> → PbSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup>

while at the cathode:

  PbO<sub>2</sub>+ HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + 3H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> → PbSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

or overall:

  Pb + PbO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  → 2PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</blockquote>

End of quote.

Note that the anode is supplied high potential electrons by the reaction that takes place there. When an external path is supplied, the reaction progresses as electrons move through the external circuit, while internally the cations that originate at the anion flow to the cathode. The electrons pass through an external load, lose their potential energy and finally join the cations at the cathode. The chemical reaction continues until the chemical potential of the battery is used up. The author explicitly states that the anode is marked positive and the anode is marked negative.

::The source I referenced also has such an unfortunately and mistakenly labeled illustration. Now what? How does one go about making a decision as to what to believe and what to use to write this article? In addition to that silly illustration, which incidentally shows the battery as an open circuit suggestion the accumulation of a few electrons on the anode and hence does not really counter the text, there are a dozen other pages of illustrations and detailed text that consistently states the opposite and there are all my electrical engineering texts, and physics texts that say otherwise.

::: The online source you gave, under the heading of ''Symbol for a battery'' says "the + sign (and longer plate) indicate the anode, the side of the battery from which positive current flows (where we are suffering from Franklin’s Mistake, because the actual motion of charge in the chemical reaction above is negative electrons flowing the other way)." However, it still agrees with the convention that electrons are emitted from the electrode with the negative sign and absorbed at the electrode with the positive side.  Also, if you look at the equation that you gave above for the anode
::::Pb + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> → PbSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup>

:::The terminal that gives up electrons is the negative terminal. Electrons are negatively charged. Nominal current direction is the opposite of direction of electron flow. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 20:03, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

::::Here is the problem. While people may call the terminal that gives up the electrons the negative terminal, it is more appropriate from the standpoint of Potential Energy to say that terminal (the anode) is the source of high potential energy electrons. In physics texts the anode of a battery or a generator is marked with a positive sign indicating a higher potential. Check any physics reference. The terminal on the batteries you have at home are marked positive and are the anode and the source of high potential electrons. While the electrons are negative charge, they do not leave the anode and move toward the cathode until connected to an external circuit. From the anode, they flow through an external circuit, losing their potential to do work, they flow from there with virtually zero energy left to the cathode where they combine with the cations that have gathered there. Hence the circuit is complete.

::::I have no clue as to what this means: "Nominal current direction is the opposite of direction of electron flow." Do you have a source for this? I understand that the electrons will flow in a direction opposite the electrical potential since the flow from the high potential anode to the low potential cathode. Perhaps that is what you meant. 
:::::There are two issues to address in your comment.  I’ll address the easy one.  I’m sure Vquakr meant ''conventional'' current when he said ''normal'' current.  If you see a schematic with a battery and a load, it is conventional to show current as an arrow coming out of the positive terminal through the load and back to the negative terminal.  That would be the conventional current.  The electron current flows in the opposite direction (from the negative terminal of the battery to the load and then to the positive terminal of the battery.) That is the convention.  It has always been that way.  [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 20:39, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

::::::You are correct then you say the electrons flow from the terminal marked  + (typically found in the physics and electrical engineering texts) through the load and to the terminal marked negative. With that, I will say that we are making progress. But, what you say here: "The electron current flows in the opposite direction..." makes no sense. The direction of current flow is opposite the potential energy increase direction, afterall, the elecrons will only flow "down hill" in a potential sense. You are confusing the direction of increasing electrical potential with the current flow direction. The electrons flow from high potential anode (marked +) to the load where they lose their energy, and finally end of that they end at the cathode (marked -). The direction of increasing electrical '''potential is in the direction opposite the current flow,''' that is why the electrons flow and deliver their energy to the load that stands between the anode and the cathode.
:::::::You might find this helpful [[Electric current#Conventions]]. It explains the difference between conventional current and electron current. [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 20:30, 10 May 2016 (UTC)
 
:::::The second issue is that there are no high potential electrons involved.  Electrons guide electromagnetic energy to the load, but they don’t carry it to the load as potential energy.  Energy flows to the load via the electromagnetic field surrounding the conductors from ''both'' terminals of the battery.

:::::Can you describe what you mean by "high potential energy electrons"? In this context that is a meaningless phrase. [[Electric potential]] is environment-dependent. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 20:41, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

::::::In order for work to be performed, the electrons must be higher in electrical potential than the point to which they will flow. As those electrons flow from the high potential, through a load they give up their potential energy. In the case of their flowing through a resistance, that Potential Energy will manifests as heat. If the potential was delivered to a flywheel, the energy would manifest as rotational kinetic energy, nevertheless, those electrons would loose their potential to do work. A battery delivers high potential energy electrons to an external circuit from the anode to the load, and they end at the cathode where they join the cations within the battery, completing the circuit. The idea of a potential energy, whether in the form of a gravitational potential energy, or chemical potential energy, or an electrical potential energy is nothing new. Electrical potential is indeed environment dependent, and in the case of the battery attached to a load, the battery anode is the high energy source (high potential), the load receives that energy, and the electrons return to the cathode with zero potential. The flow of electrons is in the direction opposite to the Potential increase. [[User:Zedshort|Zedshort]] ([[User talk:Zedshort|talk]]) 21:04, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

:::::::You are poorly differentiating electric charge, electric potential, current, and energy. For example, the electrical potential at the cathode is only zero ''if measured in reference to the cathode''. We agree, though, that in a discharging battery electrons leave the anode (negative terminal) and return to the cathode (positive terminal). You just have the nomenclature backwards. In an electrolytic cell (example: a recharging battery), the positive terminal becomes the anode and the negative terminal the cathode, because electrons always flow from the anode (site of oxidation) to the cathode (site of reduction). In terms of references, I seem to have misplaced my intro gen chem book from college. My current citation is the MCAT chemistry handbook (pp 313-314), which I concede is not an exemplary source. I'll grab a more authoritative text next time I'm at the library. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 22:37, 9 May 2016 (UTC)

{{outdent}}
Put the battery in a black box and have the two terminals come outside the "device".

A battery / electrochemical cell has unambiguous positive and negative terminals. One of the terminals has a higher potential/voltage than the other. A voltmeter can be used to label the positive and negative terminals coming out of the black box. To first order, the voltage across a battery does not change.

The terms [[anode]] and [[cathode]] distinguish the direction of (conventional) current. If the black box terminals are not connected to anything, then there is no anode or cathode because there is no current into or out of the device.

The mnemonics are CCD ("cathode current departs" the device) and ACID ("anode current into device").

When a battery is discharged (providing current), conventional current departs from the cathode and flows into the anode: the conventional current is from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.  The positive terminal is the cathode and the negative terminal is the anode.

Here, current means conventional current. As pointed out above, the negative charge of an electron means the electron flow is opposite to the conventional current. The electron flow is opposite to conventional charge flow: electrons depart from the anode and enter through the cathode.

See [[Galvanic cell]].

For secondary batteries, the role of the positive and negative terminals changes when the battery is charged. During charging, the positive terminal is the anode and the negative terminal is the anode.

== Largest Batteries ==

The article suggests that the largest batteries are in backup power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers.  I wonder if those are truly the largest batteries.

:Interesting question.  Tesla just announced a 100 MW, 126 MWH battery project for Australia, and I bet that's bigger than any submarine battery. This is claimed to be 3 times the size of any other utility grid-connected battery. Looking at the article on the GUPPY conversions in the US Navy, looks like peak power was on the order of 5 MW or so, much smaller than many utility-connected batteries.

== Add Lithium Polymer battery, aka LiPo battery ==

Please add LiPo battery to the page.  They typically power consumer drones, aka UASs.  I believe a LiPo battery is very closely related to the Lithium Ion battery.  I know the modern LiPo can hold as much as a 3.8 volt nominal charge per cell.  

Also, it would be nice if there was a short discussion on exactly what "nominal" means as it is used with "nominal voltage", "nominal capacity", etc.  For example, if I check my 12-volt car battery, it might show 13.5 volts.  If I fully charge my 11.1 nominal capacity (3 cell) drone battery, it shows 12.6 volts.  A more modern 4 cell LiPo has a nominal capacity of 15.2 volts, but will show close to 17.2 volts fully charged.

== Is 1.5 V really the maximum theoretical voltage for alkaline? ==

[[Battery_%28electricity%29#Chemistry|Alkaline (zinc–manganese dioxide) is listed as having 1.5 V as the maximum theoretical voltage]]. Is that really true?

I have just measured a Duracell AA battery marked with "ALKALINE"/"DURALOCK"/"MN1500"/"1.5 V LR6" (most likely [https://www.duracell.com/en-us/product/coppertop-battery "Coppertop"]) with a Fluke 175 multimeter (with a fresh 9 V battery) to 1.624&nbsp;V. This was confirmed by using another multimeter (within about 0.2%, 0.003 V).

Measuring 20 other batteries from three other manufacturers (all marked with "Alkaline" or "ALKALINE") gave results in the range  1.609 - 1.621&nbsp;V.

== electromotive force falls under discharge ==

The article states that an ideal cell would maintain its electromotive force (emf) under discharge until exhausted at which the emf drops to zero. This ideal emf is determined by conditions at the atomic level. We know that the emf of a car battery drops under discharge and this is hard to understand. The physical chemistry of a non-ideal cell should be explained in this article or some reference to the explanation should be given. As it stands the article seems to say that the laws of physics make a prediction which turns out to be wrong in the real world - as though there were any other.
