== Informatics Practices ==

This seems to be a practical informatics syllabus for the Indian exam system rather than a field of computer science. Personally I don't think it should be listed as a field on the main article, but just asking if there is any justification for its current inclusion here.  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 18:23, 5 December 2018 (UTC)

I agree that this is not a field of computer science.
To make matters worse to my eyes, it uses IP right after information practices ignoring what [[Internet Protocol|IP]] means essentially everywhere in computer science. Also, it uses course and field as synonyms in "The course mainly covers coding, software and networking concepts. This field is (...)", which makes almost no sense. [[User:BernardoSulzbach|BernardoSulzbach]] ([[User talk:BernardoSulzbach|talk]]) 19:16, 5 December 2018 (UTC)

: Completely agree the wording also makes it unclear whether it is talking about a particular course or a subject ''(the former of which has no place on a general article in my opinion)''. However even if the wording were cleaned up, I don't think it'd solve the underlying problem  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 21:33, 5 December 2018 (UTC)

:: Seeing as there seems to be no disagreement on this, I have removed this section. If you feel it should be added back in, feel free to continue the discussion  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 10:39, 24 December 2018 (UTC)

== Def. of CS; Relation to engineering ==

Here is the previous definition: 
:'''Computer science''' (informally, '''CS''', '''CSC''' or '''compsci''') is, in its most general sense, the study of [[computation]] and [[information processing]], both in [[computer hardware|hardware]] and in [[software]]. 

I felt it focused on the study of the knowledge rather than focus on the knowledge that is produced by the science.  The previous definition generally worked for the academic domain, but it didn't work for the application of the science.  - [[User:Jhballard|Jhballard]] 18:14, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

----

Perhaps [http://www.math-atlas.org/index/index.html the math atlas] may be used in some way to group subfields. Other suggestions are welcome -- HJH

----
:''Computer science is a new science; only in the last 20 years has it begun to develop the benchmarks of the more mature sciences. ''
I don't think it is a science since it doesn't employ the [[:scientific method|scientific method]]. Also, maybe we should mention the roots in electrical engineering, mathematics and linguistics. The 20 year number seems much to low. How about

:''Computer science is a relatively new field with roots in electrical engineering, mathematics and linguistics. Only in the last third of the twentieth century has it begun to be recognized as a separate discipline and developed its own methods and terminology.'' 

The first computer science department was founded at [[Purdue University]] in 1962.

-- I think it's a valuable change. -- HJH

::But computer science ''does'' use the scientific method.  A computer scientist:
::# Develops a hypothesis about a particular way of organizing systems, or solving a given computational problem;
::# Devises an experiment (typically involving the construction of a computational artifact) that tests this hypothesis; and
::# Evaluates the results by comparing its behavior with that of other, previously known computational artifacts (controls).
::The fact that the phenomena that the computer scientist studies are usually human constructions, or that much of the analysis can be done using mathematical instruments rather than physical ones, does not make this less scientific. --[[User:K.lee|k.lee]]

----
The first line seems misleading. Computer science seems to me to be much more about the design of ''programs'' than ''computers''; the latter is [[computer engineering]]. I wouldn't isolate the two entirely, but making "the design ... of computers" the first point in this article seems to lead it off in the wrong direction.  --FOo

----
The distinction between science and engineering is not made clear in the topic page.  The delicate interplay between hardware and software is not given enough emphasis.  There is no mention of artificial intelligence as the foundation for the enthusiasm that we have for computers.  And I find it difficult to view things like "operating systems" under the "Algorithms" heading.

How do we fix all this?  Do we make one small change after the other?  Or do I rewrite the entire page?

[[User:Randal Leavitt|Randal Leavitt]] 02:18 Oct 6, 2002 (UTC)

:Randall, the page is basically a list of subdisciplines.  I think that part of the page is OK, myself (though there's always room to argue about subclassifications).  Where I agree the page is lacking is in providing an overview, and you can certainly add/rewrite without upsetting too many people there.  Overviews are extremely hard to write, and be prepared for some discussion before the article settles down into an acceptable form. --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]

Computer Science is the science of computing.  What can computation do?  What problems can be solved by computation and in fac[t require computation rather than one evaluation of a single mathematical formula?  How can unsolvable problems be proved unsolvable?  For solvable problems, how can they be solved (algorithms), and what is the minimum in resources (time and space) needed?  The answers to these questions form the basis of the field of Computer Science.

Certainly, Computer Science is a very new field with much interaction with mathematics and electrical engineering where it started, but it arose as a discipline because the problems of computation were not properly in the scope of the other two fields, and became separate as this fact became apparent.  An example of this is the Fast Fourier Transform.  Fourier Transforms have been known in mathematics since the 19th century, but the idea of performing them in a systematic fashion so that they could be done Fast is a very 20th century Computer Science idea.  There is a certain feedback, too-- iterative computational methods such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel for solving matrix problems have in turn allowed mathematicians to probe their discipline more deeply, which then leads back to computational notions about matrices such as "ill-conditioned" or "tridiagonal", such that it can become hard to draw a line between the two disciplines.  At this time, Software Engineering is part of Computer Science, but may split off, and Management Information Systems, which is more concerned with exactly what it is called, "management of information", is closely related, databases being of concern to both disciplines.  A good write up on Computer Science, I feel, should make distinctions between these closely related subjects.

Brenton Chapin

:Interesting points.  Why don't you have a go at writing it up? --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]

----

Computer science is the study of both computers and software. Today, the
main emphasis is on software, however, computer hardware implements
algorithms, and it has correctness issues, just like software.
All computer engineers must learn some computer science.

Computer science is much more than programming languages and algorithms.
It is the study of what is possible with computers and software.

The von Neumann machine is the most common architecture available
to buy, today. However, CS explores the possiblities of all kinds
of architectures, including random and parallel machines.

----

And just what is a "random" machine anyway?
Presumably someone knows; searching for this on google isn't helping,
so *please*, someone, at least add an external link. I'll do the writeup
myself, but I need some material.

----

IS/IT/MIS are all about operations. MIS is particularly about financial
and business operations, however IS/IT are much broader.

----

The lists at the bottom of this page are much more like a list
of basic concepts, than an artidle. Real content would be nice.

Removed this line. See [[Software engineering]] for a discussion
of the relationship between software engineering and traditional engineering.

== List of  &#8220;Leading Computer Scientists&#8221; ==

This remarkably short list needs some serious updating for its glaring omission of contributors of historical stature.   If you want to cite Gene Golub and Edsger Dijkstra, the following additions would be in order: 

*  Konrad Zuse, builder of the first binary computer in the 1930s, for which he devised a programming language well ahead of its times.

*  Alston Householder, for his contributions to the field of matrix computations. [see more on Householder in the MacTutor Biographies]

*  John Backus, for the invention of FORTRAN, the first practical high-level programming language.

*  James Wilkinson, for the technique of &#8220;backward error analysis&#8221; and advances in the field of matrix computations.  Wilkinson was also a principal mover in the development of the Pilot ACE, the first British computer, in the late 1940s. [see more on Wilkinson in the MacTutor Biographies]

*  Kenneth Iverson, inventor of APL, for his contribution to interactive computing.

*  James Cooley and John Tuckey, for the Fast Fourier Transform and its impact on scientific research..

*  William Kahan, for the IEEE floating-point standard.

** Who else would you add?

* I took a liberty to rename the section into "Prominent Names in Computer Science" and I suggest the following criteria for putting names into the list, namely, the '''Pioneering''' criteria.

::(1) The person is famous for the contribution that dramatically changed the scope and essence of the Computer Science as a whole. 
:::Examples:
:::Backus passes this test, Ivrson doesn't (based on the listed reasons)
:::Alan Housholder must be moved into the page of "Prominent Namies in Matrix Computations" or similar.
::(2) However insignificant, the person was world's first in something fundamental to Computer Science.
::: Based on this criterion, I added Ada Lovelace to the list.
: ;mikkalai 14 Nov 2003

If we are going to include language developers, then surely people like Conway (Algol 60), Niklaus Wirth (Pascal, Modula 2, Oberon, Euclid etc.), 
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (C, Unix), Bjarne Stroustrup (C++) Adele Goldmann (Smalltalk), Bertrand Meyer (Eiffel) should be included. There were some excellent people who worked on Algol and Algol 68 designs - the latter based on a 2 level grammar. Then of course there was work done on syntax directed analysis, and compiler-compiler systems.

----

Rather than Goldmann, Goldberg, will be probably better, and more precisely Alan Kay with his 2004 Turing Award has now 
a merited recognition.... See HP site and ACM.

Work on operating systems is a bit of a disaster, since we've now evolved to have the wretched Windows OS everywhere - it's good enough for its general purpose, but it is not good enough for real-time, or highly secure systems. There was a lot of work on these areas in the 1970s and 1980s, but most of it seems to have been  discarded. Even Unix was not necessarily an advance in all respects over Multics (Corbato) on which it was based.

What about databases? Ted Codd?

Communications - going over to hardware etc. - perhaps Larry Roberts.

From a theoretical POV, surely Church and Post should also feature alongside Alan Turing.

:There's a lot who could be added. I think the main article should limit itself to 20 or so that are most famous, then link to a [[List of computer scientists]] for the larger crowd of notables. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 13:17, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)

::If you want some candidates for your "20 most famous", you could try [[Turing Award]]. I added, at a minimum, stubs for all the winners.--[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 00:45, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)
::I agree with your comments, though the "list of computer scientists" should have a sentence or 2 about each, giving a clue about what each did.

* See my remark above about the Pioneering criteria for putting into the list. A person may earn Turnig Award for pushing to excellence of things already known, but this does not necessarily change the face of Computer Science. The Hall of Fame can be miles long. Why don't we split it into lobbies related to particular "subsciences", reserving the "master hall" to those who burrowed these lobbies?

I suggest a re-ordering of the "subfield" part, e.g. IMHO "lexical analysis" is not theoretical CS, but a subtopic of compiler construction. The difference between "applied CS" and "specific techniques" is not clear. Some parts in the "applied CS" section could be re-grouped to something like "application areas", e.g.:
Bioinformatics,
Computational Biology,
Computational Chemistry,
Computational Physics,
Media Informatics, ...

:These should be restricted to actual computer science topics, not just any scientific activity that happens to use computers. The ACM's CR category scheme would be a solid basis; it's complete and authoritative, although the category titles would have to be adapted to point to existing WP articles. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 21:42, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:I tried to base the re-ordering on the ACM classification, without deleting entries present (only exception: collision detection, which is referenced in computer graphics). There are still a lot of pointers to WP articles missing. I left the un-touched subtopics in lowercase to indicate this for the time being.

::Cool! Interestingly, the categories are broader than computer science proper, for instance software engineering is included even though the article itself explicitly excludes it.  Partly this is because the ACM's scope is all of [[computing]], not just the scientific stuff, and partly because there are CS articles that study topics connected to SE, so the category scheme needs to include. Will think about to prune or what. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 16:24, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Is there a voting mechanism for Wiki changes?

:No, there is no need for one.  We create articles which everyone can agree upon by using a technique that we call [[Wikipedia:NPOV|NPOV]].  It works in the majority of cases.  It only seems to fail when irrational people get involved and they probably wouldn't pay attention to a vote either.  Voting has only been used for choices which are a matter of taste such as which date format to use or which would be the best logo for Wikipedia. -- [[User:Derek Ross|Derek Ross]]

----

The list of topics (which is most of the article) seems to belong to a "list of computer science topics" page. Though of course, until there is more text (content) worth reading at the top, there is no reason to split the page.
Anyone interested in adding narrative text?

Also, the list of topics need not resemble the ACM list, which was made for the ACM. The ACM is interested in "computing" which includes all of CE, CS, SE, and IT. The Wikipedia list should meet the needs of Wikipedia. This page is about CS and the list should be tailored for CS. The Wikipedia pages on CE, SE, and IT can cover all non-CS content. (Just my opinion.)

-----

A lot of articles on computer-related topics have begun like this: "In computer science, ''xyz'' is a ...." In many of these cases, the term being defined is not a computer-science term. It's Unix jargon, or a programming or computer-security term. It is a common misapprehension that programmers, systems administrators, network engineers, and the like are "doing computer science" when they do their work -- and thus that their jargon is computer-science terminology. Computer science is an academic field, connected to mathematics, which does not have anything in particular to do with [[daemon]]s, [[computer virus]]es, [[Multi-core (computing)|core]], or other bits of computer ''technology''. I am going through the list of pages which link to [[computer science]] and altering these introductions. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 04:30, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Why do so many users use this as a test page? [[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 04:13, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)

----

Would it be more useful to order the pioneers chronologically, instead of alphabetically?  [[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 01:18, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)

* I'd say no. There should already be a timeline that should include these people if they were wanting to look for them chronologically. when listing important people the standard is usually alphabetically by last name.--[[User:Dhuss|Dhuss]] 15:58, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Computer science and commercial IT ==

I've only skimmed the surface on this topic, so point me in the right direction! Please!

It seems that there is little reference to business IT here, there's an exclusive concentration on science and theory. Elsewhere, under 'business' there's no separate referral to 'IT' or 'Data processing'. So the interdependence and development of these two areas seems to be missed, including development methodologies.

Also the important (for commerce) topic of 'legacy systems' needs to be addressed.

Which applies: 
a)I have missed obvious references, 
b) these topics are of no interest to Wiki, 
c) the topics are dealt with under other headings, 
d) the topics need to be addressed.

:IT is a different topic from CS.  You might put a section here about relationships to IT and link to [[Information technology|that article]] though. [[User:K.lee|k.lee]] 21:00, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:To expand: Not every topic that is studied, which has to do with computers, is part of ''computer science'' as it is usually defined. Computer science could as well have been called "computation science," since it has to do more with computations -- functions, algorithms, data structures, processes -- rather than with those tools that we call computers. Data-processing, in the sense of database theory, is rightly part of computer science; it may be sometimes unfairly marginalized because much of the research came out of industry rather than academia. IT management -- including "development methodologies" if by that you mean ideas such as "waterfall model" and "extreme programming" -- are outside of computer science. Likewise, the design of networking protocols can be within CS, but learning to configure a Cisco router is not. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 00:36, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)
::To pull back from my prior statement a bit, the extent to which software engineering, human-computer interaction, and other "soft" computing-related topics belong in CS proper is a contested subject.  The last couple of issues of the CACM have had a running debate on this between columnists and letter-writers.  (Not that the CACM is a great publication, these days, but nevertheless it's a magazine published by the premier CS professional organization.)  Most, if not all, computer science departments at least give ''some'' attention to software engineering subjects, including development methodologies.  The distinction isn't simple.  Nevertheless there are probably some subjects that don't really fall within CS.  These probably include information about particular vendors' software, or very "management-ish" information.  I agree that this is a fuzzy definition.  I wish I had a better one. [[User:K.lee|k.lee]]

== Church-Turing thesis ==

The informal description given of the Church-Turing thesis is not really right. The thesis doesn't imply that all known general computing machines are '''equivalent''' in what they can do, since there are certainly computing machines with '''less''' power than a Turing machine (like the PC on your desk for a start, since anything with finite memory is an FSA <grin>). That is, unless one refuses to admit anything less powerful than a Turing machine as a "general" computing machine - but then the statement becomes a tautology! However, I can't think of a good way of phrasing it accurately without getting more technical than is desirable here. Can anyone do so? [[User:Cambyses|Cambyses]] 21:51, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I don't think the informal statement can help but sound a little tautological, after it's a "thesis" not a "law". Another way to look at it is that it's stating a negative - there aren't several kinds of computation that are somehow of comparable power but completely different from each other. Fortunately we can rely on the link to the full article that goes into the details; this article is to explain computer science to the general public, not to specialists.

== Coding and Information Theory ==

Under '''Data and Information Systems''', ''Coding and Information Theory'':

Do you mean for ''Coding'' to point to a page on programming, or are you referring to ''Coding Theory'' here?

== Quantum computer outline ==

The following contribution by 129.215.45.2 was moved from the main article as it was out of step with the intro, which is mainly about the definition and origins of computer science as a field of study. --[[User:Zigger|Zigger]] 15:16, 31 May 2004 (UTC)
:Recent advance in the field of computer science have been attributed to a team of crack researchers at Edinburgh University. This team lead by Dr. David Bould has successfully managed to provide an outline for a quantum computer. This computer can calculate anything in polynomial time processing 2.4 million gigabits of data a second. This advance is sure to have a significant impact on computer science and the world in general.

== Prominent pioneers again ==

Note to all: I just came back from a standardization/removal/addition blitz. I agree with mikkalai: Iverson doesn't belong on the list. I am shocked that Church was not on the list. Church, who had been one of the founders of theoretical computer science, was not on the list of the legends of cs, but someone like Kahan was? Turing is most famous for his founding contributions to cs, specifically his TM (also not to mention cryptography), and not AI. Godel belongs in the list for beginning the essence of undecidability with his incompleteness theorem. Godel's work is so insanely intertwined with the development of complexity theory that to ignore him is to ignore the true geniuses in the field. I can't believe that people like Godel and Church, both of whom were true geniuses, were left off of a list filled with comparably dumb people. And Turing's work was left uncredited or credited for some work he didn't do. Sorry guys, but I'm so surprised that the list has been left this way. Furthermore, this list still lacks luminaries in the theory side. If you guys will let me, I will come up with more. This list is woefully short on so many levels. -[[User:DoesPHalt|DoesPHalt]] 08:51, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:(I took the liberty of moving the comment to bottom to start a new "thread", as per usual practice.) One of the things I don't like about the short list of people in this article is that it's difficult not be POV about it. So for instance people who specialize in theory of computation might think that it's ultra-critical to include Gödel, while a numerical analysis person will cast doubts on the judgment of anyone who doesn't think Wilkinson is as deserving. There are a handful that almost everybody can agree on, like Turing and Knuth, but beyond that it's that harder. For instance, I would say that Gödel is marginal because he was a mathematician, and although the theory laid groundwork for computing, there are a hundred other mathematicians whose work did likewise, and that doesn't make any of them a pioneer of computer science as it's understood today. The list does need to be short and selected, because we already have a long [[list of computer scientists]], don't need to be redundant with that one. There are 17 people in the CS article as I write; I suggest capping it at 15, which means dropping a couple (I risk wrath of the numericals by suggesting Cooley/Tukey). Cap means that if you want to add any others, somebody has to drop off; still risk of POV debates, but unlikely to be as contentious as the perennially-debated [[Western canon]]. :-) [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 17:36, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::I agree that there needs to be a number to prevent overflow. 15 sounds like a good number. Now, for cutting two off: i agree with you to remove the cooley/tukey bullet. Also, I suggest removing iverson. Back to Godel's achievemenents: there is no single mathematician who has affected cs more than he has. I understand that I am talking from a theory pov. The reason why he is so influential is that logic has the expressiveness to articulate problems. So, logic-related problems are found to be naturally complete for the classes that contain them. Godel broke classical logic, and complexity wouldn't be here in its modern form without Godel. His incompleteness result for first-order logic echoes everywhere in the complexity results. In fact he began the first questioning of computation in a complexity theory aspect: in a [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rudich/complexity/godelHTML/godel.htm letter] from Godel to von Neumann right before the latter genius died, Godel outlined the core foundations of complexity theory in about two pages (he said something to the effect of it would be so interesting and fun to classify problems by the resources necessary to solve it) and stated the P=NP? problem (saying that the role of the mathematician wouldn't exist if P=NP), although without all the language of classes and such. If complexity theory is important to cs (you can roughly say complexity is worth half of the theory aspect), godel belongs on the list. I'm probably enraging non-theory guys, but also Cantor should be on the list as well. Cantor's diagonalization argument is the only tool that we have (ok, i'm generalizing, but it's almost true) to do stuff in complexity. Actually, the reason P=NP? problem is so hard is because the diagonalization argument doesn't apply. I understand that mathematicians lay the groundwork for a lot of cs work (who would be here without the function concept or... abstract algebra or probability?), but Godel started something big in cs. I know, Cantor is a bit of a stretch. But, what I'm tring to say is that someone like lovelace has no right to be on that list if someone like Godel isn't. Tell me what  you think. -[[User:DoesPHalt|DoesPHalt]] 00:42, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

First, there is already a list of prominent pioneers in computer science: [[Turing Award]] winners.  There is therefore no need to have a list of prominent computer pioneers, ''except'' for those pioneers who predate the Turing Award (e.g., Turing).  I suggest that the section be rewritten to (1) briefly note the role of the Turing Award, (2) link to the Turing Award article (which includes a list of winners), and (3) list a few "pre-historic" computer scientists like Turing, Church, Babbage, Lovelace, etc.

Second, it seems to me that there is a subtle difference between a computer science pioneer, and a mathematician whose work ended up being especially important for computer science.  Godel is probably one of the latter (others might include Cantor, Kleene, Curry, etc.).  The most important such mathematicians should be listed in a separate subsection; the rest might merit a separate article [[List of mathematicians important to computer science]]. [[User:K.lee|k.lee]] 02:57, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Yeah, Gödel just doesn't do it for me as a pioneer of computer science. One way to quantify further might be to divvy up by specialties, say eight of them, languages, OS, theory, etc, then you get to pick the most significant from each specialty, plus there's some all-around people. Under that model, you get to pick one theory-related person - would you bump Church or Shannon to put in Gödel? Lovelace I think is bumpable - she is better characterized as a pioneer in [[computing]], not so much "computer science". Going by specialties, I see no AI people - McCarthy? - or database person. Turing Award idea is interesting, main downside is that the list is getting longish and in retrospect some have proven more significant than others. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 07:37, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Another thought: we don't '''have''' to have a list of pioneers - it probably dates from earliest WP, people throwing in whatever came to mind. One could instead have a short history of CS, "namedrop" the key early people within the narrative (Gödel would fit nicely in that way for instance), then link to Turing Award and complete lists. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 07:45, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

The possession of a Turing Award isn't a necessary or sufficient litmus test for qualifying the holder to be a pioneer in computer science. That is, it isn't the case that A revolutionized cs if and only if A got a Turing Award. But, except for a few people, the iff does hold usually. I think a combination of both ideas will fit nicely: we could create a very short history to cover the roots of its varied disciplines mentioning its founders and then mention the value of a Turing Award (the equivalent of a Nobel Prize for cs) and link the reader to the ACM Turing Award list. I'm not qualified enough to write this: I don't know enough about all the fields. If someone with info and qualifications could do it, it would be awesome. O yes... just as a side metion: it seems Curry didn't do what we all know him for- curried functions. Apparently, the work is credited to Schonfinkel.

::I think this discussion is getting interesting, and is probably much more interesting than any give list of 15 people. I added the original "pioneers" list to this page because I wanted to humanize the topic, by citing specific people and saying what they did.

::I did not intend to make it the "best 15 people", but only 15 interesting people. The "best 15 people" is very complex and has problems with POV as stated above. Naming 15 important and interesting people would give a student reading the page somewhere to go. For example, the original list had Larry Wos for resolution throerm proving. Wos is a fascinating guy, blind, worked his way through college playing poker, etc. I believe that the list does not matter too much.

::The reason to keep a short list of poineers on the page, is because pages should be somewhat self-contained. There are hundreds of links on the CS page. Casual readers are much more likely to scan the text on the same page than to click to the "Turing Award" page to find out that there were some important people. Casual readers do not know which links to follow, and cannot be expected to stumble over the ones they need. Each page should introduce all relevant material without links. This is perhaps my biggest pet peeve about Wikipedia. -- The Phantom Avenger

:::One of the things to think about when adding material is whether later editors will understand why it's there. I had no idea there was ever a goal of listing "interesting" people irrespective of importance, so of course I put my own interpretation on it. Given that "interestingness" is so subjective, I think it would be hard to stabilize - unusual college employment is interesting to one person, uninteresting to another; it will tend to drift towards something more objectively measurable, such as general significance, Turing award, etc. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 05:26, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::Web pages must evolve natually. Long ago, I stopped worrying about who was on the list. I simply stated my original intent as a point of histoical interest. I am sure that you all will figure out a useful list. I think the discussion of whether it should be "non-turing award winners" or "pre-historical (before 1960) people" or "most famous" to be interesting. All these criteria have merit.

::::In general, plain lists are very boring. But a list with a set of reasons is much more interesting. The "Major fields of importance for computer science" section is very boring. The "Prominent pioneers in computer science" and "Related fields" sections are much more interesting. The prose in the introduction is the most interesting part of this page. If you want to do something to improve the page, move the lists in the "major fields" section to another page.

== "Debate over name" incoherent para ==

I replaced this paragraph from the section entitled "Debate over name", and renamed that section. It is not clear from the (uncited) paragraph what this "debate" is, who debates it, or its importance. Surely if this is a real "debate" then there would be some papers or letters or something in which practitioners take sides:

:''There is some debate over whether the name of the field should be ''computer science'', ''computational engineering'', or ''software engineering''. The first name is the original, traditional name, however it implies that CS studies computers. The second name is more recent, and it implies that CS studies what we do with computers. The third name recognizes that mostly the field studies software.''

What's more, this para treats "software engineering" as an alternate name for computer science. This is not a usage I'm familiar with. As described in the [[software engineering]] article, software engineering is an attempt to apply engineering methodology to software ''production'' -- the managing and work of programming. It is not the same as computer science.

I've replaced this para with one that does not pretend to describe a "debate" but rather simply the perceived inaccuracy of the name "computer science". If anyone has any ''sources'' for particular positions people have taken on names for the discipline, feel free to reintroduce the "debate" meme. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 05:15, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== What's really a "computer scientist", strictly speaking? ==

I want to raise this question in the context of WKP categories such as [[:Category:German computer scientists]]. Someone just added [[Konrad Zuse]] to that category. However, Zuse was educated as a [[civil engineering|civil engineer]], but later went on to construct several pioneering electro-mechanical computers, of which his [[Z3]] is arguably the first actual computer in the modern sense (no holy wars, please---this is a controversial subject, to say the least...).

In light of the above, my question is this: should categories of computer ''scientists'' also include self-taught pioneers like Zuse and others of his generation, or should we include only people educated as computer scientists as such? I acknowledge, of course, the groundbreaking efforts many of those engineers and scientists did for computer science and, perhaps even more to the point, c. ''engineering''. --[[User:Wernher|Wernher]] 19:43, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

: A scientist is simply someone how uses the scientific method to invent new theories. This means that most people educated as computer scientists, are not, because they usually work as (software) engineers. [In contrast someone without any formal education, can be a computer scientist. For example one of the full professors in computer science at Utrecht University was educated as a physicist.] About Konrad Zuse... he shows many parallels with Alan Turing, in my opinion the greatest computer scientist that has walked this earth. But as far as I know, and I must admit that I don't know much more about Zuse that he invented the first computer and programming language, he worked more as an engineer than as a scientist. However, not having him under [[:Category:German computer scientists]], would be further from the truth than having him in here. --[[User:R.Koot|R.Koot]] 20:04, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:Self-taught or even amateur scientists in an area should always be able to qualify if they did something significant. In addition to building machines, Zuse thought about how to program them, which is where his CS credentials come from. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 20:21, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Like all fields it's not the schooling but the knowledge. I agree with Stan that having a Degree in CS doesn't make you a Computer Scientist any more than a degree in spoken Italian makes me a Italian speaker(I doubt you can get a degree in just Italian, but understand the point behind it). Formal education should just be taken as a guideline. Every great person in a field was self-educated to some extent, or else they would just be repeating predefined facts and formulas, and thats what people at McDonalds, not great minds, do. At least that is my definition, the ability to manipulate the knowledge to bring better clarity or perfection to ideas. According to that it doesn't matter where the information came from, but how it is used. 2cents.--[[User:Capi crimm|Capi crimm]] 06:17, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

A computer scientist is a scientist that computes. Okay, that is blunt. However, I've seen two realms of computer scientists, and that is the academic follower and those that make computer science a religion (to say the extreme). Those that follow academia are just after the degree and only just study the field to achieve such degree. Those that go beyond study alone apply and live by the bounds of computer science. Anotherwords, evolution and creationism have been analogous to opposite forces of science and religion, but computer science can work with either if it logically computes. My opinion is the with the recent growth of intelligent design and the hype that there is nothing that competes is wrong hype -- as there is computer science. Computer scientist would claim God is a hacker and the human body is a machine, while intelligent design would claim that somebody intelligent like God must have designed the human body. Anyways, those are just some poinst of extreme to compare (or compute) the differences. --- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 18:14, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

== Computing as a Discipline????? ==

This paragraph defines "computing" rather than "computer science". Unless there is a really good reason, this definition should be moved to the [[computing]] page.

== Pioneers ==

I think that N. Chomsky should also be included in the list of pioneers in Computer Science. Almost in every introduction book to CS theory, you can see his "Chomsky Hierarchy"...

:I agree. My second class of Discrete structures focused solely on the Chomsky Hierarchy and the related models of computation for each level of the hierarchy. Fascinating stuff btw, Chomsky is an Einstein of our generation.  -WilyCoder

::Dr. Chomsky's Hierarchy describes a formal way for describing any complete grammar. Since computer languages tend to be complete grammars, they most certainly take from the Chomsky Hierarchy. In fact, Dr. Knuth once suggested in an [[ACM]] conference that there should be a C somewhere in the [[BNF]] acronym, in honor of Dr. Chomsky.
:: But, CS is a multi-disciple science and in this case it takes loan from linguistics, which is the area Dr. Chomsky applied his theory in, to assist humans to communicate with computers. I don't think that Dr. Chomsky has done any work with or on computer science, and that is why I don't think we should mention him as one of the pioneers of CS. what we CAN describe him as is a pioneer in the area of context-free grammars, which compiler theory could not do without.

::If i had to give out a metaphore, i'd say it's like saying that Kurt Gödel should be mentioned as a pioneer of the field because [[Automata theory]] comes out his work on logic and set theory. [[User:Project2501a|Project2501a]] 19:52, 12 October 2005 (UTC)



== Proposition to improve the "field of computer science" section ==

The page [[list of academic disciplines]] has a nice list, which is the following:

Computer science

    * Algorithms
    * Artificial intelligence
    * Computer security
    * Computing
    * Complexity theory
    * Cryptography
    * Distributed systems
    * Hardware
    * Programming (see List of programming languages)
    * Formal methods
    * Information systems
    * Robotics
    * Software engineering

See also: [[ACM]] Computing Classification System

I think we could build upon this list to improve the "field of computer science", adding (many) details.
IMHO, the current list is scruffy, mixing High-level fields with minor fields, without any hierarchy...
--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 20:57, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:I agree 100%. The section should I think be converted to prose form (paragraphs), and it would be better to use categories to form the lists. The section should be a discussion of the fields in a more encyclopedic format (explaining them and how they interrelate). Also, I assume each of these have their own articles, so we don't necessarily need to cover them in much detail here - just in what way they relate to computer science as a discipline and to each other.

=== Scientific use of computers ===

A posteriori, it seems to me that a central point of the discussion herunder is to question if a scientific use of a computer is to be considered as part of CS. C.f. hereunder for details. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 22:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

==== Scientific use of computers is not computer science ====

Dear all,

in the first paragraph, the following sentence can be found:

"By definition, computer science is the accumulated knowledge through scientific methodology by computation or by the use of the computer."

I strongly disagree with this sentence, so I removed it but it was reintroduced later by another user.
I will remove it once more, but this time please let me explain why I disagree.

"accumulated knowledge through scientific methodology by computation" is not sufficient for being computer science.
Accumulated knowledge through scientific computation is an empirical approach amongst others.
There are basically three ways of doing such accumulation of knowledge:

- Experiment "in vivo",
- Experiment "in vitro", and a (new) type of experiments
- Experiment "in computers" (simulations), or "in silicone" as I have heard it named...

Therefore if accumulated "knowledge through scientific methodology by computation" is obtained on say:
some physical phenomenon, biological phenomenon, chemical phenomenon, etc..., 
Then this is physics, biology, or chemistry respectively, but NOT computer science.

Please remember the citing of Dijkstra:
Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.


To illustrate what I mean, and poorly copying Dijkstra, I would say:
Computer science is no more about "Accumulated knowledge through scientific computation"
than biology is about test tubes...

The use of a computer to gather scientific results those not mean you are doing computer science!!!
If you "accumulate knowledge through scientific computation" AND if this knowledge is related to computer
science (e.g. experimentally testing the complexity of an algorithm), then THIS is computer science. 
Note that computer science doese not necessarily imply the use of a computer (e.g. theoretical computer science usually favors a mathematico-deductive approach to an "in silicone" empirical approach to computer science).

: I agree entirely and I think most people will. [[User:Wlievens|Wouter Lievens]] 08:16, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

::I disagree. Very simply, the verbial form of "to accumlate" is confused with its adjective form by the above argument. That is obvious by how the argument focuses on the scientific accumlation in point (if "related to computer science"), rather than the focus on "to compute" and the knowledge related to that computation. Also, a computer is not limited to a siliconic existance.

:: "''The use of a computer to gather scientific results those not mean you are doing computer science!!!''" Right. It means you did regular science through computer science.

:: "''If you "accumulate knowledge through scientific computation" AND if this knowledge is related to computer science (e.g. experimentally testing the complexity of an algorithm), then THIS is computer science.''" --- Such statement here is recursive and thus lacks any definition. It doesn't improve the definition on the page.

::: Oh well, if you dont understand this sentence, you did not understand me at all. Is it better like that?

:::If you "accumulate knowledge through computation" AND if this knowledge is related to procedural epistemology (e.g. experimentally testing the complexity of an algorithm), then THIS is computer science.

:::If you "accumulate knowledge through computation" AND if this knowledge is  NOT related to procedural epistemology (e.g. numerically solving differential equations), then THIS is NOT computer science.

:: "''Note that computer science doese not necessarily imply the use of a computer (e.g. theoretical computer science usually favors a mathmatico-deductive approach to an "in silicone" empirical approach to computer science).''" --- A computer is not limited to a siliconic existance. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 14:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)


::: I found this definition for computer science on the web:

::: "...The systematic study of computing systems and computation. The body of knowledge resulting from this discipline contains theories for understanding computing systems and methods; design methodology, algorithms, and tools; methods for the testing of concepts; methods of analysis and verification; and knowledge representation and implementation...." (http://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/bluebooks/1995/section.5.html)

::: There is a discussion on the article page of wether the *name* "Computer Science" is a good name to describe what the science called "computer science" is. Most computer scientists agree the name is bad, so in perticular the etymology of "computer science" reflects badly what computer science is, so I really wish the sentence "by definition, computer science is..." would be removed (but I will let somebody else do it this time...). What do you think of the above definition I found on the web?

:::: To answer both... There seems to be a veil about what computer science is for some. Inside the veil there is the hardware, the software, and the math that all exists because of the computers and computation. Outside the veil one sees that the computer science is more of that. If there is a way to simply explain it, we could say it is the realm of science that computes, as not everything in science computes. With the definition above, it states "theories for understanding," but that would be theoritical computer science and not based on any factual foundation. Computer science is what computes and that means the use of facts to compare facts and get a result, and that result becomes accumlated knowledge. I also consider that definition found on the web as poorly written English, so I wouldn't trust it to be from computer scientist. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 23:13, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

::::: OK! I think we are close to agree on what we disagree! For me, computer science is not at all the realm of science that computes, since many scientists (perhaps one day every scientist) use computations/simulations (I have friends which are biologist, physicians (and to a lesser extend mathematicians) and who spent there whole time doing computer simulations, but I dont consider themcomputer scientists, and I dont think they do either)... On the other hand, it seems (do I get you right) that you consider theoretical computer science not to be part of computer science (or even not science at all??? (I suppose certain science philosophers, e.g [[Karl Popper]] would probably agree, but most computer scientists would not)), whereas from my points of view, theoretical computer science is part of computer science.

:::::: So.. We agree that people who just use a computer are not computer scientists. The knowledge that is gained by compters is part of computer science. If you can run a simulation of a what heat does to a sample cellular lifeform, the simulation is done through computer science. 
::::::: You say: ''The knowledge gained is part of computer science''. I strongly disagree on that: '''The knowledge gained is clearly part of biology'''. This seems very obvious to me, and this is precisely why I want to remove the sentence! Doese anybody else disagree on that??? The simulation is indeed done through the use of a computer, (and probably but not surely computer science will be an important tool, posibly amongst other tools, like mathematics...).
:::::::: Whoa! You didn't include a logic phrase that I typed: by computers. I questioned if it was intentional or a misperception, yet you further agrued with your ideas that it "is clearly part of biology," and more so below. Either way, you pointed out it is obvious, and that doesn't seem so obvious. If we use a bit from biotechnology, we find cellular forms that perform based on its DNA/RNA. I, thus, have argued in this life that such cellular-based body has similar actions like a computer such that it follows instructions (DNA) like a program to perform a variety of tasks, like move a finger or grow muscle to move that finger. I further have argued that such cellular body is programmed to listen to a life, like you within your body. Computer science has the knowledge of how the cellular body works as a machine, and the field of biology looks at the expressions of the cellular-body to study the lifeform the life renders with such body. Anotherwords, somehow you have written words here to express yourself and your arguement about what is computer science, and that is your life that has manipulated your body to further write across the Internet where others can preceive such communication. Given that biotechnology is real, it unintentionally defines a line between your life and your body that is not your life but just Earth. Given that Earth is a resource to make a PC as well as your body, they have much in common. With such commonality between the elements of a PC and body, it is just not so, as you said, "clear" and "obvious" that your body is really more defined by biology or by computer science. Unfortunately, whatever "life" is made of, it is not obvious enough to become a fact of science. Because of that fact of life, I have argued that everything about you except your life is a part of computer science, and wonder what silly hacker reprogrammed your body to argue that you are something more than a biologic robot. Seriously, by what means would you prove it that your really alive? Show me your proof. Some say discrete math is for massochists. I say "good luck" on your Turing test. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 18:19, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

::::::In a weird way, twist it and warp it until you see computer science as the looking glass. 
::::::: I like this Mr. Ballard! Thats exactly what I meant by comparing computers to test tubes (experiments in vitro), and I proposed to call this experiments "in computers", although some call it experiments "in silicone" (although I am plainly aware all computing devices do not contain silicon, and maybe one day no computing device will contain silicon...)
::::::Those that can manipulate the glass are computer scientists -- just like optometrists. You don't, consequently, become an optometrist when you wear glasses.
::::::: Telescopes, testubes, computers, can all be seen as as way of "looking at" (like glass in your example). The main question is not who knows how to manipulate the tool, but the question is what do you look at using the tool! Let me play the following game.
::::::: * Lets define ''micro-scopes'' and ''tele-scopes'' as being simply ''scopes''.
::::::: * Lets add to the class ''scopes'' computers (Dijskra's citing allows me to do this with no too much arguing), and I call them computer-scopes.
::::::: Now tele-scopes are mainly used in astronomy (am I right?), but surely, micro-scopes are used in many sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, etc..). Computer-scopes, like micro-scopes are used in many sciences: computer science, biology (you gave an example), physics (I gave one), mathematics, social sciences, etc...
::::::: I propose you try to see computer scientists not as people who have the knowledge of manipulating a computer-scope, just like atrophysicists are not people who know how to manipulate or build a tele-scope.
:::::: *** About theoretical computer science, this is where alot of discrete math is used to predict what can compute or what there will be to compute. To me, theoretical computer science is a part of discrete math as theoretical computation. It must depend on one's perspective -- from a strong math background or from a strong computer science background. 
::::::: Ok, lets not argue about this too (because yes, I disagree!). It is perfectly ok that you have your own opininion about this, and I suppose that you could find good arguments to defend your point of view, but please be aware the the community of theoretical computer scientists, from what I know of, consider themselves to be computer scientists before being mathematicians (a discussion abit like this not so long ago on Lance Fortnow's (a top theoretical computer scientist) weblog: http://weblog.fortnow.com/2005/09/cocktail-conversations.html), also official ACM classification includes theoretical computer science (TCS) as part of computer science, etc... So if your definition of computer science excludes TCS, although it may be interesting, it is a marginal definition.
:::::: *** Do realize that there is a big difference between computer scientist and software engineers. I've seen many times that software engineers think they are computer scientist because they know how to program or build logic devices. In reality, the computer scientist build the tools, objects, and knowledge that the software engineer uses to perform. The computer scientist is at a much lower level than a software engineer, and that is the point I see missed many times. At one time, the computer was a name for a person. Personal Computer must have had some kind of pun intended. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 21:30, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

Also consider that the answer to the Turing test is simple when you realize that you can't proove the existence of life without computers. The answer falls in an area that isn't science, but it is computer science. It isn't science because by scientific principles one cannot demonstrate any proof of life's constitution. We can, however, use a scientific methodology to form a logic difference. That difference, whatever it is really, is only found when we program a computer that has no life to attempt to act like it did have life and pass the Turing test. Without computers, like similar to how you left it out of the quote, you would not realize that the one who took the test is a computer or of real life. Without computers, we don't have computer science. Have you studied what the Turing test is all about? ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 18:19, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

I lost track of all the handwaving here, but suffice it to say that the "by definition" definition is totally bogus. The etymology is irrelevant to current meaning (as are most etymologies), and a formal definition more elaborate than "scientific study of computation" is almost certainly going to run afoul of real-life exceptions. If anyone just can't stand not having more detail than the simple phrase, then add some quotes from famous introductory CS textbooks. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 03:11, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
 
: Maybe this is sufficient indeed! Also, this discussion in itself shows that defining computer science, a young science, is not trivial. So the "by definition..." is indeed to easy...

:: I've seen many attempts that have used a recursive defintion or a "study of" type definition that really doesn't define computer science at all. This might not say much, but computer science is knowledge. More specifically, computer science is a fraction of total knowledge. We still can't identify what patrs of knowledge is computer science and what parts is not, unless we show what is accumulated knowledge through scientifc methodology by computation or by the use of the computer, or at least for what one can compute themselves. In figure of speech, we can say the computer science puts a nail in science. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 21:30, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Below are the roots of the words as found in major dictionaries. Most definitions of "computer science" I found are more of a definition for "computing" or limited to an academic field rather than one that defines "computer science" down to earth. Most state that they involve computers in the study, but they still really don't define it. Some use the define it as part of a engineering science with study into its theory, systems, tools, etc, but that is only the engineering part of it. Limited by exclusion of original research, I used a consensus of what computer science is from major dictionaries and encyclopedias. From what you want to do is add the aspects of what computer science engineers do into the definition. I don't say that your wrong, Powo. The version you want is a much higher level definition and is limited as such. The version below is much lower level and includes your version. What I suggest you do is to include your version as another paragraph or somehow combine the entire paragraph together without deletion of the lower level definition. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 15:14, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

::::I throw in my two cents.  Computer Science is the study of computation.  Simple as that.  All the other noise -- software engineering, computer engineering, discrete mathematics, etc. are related but separate fields.  I think Dijskra said it best: "Computer Science is as much the study of computers as astronomy is the study of telescopes."  The point is that the computers facilitate investigations into computability.  I would also point out the the concepts of algorithms date to the first millennium.--[[User:Mpeisenbr|Mpeisenbr]] 18:05, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
 
::::: I agree with this definition, although it doese not say much more than 'computer science' is really 'computation science'. Even though not very informative, this definition has the advantage of being accurate, in contradiction to the current definition: '"By definition, computer science is the accumulated knowledge through scientific methodology by computation or by the use of the computer"' which is twice erroneous since:
:::::* It implicitely means that this is the etymologycal definition of computer science (i.e. the science that studies computers)
:::::* It implicitely implies that it is the defintion as it is widely accepted (i.e. the science that studies computation, as you have said).
::::: We should: (a) remove the erroneous definition (b) put "your" definition instead (c) apply the plan proposed by stan hereabove.
::::: Timewise, a can be done before b which can be done before c. I will try to contribute to point c shortly, and I'll apply b and c right now...

:::::: Dijskra has a good point. On his point, there is much knowledge that can be gained when one uses a telescope. You don't have to have a telescope to have the same knowledge. Those with a spaceship could fly to the moon and learn the same thing as one who uses to a telescope to look at the same crater. Both methods are still fall into astronomy since from the perspective of here on earth it is astronomical. Computer Science doesn't only mean the study of computation but the science involves much more than computation. Like the telescope is the tool, computation and computers are the tools. Academically, it could be said it is the study of the body of knowledge justified by computation, but computer science is more than just an academic field. The definition that includes the scientific methodology is the one about its practical everyday use. One doesn't have to study computers or computation to work in computer science. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 00:16, 7 November 2005 (UTC)


::::::: It is true that there is merely two uses of the words 'computer science'.
::::::: * Computer science as a scientific discipline
::::::: * Computer science used in everyday language, which just roughly means "anything related to computers"
::::::: The question is, (a) what is this page trying to define (b) do you have any reference to this definition or some similar definition?
::::::: The thing is "your" definition seems to define what computer ''science'' is, but I dont think computer scientists agree with it.

::::::: I do think one needs to study computations to be a computer scientist. Many people who work in the comnputer related area are more computer engineers, a sister discipline. Actually the union of them two is called the 'disipline of [[computing]]' by the ACM task force who was asked to think about that. Dear sir, I realy think you should agree your definition to be removed, unless you can give evidence that there is some more widely recognition of your point of view. If this were so, it would be interesting and we could include it in the "plan of stan" we where talking about.--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 07:39, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

==== Earlier revision of definition ====

Here is the text cut from an earlier revision. It helps explain the roots of the definition. The sentence below as it existed in the article was split appart in attempt to put the details further in the article. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 14:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

:A computer is one that computes, where com- (with, together) joins putare (Latin root, to reckon, to think, or section as in to compare pieces), so by definition, computer science (Latin: scientia, knowledge) is the accumulated knowledge through scientific methodology by computation or by the use of the computer.

==== The Study of Computation, alone, does not define Computer Science ====

This is where we are at: Powo and Mpeisenbr state Computer Science is defined as "the study of computation." I provided sources, and I even further provided root terminology of the words. I haven't seen any source that defines computer science as such. I google'd it and actually the closest I've seen is a included study of the limits of computation, but not that alone. Lets put this another way, if one studies computation, one actually studies a process where input on a set of instructions produce an output, or at least that is one way to describe a way to study computation among many. That just kind-of included everything and nothing is particular. With that "study of computation," the argument emphasizes on what constitutes the instructor. The question arises of what kind of instructions are given and in what form are they. Further questions arise if the instructions where heuristic, genetic, algorithmic, natural, or phenomenal. Even if the input is known and well understood, the question arises of what is to be done with the output. If one studies computation just to see if a given input produces an output, that doesn't define computer science especially when all these other questions arise. A computer scientist does study the limits of computation. Anotherwords, a computer scientist wants to produce a well-formed computation. Yes, one must study computations in order to "compute" computations. Usually, an algorithm is written to express the computation. That would mean a computer scientist must also learn how to produce algorithms and not just study them. The means to produce such algorithms involves a practice. That practice goes well beyond experimentation and study. When one plays a musical instrument at a live concert, they aren't only there to just study musical talent, as they got to perform.

Powo, that kind of performance issue is what lacks in your points, or you haven't acknowledged it or even experienced it. I'm surprised you listed one reference above with a citation from the web about computer science, and you want to also agree to an incongruent definition like "the study of computation."

When you emphasized computer ''science'' with the focus on science, that is were I finally saw you take a step in the right direction about what computer science is about. Computer science is knowledge, yet what constitutes that knowledge can be governed by a computation. This computation simply tells us if the knowledge is in the realm of "computer science" or not. This computation is a proposition. If we say the proposition is "the study of computation," then what knowledge would hold true under that is was by a study of computation. Does that computation include any system of facts or does it base its output on theories? If the computation is based only on facts we could justify it as a pure solid science. If the computation includes any theory, it wouldn't be pure and be just a study of theory. There is nothing to the phrase "the study of computation" that justifies what makes the computation and thus what would be computer science. Do you follow this kind of propositional process? Anotherwords, does the involvement of a genetic instruction concern the computer scientists? Does the involvement of heuristic instructions concern the computer scientists? Does the involvement of phenomenal instructions concern the computer scientists? Actually, that last one would probably concern more than just the computer scientists! The computer scientists doesn't live by algorithmic instruction sets alone. To get back to a the knowledge governed by a computation, we could express such an algorithmic instruction in english. We want to define computer science, right? That definition of computer science qualifies as an algorithm. What set of instructions do you propose would define computer science, Powo? ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 18:44, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

: I am not sure I can follow you, and I have no answer to give to the question you address to me, which I do not understand. Sorry about that (maybe you can re-explain it, sorry if I am slow...). It seems to me you are trying to define something (which you call computer science, but I would not call it like that). From what I see, this ''something'' you are trying to define is more like some kind of a ''metaphysical'' theory (in the philosophical sense, not the pejorative sense) which has computer science as some kind of a foundational argument or corner stone. 
: However, and as you aknowledge hereabove, you could not find any reference to such a metaphysical definition of computer science. The reason, in my opinion, is that this is absolutely not what computer science is usually denominating: a scientific discipline, different yet similar to mathematics, physics, biology, etc... (Lets not argue wether computer science is a science or not, this depends on the definition of science...)
: What has possibly led you to choose the denomination ''computer science'' to denominate your philosophical point of view, is that computer science is also used (sadly fom my point of view) in common language to refer to any discipline (or technology, or whatsoever...) related somehow to computers.
: IMHO, you should find another group of words to define your point of view on what ''you'' call computer science.
: Of course, you could argue that I could do the same... But then, may I ask: what is the denomination you suggest for the scientific discipline which is done in academic circles and which I (as well as researchers from these "academic circles") call computer science?
: You have argued that defining computer science as the science that studies computations is restricted to the academic aspects of computer science. You are correct: computer science is an academic discipline, and what falls outside (the part you claim "my" definition forgets), is simply not computer science from my point of view. (Dont get me wrong: I put ABSOLUTELY no judgement of values in this last statement: what I call "not computer science" is just as good, as important, as intersting (at leats in some cases) as computer science!).
: --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 15:02, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

::Metaphysical? Where did you get that? I used the words from the dictionaries that tried to explain computer science, and I didn't just make them up.
::Oddly, you seem to have rested that computer science is only an academic discipline. That would mean those that are in a computer science job aren't really in computer science, by your theory, because they aren't in academia.
::: I think a computer scientist is a ''scientist'', a researcher, and therefore by definition he works in [[academia]]. At least under the definition of academia I was thinking about. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 23:50, 9 November 2005 (UTC)
:: Perhaps, you have wanted to use the scientific approach that academia uses to further computer science. That is valid, but realize not only academia does such.
::Above, of what you didn't follow, was a question to write a program to define computer science. It appears you are more mathematically biased than otherwise. Computer science is a body of knowledge. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 05:48, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

::: I am surprise you can contest you have metaphysical views and ask me at the same time what set of instructions defines computer science! Of course, I have no clue what set of instructions defines computer science. Also, I am not sure there is any meaning to this question, outside of some metaphysical ontology that the "world" runs on a computer, or something like that, which you have expressed earlier. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 23:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

Computer science, as the term is used in English, is the study of computation and the surrounding subjects -- things like data organization and retrieval; algorithms; programming language and operating system design; and so forth. But the term usually ''isn't'' used to include (say) electronic engineering, or computer applications training (how to use Word), or how to manage programmers.

Computer science includes work done in both academia and industry. Academic CS would imperil itself if it ignored the work of industrial researchers -- like IBM's Ted Codd, who invented [[relational database]] theory. Luckily, academics ''don't'' neglect industry, and today many of the problems worked on in academia and industry are very similar: such as large parallel systems (clusters; grids; whatever you like to call them).

: (I agree with what you mean, but on I dont think [[academia]] restricts to universities. At least I was thinking of the acception of the word which includes researchers working at universities AND similar institutions, e.g. the famous IBM research labs!!! --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 23:38, 9 November 2005 (UTC))

Nonetheless, it is an error to say or to imply that any "body of knowledge" having to do with computers is thereby ''computer science''. The field has its limits. I for one would place modern HCI outside of computer science -- industrial HCI these days is no longer limited by the computer side of the equation, but rather by the human side -- that is, by programmers' and engineers' (lack of) knowledge of human factors. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 06:58, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

I do not disagree that the study of computation is excluded. The study of computation, however, exists as a higher-level area within computer science. The study of computation doesn't define computer science, alone.

I've noticed you stated, "limited by the computer side of the equation, but rather by the human side." Does this mean you believe computers and humans are different like a thing and a person? Do realize that "computer" was the formal name given to a person that computed as a job, as a computer is simply "one that computes." It wasn't even a thing until more recent era. In this high-tech era, a computer more is more found as an electronic device in common sense. Consider these facts, and you'll notice that "computer science" changed by high-tech influences, but that doesn't mean its knowledge has to exclude the everything at the time it was founded before high-tech electronic devices were involved. Is it a science, yes. In fact, some colleges and universities have computer science under the department of Science (or "Letters & Science"). Others have it under Mathematics, Information Technology, or Engineering. Some have it under two or more. It is a science made by a computer. I'm sure we don't want to be consider a machine, so the difference between computers and humans is stronger today. If you look at the expression "computer science" and think of that computer as a person instead of a machine, it'll help understand the roots of the "body of knowledge." Today's computer scientists luckily do not have to tediously act like a computer as those did in the past. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 15:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

:Ah, now you're making a ''historical'' claim, and that's one for which we can ask for evidence. Can you give any evidence that the term "computer science" was ''ever'' used with the archaic sense of "computer" you describe? I disbelieve this claim; please prove it. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]]

===== Sources =====
Here are a few as requested. - Mr. B

* [[computer]] - "Originally, a "computer" (sometimes spelled "computor") was a person who performed numerical calculations under the direction of a mathematician"
* [[history of computing]] - "People were computers, as a job title, and used calculators to evaluate expressions."
* [http://www.computersciencelab.com/ComputerHistory/History.htm Computer History] - "The first computers were people!"; "Computer was originally a job title"

Do you need more?

I've noticed a lot of sources use a timeline of computing of late BC. Those timelines generally follow those that used numerical methods. It is of interest to me why those timelines don't show other non-numerical devices, like the great pyramids which had devices to compare (compute) locations of stars and planets. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 23:54, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

:Oh, I fully agree that the term "computer" archaically referred to people whose job was arithmetic. But that isn't what I asked you for sources on. I asked you for sources on your claim that the expression "computer science" was ever used to refer to what human computers did. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 17:12, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

::Good question. You don't point out exactly in what terms the referenence is used (of what you request), but I assume you don't mean you want something that specifically states "Mr. Blah did computer science in 1910 by hand." It won't be that easy to find. Oh, I can cite sources if needed, and I'll only give a summary for now.
* Only after 1940s what used to be "computing machines" before became to be known as "computers." 
* The suffix "er" describes a person, like "teach" and "-er." (Well, it used to until machines.)
* Physicist was the preferred titled until the scientific calculations were performed by computers.
* In the transition where computing machines became the computers, physicists became computer scientists, and what were human computers were replaced by artificial intelligence (which became a big part of computer science besides computation).
* With deduction applied to your question for sources on did human computers do "computer science," it is a tricky question since humans aren't considered artificially intelligent.
* However, the word "finger" is more of a modern invention then "digit."  Next time you try to pass a tricky question on me, I'll remind you to be sure to count your "dig it"s when you run out of toilet paper. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 00:22, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:OK, I see you don't actually have any sources for the idea that the term "computer science" was ever used with reference to human "computers". So I'll disregard that claim until you do, and will consider any further attempt to insert it into the article to be unacceptable. Thanks for your clarification. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 03:15, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::OK, I see you like to jump to conclusions quickly without any serious debate. I stated I do have sources, but why didn't you even acknowledge what I gave so far. I could tell by your tricky question that you wanted to jump to conclusions, and knew I better state a summary (even the humorous part). I haven't seen you try to give any sources in contrast. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 14:00, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

==== Why non-standard definition does not not belong in Wikipedia ==== 

'''A posteriori remark:''' The term "non-standard" definition hereabove refers to the following definition:
''The accumulated knowledge through scientific methodology by computation or by the use of the computer''

Dear Mr. Ballard, Your definition is a minority definition (yours only, since you still have no reference of anybody using ''computer science'' with your meaning), I think you agree with that. Summarizing your point of view, you say computer science is ''science done through the use of a computer'', where a computer has to be understood in its archaic sense, and that it is a very old science (archaic computers existed long before electronics). In this sense, your definition of computer science is an etymological definition. (Although the standard etymological definition is the science of computers). I understand your definition. However, I think your definition does not belong in Wikipedia, let me tell you why:

* Your point of view is innovative and unrecognised as legitimate in the community. Therefore, it has no place in an encyclopedia before it gains its legitimacy, e.g. by defending your point of view through publication in appropriate journals or conference proceedings.
::I didn't invent it. I just compiled it from sources. - Mr. B
* Those who have expressed themselves here have all said they disagree with you.
::This is anot true. Only you, powo, have made such alienated claim. - Mr. B
* Your definition is in contradiction with claims of world famous scientists like [[Dijkstra]] (Turing award) and [[Feynman]] (Nobel price). Let me remind you that Dijskra says that computer science is not (much) related to computers, whereas your definition puts computers as a central element. Feynman says that computer science is a YOUNG science, whereas you understand computer science as the body of knowledge accumulated over hundreds of years through the use of (archaic) computers. (Full citations of Dijskra and Feynman from which I deduce these two facts are on the main article page).
::You have stated that definition is a contradiction. I have found otherwise. - Mr. B

Because of what I have just said, your definition doese not belong (yet) to an Encyclopedia. From what I understand of Wikipedia, my previous statement implies your definition does not belong (yet) in Wikipedia. Btw, gentlemen, let's stay cool about all this: no toilet paper, fingers and black holes ;)
--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 09:13, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:I understand you want some solid background on it before you accept it. That is fine. Given the nature of computer science, I don't think you'll find exactly what you want. As many have claimed it to be a young science, there is no doubt much yet to concur.
:Do try to find other sources to make claim to what computer science is and how it became a fully recognized standard. This is one area that I believe when the consensus on wikipedia says "one should cite sources" that the "should" isn't a "must," and the scientific point of view comes into serious use. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 14:17, 11 November 2005 (UTC)


:: You are not a serious party, Mr. Balhard.
:: I am trying to be of good faith, and I feel like you dont.

:: You say:
::: ''I didn't invent it. I just compiled it from sources. - Mr. B''
:: You are back into metaphysics, it seems.

:: You say: 
::: ''This is anot true. Only you, powo, have made such alienated claim. - Mr. B''
:: Either you lie, or you are amnesiac! Other users who have expressed themselves are either agains your definition or in favour of the one I (we) propose, they are:
:: * Wouter Lievens 
:: * Stan
:: * Mpeisenbr
:: * FOo

:: You say:
::: ''You have stated that definition is a contradiction. I have found otherwise. - Mr. B''
:: Your definition implies: computer science is [(STRONGLY RELATED TO COMPUTERS) and (A SCIENCE WHICH IS CENTURIES OLD)]
:: Dijksra's citations says (STRONGLY RELATED TO COMPUTERS) is not true.
:: Feynman's implies (A SCIENCE WHICH IS CENTURIES OLD) is not true.
:: Since when does the conjunction of two false becomes true???

:: I am new to Wikipedia. I have made a few contributions from place to place, but the most time I have spent arguing with you, and I am starting to be tired of it. I feel like it's a waist of time. Your attitude is like a demonstration of the limitations of Wikipedia... I am criticizing your attitude because your last remarks lack good faith, which is a shift from your previous posts. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 16:47, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

About the contradiction thing, I agreed with Dijkstra that it wasn't about computers as in his quote. Instead, computers still are significant to determine the constitution of the science.

You've noticed the humor and questioned my seriousness. I knew one wouldn't take it too seriously, but this is real. Without the need to remorse on questionable seriousness, let this discussion lighten a bit.

==== Physics, Computers, and Cybernetic Biotechnology ====

I read some articles to try to grasp your point of view more. I read the ones which express computer science isn't a science. Perhaps, it'll help to relate our arguments easier. One thing I've noticed in such "not science" arguments is that they only limit their subjects to high-level practices instead of lower-level tangents to physics. It is those lower-level pieces that allow the higher-level to exist. When people walk up to a computer, they see the higher-level machine. They have no clue what happens at the low-level. Much hard work has been done to automate the computations and the physics. We don't use big clanky steam powered machinery, anymore, for our day to day web browser! It's like something magical to non computer users.

Non computer users tend to seperate realty between what a computer is and not. A non computer user would never allow themselves to be considered a computer. The computer today, however, was very much intended to replace the computer, which was human, of yesterday.

The whole process to replace the (human) computer (or to automate computations) into machinery started computer science. It's not about the computer. It's about what can be done to replace the computer. Although mathematics was used heavily, artificial intelligence was more significant in computer science. Those that argue computation (mathematically) is what computer science is about also tend to argue that the science started well before physics. Since computers performed many physics based calculations, I doubt that is true. We could argue that artificial intelligence started way before computer science, but it couldn't be scientifically prooven until the tangents between physics and computer science existed, which they do now. Those tangents are the foundations of computer science.

One earlier psuedo artificial intelligence shown was the abacus. It wasn't a computer. It was a state machine, memory. People had to physically move the beads into their positional states. It served as a memory device to allow one perform other calculations. Pencils and pens are much more abundant now, we don't need the abacus anymore. It wasn't much of artificial intelligence because the abacus didn't think for itself. The abacus had a computer to think, and the abacus was the the computer's memory. It was a physical device which science can proove works.

My fascination is with cybernetic biotechnology. Computer science really doesn't exist yet until we have fully proven computers (the non human kind) can think for themselves. Until then, we have cybernetic biotechnology. Until then, we still have human computers because to compute means to think, and yesterday's machinery still hasn't thought by itself. We do have solid foundations of computer science, fortunately. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 00:34, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

==== Cleanup ====

I just did a bit of a cleanup edit, mainly affecting the summary which was really terrible (sorry...). Some quick notes:
* If you want to argue about the definition of computer science you can now do so here: [[Definition of computer science]] .. have fun. I created it, moved content over, and linked it in very prominently.
* The history section needs work. The material here should be moved to [[History of computing]] and then that article should be re-summarized here.
* There's a LOT of duplication between "Fields of computer science" and "Major fields of importance for computer science"... (and the second one, is just a list, which should probably be done with a category or something)
* Etc....
[[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 08:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:Not really an improvement. This article should be a substantive summary of the field, not an index of links. The definition is exactly appropriate for this article, not a separate article; if you delete the unsourced and unsupported  opinions of amateurs, it's really not that complicated. But I'm tired of people mangling this article, so I think I'm going to take it off my watchlist - have at it. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 14:17, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
::The argument about the definition should not be carried out in the summary of the article. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 00:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

Sbwoodside, I'm glad you tried to do this layout. We should merge the defintions back into the article.

I thought about how we could smoothly gather the different view points without worry. I remember that I read computer science was originally based on principles rather than a discipline. The discipline began later within academia. Perhaps to point out the principles and the transition to the discipline is easier than a definition in opener. One of the easiest principles to pick out is to automate computation. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 15:19, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

Not really an improvement in my opinion either. You say CS is mainly concerned in the development of software, I am of the opinion that software development is neither computer science, nor science at all. Gee, development of software is (computer) science? Like developing a... word processor??? No way! You say computer data structure is one of the two main areas of CS? In the university I am in, I can only think of one course on data strcture. (Whereas I agree there are at least...hum 1,2,3,4...5 course on algorithmics I can think of straight away...).
What do you mean, is it one of the areas where the biggset achievements have been made, one of the most active research areas? Maybe you are right, but I did not have this impression...--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 19:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

There are two sides to software that would fit science and non-science. Most of the higher-level software hides all the tangible physics of what software accomplishes in its operations. Beyond that it becomes math, database theory, cognitive theory, art, protocols, etc. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 23:09, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:Another view: I am involved with the Wikipedia 1.0 project, and this article is one of about 160 we have listed as a [[Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Core_topics|core topic]] (a "must have") for the print/CD version of Wikipedia. I am not an expert in this field, but I agree with the assessment from a few weeks back by a colleague on the project, "Usable, much of it is a list, no refs."  I wonder if it would be possible to (a) distil some of the content of textbooks in the field to describe the main aspects (this would provide some references too) and (b) rewrite some of the long lists in another more encyclopedic format? I suspect a lot of this could be done without controversy and disagreement. Thanks, [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 06:18, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

==== Can we all agree on anything? ====

OK, so let's see if we can agree on any of the following (some third party, some mine) statements at all. I'll break them down into small bits that we can individually analyse.

1. Computer science is ''"the branch of engineering science that studies (with the aid of computers) computable processes and structures"'' ([http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&o0=1&o6=&o1=1&o5=&o4=&o3=&s=computer%20science WordNet])
* (a) a "branch of engineering science" agree or not?
::No. CS has roots in physics. Engineering doesn't cover the lower-level of computer science. There is a CS that is a branch of E. - Mr. B
:::CS roots are in physics? I thought mainly math [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 02:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
* (b) "studies with the aid of computers" agree or not?
::No. The aid is a related benifit. - Mr. B
* (c) "studies computable processes and structures" agree or not?
::No, but I agreed that is a subject within computer science. - Mr. B

2. Computer science is ''"the study of computers, including their design (architecture) and their uses for computations, data processing, and systems control. The field of computer science includes engineering activities such as the design of computers and of the hardware and software that make up computer systems. It also encompasses theoretical, mathematical activities, such as the…"'' ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109626?query=computer%20science&ct= britannica])
* (a) "the study of computers" ?
::No. Another subject of CS. - Mr. B
:::I tend to agree with you... unless it means "the study of theoretical computers" (e.g. Von Neumann machines, Turing machines, etc.) and even then, it's just a "branch" [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 02:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
* (b) most important aspects are "design (architecture), computations, data processing, and systems control" ?
::No. Importance of those issues depends on interests or requirements. QA isn't interested in any of those. - Mr. B
* (c) includes "design of computers and hardware" ?
::Yes it includes it. - Mr. B
:::Wouldn't that be computer engineering or electrical engineering?
* (d) includes "design of software" ?
::Yes it includes it. - Mr. B
* (e) includes "engineering activities" ?
::Yes it includes it. - Mr. B
* (f) includes "theoretical activities" ?
::Yes it includes it. - Mr. B
* (g) includes "mathematical activities" ?
::Yes it includes it. - Mr. B

3. General issues:
* (a) computer science is a branch of science ?
::No. It is a science on a different foundation. I'll explain more later. - Mr. B
:::Well, I would say CS definitely does NOT use the [[scientific method]] therefore it's not a branch of science. The name computer science is basically a misnomer. But what is it a branch of then? Mathematics? Or is it just what it is, a new discipline that doesn't fit into an already present niche? [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 02:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
* (b) computer science is a branch of mathematics ?
::No. Math has been a major tool of computer science. - Mr. B
* (c) computer science includes the act of creating software ?
::No on principle but yes on discipline. - Mr. B
* (d) computer science includes the theories of computing ?
::Yes on discipline. - Mr. B
* (e) computer science is the study of computing or computation ?
::Yes on discipline no on principle. - Mr. B
:::What do you mean? [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 02:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:The computer science definition is obviously much argued. I believe the scientific point of view is of use besides [[WP:NOR]] to determine the best definition, as there seems to be no majority consent to any specific definition. Based on the scientific points, we know the computer science has principles as well as it became a discipline. I'm sure the difficult part is that we are pretty familiar with the slang associated with computer science and computers. We can make it a clear description of computer science and avoid a definition of endless edit wars. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 15:16, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

Looks like somebody needs to look up what the word "transpire" means. It means "breathe", with the metaphorical meaning of "to whisper a secret" or "to let the true story come out". It doesn't mean to begin or to be founded upon somethng, and it wasn't even minimally appropriate in the way that it was being used in the intro. Reverted. --[[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] 06:44, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

YA new summary then. I've tried to merge the positive points of the long-standing old summary [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_science&action=edit&oldid=10201356] with the summary that was just reverted by Fubar Obfusco because of the incorrect (I agree) use of the word transpire, and with my own previous addition of the word "theoretical"... to distinguish between hardware and software, which are arguably (and I think) practical concerns, and the theoretical part of CS, which is huge of course, which may not actually get into implementation as a major concern. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 07:25, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

It seems to me the current definition is too much of the type: there is "software, hardware, the rest is theory".
Software engineering is not part of computer science, but part of computer engineering. The big bag called "theory"
in the current definition is in fact CS. Algorithmics, for example, is not theory: its the heart of CS. Computer Scientists have a very precise definition of what theoretical Computer Science is, probably its kernel is ''algorithmic complexity''. Broadly speaking, Computer Science is the science that studies computation. "Computation" is a word which had fallen out of use, and it was revivified to describe the new discipline that emerged since mid XX century, a new discipline that ''did not exist before''. Please forget any definition ment to include archaic definition of computers. BTW numerical analysis is not part of CS, its part of maths. Please do realise that CS and computer engineering are not the same, although they are siamese-sisters, sometimes called CS&E. When people talk of CS as an engineering science, they are talking of CS&E, which is allright, but we should know what we do... Also, some huge confusion comes from the fact that Computer Science (a concept, thus the capital letters) can not be understood by looking at the definition of both words, and that people abusively use "computer science" to talk of anything related to (modern,digital) computers. Computer Science is a science, thus computer scientists are scientist: they do research, publish papers, contribute to science, etc... The rest is not computer science. Most people who where trained as computer scientists do not work as computer scientists, because as in every science, a drastic selection is made at each step. The confusion comes from the fact that CS is so closely related to computer technology, abusively called computer science. CS is what is being tought in CS departements of universities. Since there is all this confusion, we could include it in a [[NPOV]] spirit, but the fundamental definition should be clear, simple, and broad: CS is the science that studies computation.--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 22:18, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:Powo, what the first sentence says now: "Computer science is a discipline that deals with all areas of computation" seems like it's effectively the same statement. As far as the rest of it goes, it's clear that we can't please everyone. As you say, in the spirit of NPOV, we have to include the operational summary even if it's not the definition a purist might choose. I think that it's worth covering that there's a disagreement over the definition - especially in [[Definition of computer science]]. The problem that arises is when that discussion becomes a barrier to having a useful summary for newcomers to the topic. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 04:24, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:: Yes, sure I agree to your sensible point of view. I have looked at the CS page in french. It is broad too... In french, CS translates to "informatics". The term "Informatics" is not not as implicitely related to the scientific aspects of CS as the term "Computer ''Science''" is. So... maybe it could be explained that in different context, CS englobes more or less. The two extremes being academic and popular language contexts. However, my non NPOV is that emphasis should be more on the academic side than on the popular language side.--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 08:32, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

To end this section about "transpired," yes it doesn't have a single definition. It does have a definition that works very well, but as we see that is disagreement about it's use. I could have replaced "transpired" with "became known," and leave out the ambiguosity. It is a good example show a kind-of logic antonym to use against the word "study" or "discipline." Anotherwords, Computer science doesn't have a single definition, like to study computation. A body of knowledge is knowledge, not a discipline. The discipline is a tool. The expression "Computer Science" has become the formal title of the academic discipline since it represents the body of knowledge as its principle to exist. That is simple. Others here make it seem so hard to understand the difference between a title of a discipline and the meaning of the expression to be a body of knowledge. 

I'm gald there is progress here to understand what we all want. There is almost no revert war (like the ones that happen more then once a day). At least we try to improve others work instead of complete revert. Do recognize this as progress. However, to call each other amatuers is or other names is immature. It's only intention is obviously the same as pychopathic bullies. Settle down I say to those that know what that meant.

As proven there computer science translates to information technology or such in other languages, we will continue to see arguements from all sides of what computer science really is about. I'll still stand that the definition I added is works well, but it is obviously to simple for other to understand. It is obviously a definition that I mistakenly added that only logical computer scientists can agree to its point. It's in the same position when I or other really good programmers run into when they write code, the code is easily understood by other really good programmers, but others want a translation, like code comments. Like I said many times, I compiled it from diverse sources. I found none that purely agreed with one another.

Powo, I'm glad that you pointed out you think there are only two extremes to only explain computer science, academics and popular contexts. There are more. The discipline isn't all in academia, as there are the technocratic institutions. That isn't to imply technocracy doesn't involve academics in function, but there are systems to use the body of knowledge of computer science without the help of academic institutions or outside of what would be the academic realm. Becuase of that, I'm against to make the article not include anything that isn't specifically of academia. ---- [[User:Jhballard|Mr. Ballard]] 15:14, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

My bad, it appears that [[History of computing]] isn't about computer science at all, but more like the history of bean counting and calculating the values of functions.

=== Physical phenomena or mathematical introspection? ===

A posteriori, it seems to me the discussion has taken a new turn from this point.
A definition was introduced which could be summarized as implying that a computation is a physical phenomena,
and that CS therefore is a study of the physical world. C.f. herunder for details. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 22:31, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

==== Complete definition or description of Computer Science ====

I've consulted more sources beyond dictionary (or encyclopedic) entries to find a more complete definition of computer science. Currently a few wikipedians agree to a definition:
:''Computer science (abbreviated CS or compsci) is an academic discipline that deals with all areas of computation, both in theoretical terms, and in hardware and software.''
That only seems to cover a popular subset of computer science, and I hate to see the definition fall short. I don't intend to remove the popular course, but I want to nail this down more. I know that "deals with all areas of computation" doesn't quite cover it since a computation, its mechanical structure, is the result of the research. I know what its intention is meant to cover, but we can improve it. Computer Science is science that also ecompasses the popularity of the engineers work. That popularity is the obvious confusion and is not a means to make the article emphasize only those aspects. The article should point out the difference between computer scientist and computer science engineers. We can still do this with an academic emphasis.

I like to point out some things to consider. Computation is commonly performed by algorithmic tasks, and definition of algorithm has heavily influenced the definition of computation, unfortunately. Also, computation is very similar to the word computer since they both start with "comput-". These are obscurities. Some have used the word ''automaton'' instead of the word ''computation''. The word automaton isn't definined like computation but follows the same principles. The word is useful to avoid obscurities.

Here is one proposal for the opener:

:'''Computer science''' is an academic discipline based on the mechanization of computability. CS involves the design of computer systems and their application to science, industry and management. The CS discipline includes the fundamentals of computer languages, operating systems, and the formal mathematical tools required to use the computer in solving complex tasks. CS has a popular engineering aspect that emphasizes more on computer hardware and software interaction and includes knowledge of electronics, also known as Computer Science & Engineering. The core academic program in CS covers theory, hardware and software. 

I like to add a little more, but that expands the opener a bit. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:41, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Not bad! But what do you mean by based on the ''mechanization of computation''? This is obscure to me...--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 16:18, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Although you didn't give a reason why you thought it is obscure, we should expand on it since ''mechanization'' has an unintended influence on the word. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 20:33, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:This is an awful paragraph. "mechanization of computation" doesn't make any sense (what is a "nonmechanical computation"? is binary search not O(log n) if you do it by hand?). What is "popular engineering"? Singling out languages and OS is misleading, those are just a couple specialties, and the "solving complex tasks" bit is meaningless filler. The "science, industry, and management" sounds like it came out of a recruiting brochure, and the repeated references to hardware put too much emphasis on what is better characterized as computer engineering. There's a reason why I originally defined as just "study of computation" - more elaborate definitions will invariably exclude a well-known part of the field. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 20:36, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

::It stated "mechanization of '''computability'''" and not "computation." Another source indicated "The mechanization of abstraction"  which seemed like mathematics or artificial intelligence. Again, the "study of computation" is not a consensual definition among verifiable and reputable publications. I used the program descriptions of a few universities in different areas (not some hyperbolic recruiting brochure). "Hardware" was mentioned as much as "software." I like to use the definition from the thesis but the words then meant a specific idea. Maybe we can agree to accept a modern version that is modified slightly from the thesis to make it simply clear. "Computer Science is an academic discipline based on the science of purely mechanical processes and computability." I would use "Turing machine" but we know over time that "consciousness" and its obscurity from physical reality is still not a proven part of any universal machine, and Turing emphasized that a human that performs effective methods is a form of a universal machine and not the human itself. The "consciousness" part is, therefore, left out of Computer Science. Since mathematics is based on learning and learning is a part of consciousness, that differentiates mathematics from computer science. This is why we also can not use the phrase "that deals with all areas of computation" because it's not cleary delimited from consciousness. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 23:13, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

It seems to me the word computation already implicitely refers to CS. The reason (this should be checked) is that the word computation had fallen in desuetude, and was revified with the emergence of CS. I like the definition of stan: the study of computation, it is broad yet specific to CS. Perfect fo the intro... I think there is a concensus in the comunitiy about this type of definition. E.g. "procedural epistemology" was proposed. Is this not (although more esotheric) very close to "the study of computation"? It seems to me "computation", "procedural", "mechanical" or "causal", etc... are all almost synonyms in the constext of CS.
However, "mechanical" is clearly not standard terminology, so I would porefer a definition based on procedure or, even better, computations: a word which was invented (more precisely, taken out of desuetude) just for CS!--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 09:09, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:You seem to imply it isn't so easy. Alas. "Epistemology" is philosophical, and so is the phrase "study of computation." They work great for those that already know or follow the philosophy, but they fail to explain anything to someone unfamiliar with the discipline. Simple catchy phrases always have that problem. Another problem is that it influences science as if it was philosophical instead of some solid organization, and I'm sure we don't want to make that mistake.

"Computation", "mechanical", and "effective" have stated synonym attributes only if one reads about CS in depth, but we still have to aim for the audience that never has read about CS. We can't assume that the readers know that the words in use are only for the context of CS or any particular article. We can, however, use such words in such a way if they are stated in the article to be used in such a way. I want to expand "purely mechanical process" a bit to make it less ambiguous on "mechanical." There seems to be heavy debate in past published papers on just what the universal machine can do, and it all relates as if to question the domain of the physical world or beyond. Certainly, the description of the universal machine allowed an assumption of metaphysics, but the debate (e.g. Church and Gandy) clearly states it works only by "effectively calculable" means. Therefore, if we add something like "''based on the science of computability (i.e. "what can be computed," "how can it be computed," or "that which is computed") by purely physical forces and bodies''" would make it more clear. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 14:28, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:All very amusing, but not suitable in the lead, which is for, as you say, the general reader. "Study of computation" does sound like a slogan, but for instance you can't add "scientific study" because many of the subfields work more like engineering or math, and "mechanical computation" has some very misleading connotations. Following paragraphs do have to expand on the  concept, describing what kinds of things fall under "study" and what falls under "computation", distinguishing it from computer engineering. But there is a rule of thumb that readers fall away with each additional line of text, so the first line needs to be succinct. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 14:43, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

Only the lead paragraphs need to be brief, but the first line doesn't need to be so succinct. The first line needs to be clear description. For example, look at peer review:

:'''[[Peer review]]''' (known as '''refereeing''' in some academic fields) is a scholarly process used in the publication of manuscripts and in the awarding of money for research.

That is even more than:

:'''Computer science''' (abbreviated '''CS''' or '''compsci''') is an academic discipline based on [[computability]] by physical [[force|forces]] and [[physical body|bodies]].

:"physical forces and bodies"? That's just bizarre. I defy you to find one single definition published by an expert that mentions that. CS is the study of [[computing]] in the same way that [[entomology]] is the study of [[insect]]s - one article is about the thing itself, the other article is about the human activity of thinking about the thing. (Oh, and the "peer review" definition is a loser too - it does nothing to explain either the "peer" part or the "review" part, just says what is for, like saying "a car is an object used to go to the mall or to the beach".) [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 20:58, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

::You spoke (or typed) to soon. I already described above where "physical forces and bodies" came from. It is part of the definition of "mechanical" and "effective." Of course, those words have more definitions added to them since the time that Turing's thesis was written, so its best to just explain the simple definition of what was meant then, so we can avoid the continuously debated historical aspect of the words. Do read the thesis and the various peer reviews of it to gain more insight.

"One article is about the thing itself, the other article is about the human activity of thinking about the thing." -- Oh, so computing is about thinking and you think that CS is about thinking about "thinking?" That's bizarre. Try the cognitive sciences for that.

Stan, you may be able to program, but I believe you don't really understand what you program at the very low-level. There is that point where all operations done by a computer require some sort of physical activity and interaction with the real world, and that activity and the ability to make the physical world compute what we want is what Computer Science is all about. You, however, think it is only about computing or computation, and you've shown it is nothing about the physical world.

:::Heh, you '''did''' look closely at my user page, right? I was lecturing undergrads twenty years ago about the definition of CS, I know all the ins and outs of the issue. A reference to physicality can be a convenient way to explicate the notion of effective computability, otherwise novices will handwave and assume infinite time or space is available when talking about algorithms. However, for the everyday work of languages or AI or databases, it's an uninteresting boundary, sort of like a person in Kansas not knowing or caring exactly how far north Alaska extends. We already have an article on [[computability]], so we just need to refer interested persons to it, not attempt to repeat it in an oversimplified way. On the distinction between computing and CS, you brought it up, so I don't know why you're finding X and meta-X confusing; as my example pointed out, many other areas in WP make the distinction between topic and the study of that topic, so apparently a lot of other editors have no problem with the concept. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 07:16, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

::::Software engineers are not suppose to worry about space and time limitations when they design their programs, and the assumption is infinite space and a reasonable time. That assumption is not true, however, for any type of lower-level design. Perhaps, the signifigance of such boundary hasn't occurred to you yet.

It is written about several times through the Church-Turing thesis, its peer reviews, and its derived works. It's clear the intention was to bind the limits of computability to just the physical domain. The thesis states the universal machine can compute anything, and it further limits its computations to purely mechanical descriptions. I find this very simple, and I have known it for more than 20 years, also. Their was already a system to compute anything that existed before any notion of Computer Science. If you remove the physical limits of Computer Science, you remove the science, and you have then the point you have tried to make. 

One thing you'll find of interest is a point made by the Turing test, and recent articles have not emphasized the point as when I learned about the Turing test 20+ years ago. It had a different perspective then. The point was not if the computer could emulate human like conversation, but the point was, given the technology then, could someone tell the difference between the electronic computer and a human being under a viel. The viel, given the technology then, was simply what was available -- three terminals where the "judge," the "computer," and the "human" could not see or hear each other and were limited to just the screen conversation. That was very possible scenerio centuries ago. Turing didn't seem to state some future possibility of a "holodeck," like in Star Trek, and the "judge" could personally see, hear, touch, talk, or smell and the "human" and the "computer," a solid holographic personage. Recent articles don't seem to emphasis the consciousness part. The conscious part of human is generally an exception to physics. Because of that exception, the limits of the universal machine were stricly set to the physical world. Turing reiterated the thesis in a way that subtracts consciousness: human clerks that only had pen and paper to follow instructions of effective methods. Anotherwords, the human clerks had to think in order to follow the instructions but they didn't have to be conscious of any decision being made by the instructons. The Turing test pinpoints where the consciousness is, or is not, in the physical world when the test can be really challenged and a result given. If the computer can execute a program that can pass the test, we can assume the the computer has real intelligence or consciousness or both. The computer, if fails otherwise, neither has consciousness nor real intelligence. Obviously, Turing went on in his life to try to create a better machine that could go beyond his universal machine, yet his work was incomplete with his "life" program. These are the reasons why he has been noted as the Father of Computer Science rather then any other significant work done by those who mastered computation before and after him. He tried to create, or program, "life." Is it a pun to call him a "father" for "life" program he did make? No, it just makes it that much more simple to understand Computer Science and what it is about. His work may be completed someday, "given enough time to program" it. For now by science, the consciousness is not part of Computer Science. Computation may generally require conscious decisions to be made, but those parts of compuation, hence, are not Computer Science. Do we need to write examples here about example instructions of computation that would require conscious decisions? If we do, ask yourself are these instructions computable by today's technology? Will they be computable by some future technology?

That is what computability conquers. And, that is why Computer Science limits itself to the physical domain -- to conquer it. There is computation, and there is reality. Seriously, tell me everything that we can't compute if and only if by purely physical forces and bodies, and I'll tell you what is not Computer Science. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:31, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:You've kind of drifted off into the weeds here with your personal theories; [[Church-Turing thesis]] has a better description.

::These aren't personal theories. I've read that wikipedia article of the Church-Turing thesis, and it only covers a select amount of information from the paper. Software engineers personally can worry about space and time, but in terms of the software they engineer the assumption is still infinite space and reasonable time. Other devices exist to worry about the space and time factors. The proper way to build a string append method is to not even have to worry about space, as software engineer should assume their is always enough space. Other devices, like the kernel or hypervisors, can worry about the space factors and alert the program if it wants to receive such alert. It's improper to build a string append method that checks for space usage at every instruction. They used to check extraordinarily like that, but "given enough time to program" we have other devices now that do the job. I was originally taught to program without the aid of a computer.

:::Do you actually work on software for a living? If we're even the tiniest bit sloppy about memory usage in GDB, the symbols in a real-life program like Final Cut Pro completely blow out the symbol table and bring the whole machine to its knees, just to mention one of my current problems.

::::Yes. Virtual Machines as a dynamic compiler in a run-time environment are my technical fascination. I've implemented one, with a static core, to help automate loan documents. It was part of a system that generated $5B dollars worth of loans in 3 months. Anyways, something like Final Cut Pro is bounded to a finite machine, the hardware layer. That would mean the Software Engineer must go above and beyond expectations and use hardware skills -- memory device mangement. A pure software engineer should think in terms of the universal machine, an "infinite tape." An engineer is about "human needs," and the software engineer are to design software to those human needs. We still have many of these so called software engineers that hit the hardware when they program, and they put the hardware needs before the priority of human needs, so they essentially aren't pure software engineers. With Final Cut Pro, this is the typical dilemma you also face. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 22:56, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

Just to remind people - the summary is not a good place to put your personal view of what Computer Science is. It needs to be clear, readable, comprehensible by a wide ranging audience (including non-technical people), and holistic on the topic. I think that the proposed change fails in a number of those areas. Dzonatas - if you think that there's something wrong with the [[Church-Turing thesis]] page, then make changes there. Since the summary of this article is so controversial, changes to it are likely to be hotly contested. The summary should reflect at this point be deliberately written to reflect a consensus view - things that we can all agree on. Which I think it currently does.

:The lead, or summary, as it stands on the page is original research. There is no source to it. Even a vote by wikipedians to a specific summary is still original research. The summary does not reflect the limits of Computer Science. It makes Compute Science appear more like mathematics, which it is not.

Dzonatas, what makes you think this definition is refering to information technology, besides the word information in it? From what I understood when reading the article in which the acm gives this definition, they are trying to define what CS academic cursus should include, and they come to the conclusion that CS and CE are different yet so closely related that no CS training can exclude a CE training an vice-versa. They finally define the union of CS and CE as "the discipline of computing", for which they propose the above defintion.--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 09:53, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

Powo, the document states beforehand another definition of the body of knowledge of computer science, and then it later states the discipline of computing an a definition for that. It's pretty clear to use "computer science" and "computing" in different contexts, but the article doesn't specifically point them out. It does state a difference as to "what can be automated" as opposed to the computability aspect as "what can be computed." The article further explains that it hints and highlights divisions of the science, and it doesn't seem to specifically set any bounds on computer science, but it does on computing. It also considered the physical sciences a newer addition to CS than other foundations, but past papers have shown the physics and physical sciences are in strong relation. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:36, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

Here is a bunch of remarks, in hope it will help going forward. These are my personal POV's, and I have no claim that they are universally accepted!

- It seems to me that it is more usual to compare CS to mathematics than to physics. In this sens, the point of view of Dzonatas is minoritary, because it seems to emphasize strongly on the fact that a computation is a physical phenomena.

- Clearly, a computation is a '''mathematical object'''. A typical prototype is what follows from a TM, though there are other models, more or less equivalent (c.f. [http://weblog.fortnow.com/2005/11/history-of-ram.html|The history of RAM] for differences between RAM and other models). ''Plenty mathematical models of computations, extensive litterature, etc... abound in this direction.''

- In my opinion, the point of view of Dzonatas is no nonsens: a computation can be a '''physical phenomenon'''. However, this is a ''far less common way of thinking of a computation''. What exactly is a physical computation is fuzzy. However a core of physical phenomenon, I believe, would make immediate concensus. E.g. what happens inside a digital computer is clearly a physical computation. But there is more than that to be putted into the bag of physical computations. I have no knowledge of work defining what a computation is from the physical point of view. The more interesting and exotic example I can think of was an article I read in an EATCS bulletin, where comutation where done by a chemical reaction in test tubes... Ultimately, and without much meaning in my opinion, it has been previously claimed on this talk page that every physical phenomenon is a computation, because the world itself is a computer. (I disagree with tgoing in that direction, its metaphysics, not science in my opinion).

It seems to me CS is a particular science: very much like mathematics, however with a strong link to a physical world. In the point of view (my interpretation) of [[instrumentalism]], one difference between CS and physics is that, contrary to physics, CS started by being a purely T-term science, with no real O-terms and statements. 
Another difference is that the O-terms studied by CS are not natural, but constructed by humans.
On the other hand CS studies computation and computations are T-terms , but also O-terms. On the contrary, probably mathematics has no O-terms, which makes CS different from mathematics. In fact, under some definitions of science, it could be argued this makes CS a science while mathematics are not a science.

Sumarizing, I think CS is well defined as the ''study of computation'', computation being both a mathematical object and a physical object. However, the current definition(s) put(s) a strong emphasis on the physical part (mostly because of the word ''mechanical''), in accordance with the point of view of those who defended this definition. This is a non [[NPOV]] and should be tempered.
Further in the article, the existence of physical computations and computations as mathematical objects could be explained, and [[instrumentalism]] may be a good inspiration. BTW, if I was quizzed about what the ''extent of mechanistic explanation'' is, I dont think I would find out it is refereing to CS! --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 21:47, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

It wasn't point to state computation as a physical phenomenon. Computation, however, involves a greater deal then just the physical domain, and that is my point. Whereas, computer science is bounded by the physical domain; therefore, a subset of computation is a phenomena in computer science. (I'll respond more, later...) &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 23:47, 30 November 2005 (UTC)


==== "extent and limitations of mechanistic explanation"?????!!!!! ====

Is this ridiculous or what? Here we have an article about a ''core topic'' that other people in Wikipedia are saying  is one of the most important articles in the wikipedia, and every day there's a crazy new summary? I have a degree in CS and I have to read pages and pages of arguments to find out what the heck "mechanistic" means and here it is in the ''first sentence'' of the whole article.

Dzonatas and others, ''please'' read [[WP:LEAD]]. 
:''The lead should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it could stand on its own as a concise version of the article.''
Does this article explain what "mechanistic explanation" is? No, it does not! So if you're going to stick that in the lead, write a section on it, explaining what it means -- first!

Please -- the summary of this article '''should follow the guidelines in [[WP:LEAD]]''' -- and if it isn't, I consider that good grounds for reversion. Which I am now going to do with the "mechanistic" bit. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 05:36, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

The article doesn't define "mechanistic explanation" redundantly as a dictionary, no. It does touch basis to relate where the expression starts. Computation isn't defined, as you say, in the article, so I wonder why you reverted to "all areas of computation." However your right, it does need improvement, and to revert to a definition that is propositionally false about computer science doesn't improve the article. I'll take some time to recollect some sources I have come across. In the mean time, various dictionary entries:

These popular dictionaries all have a similar means for the word "mechanistic." It is Turing that stated "purely mechanical, " and it was von Newman that stated "extent and limitations of mechanistic explanation." It is obvious that the physical aspect is significant to computer science. "Computation" can mean procedural calculation or logical method. Turing made such computation more finite as phrased "effectively calculable." Another section that covers these points as well as computation included in general would help. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:34, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

===Brand new uncontroversial(?) definition===

Hi folks. I just added a definition which I tried to make the less controversial. I failed, for sure, however I reacon it is less controversial than the previous one. Here is my proposition:

'''Computer Science''' is a young [[academic discipline]] with roots in
[[mathematical logic]], [[linguistics]] and [[electrical engineering]].
Its very fast development is closely related to the emergence of [[digital computers]],
however it is widely recognised that it does not restrict to the study of computers.
Computer scientists generally agree that the concept of [[computation]] is central to computer science,
and the proposition to define computer science as ''the study of computations'' is not uncommon.
The status of computer science as a [[science]] is often challenged, typically arguing that it is more
like [[mathematics]] and that it would not follow the [[scientific method]], however these facts are not unanimously accepted.
[[Computer Engineering]] (CE) is very closely related to Computer Science, and their frontier is often blurry.
In popular language, the term ''computer science'' is often confusingly used to denominate anything related to computers.

I had it on the main page, and if you dont think it is too bad, maybe we can discuss changes to it on the discussion page and change it slowly after debating it. So, how do you like the definition? What does it miss? How is it erroneous? Best, --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 20:49, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

Good information. The entire article doesn't cover most of that, and as sbwoodside suggested we're close to an agreement. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]]

I think at this point it's not a good idea to rewrite the summary completely since we seem to be (maybe) converging on a consensus. So, I reverted it... I did use the second half of what you wrote though to rewrite my disclaimer on the definition of CS. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 21:13, 2 December 2005 (UTC)


Hmmm... Folks, from a logical point of view, your arguments are fully sensible. But I question the premisses: I think we are very far from an agreement. Sorry.

* What  the heck does the first sentence mean? ''...a body of knowledge of computer hardware..'' (Besides the poor english, but that's a detail)
* I find the first sentence to be completely confused, and fairly inacaurate: it mixes at the same level the concepts of ''hardware and software'', ''computation'' and ''theory'', which have little in common.It seems like a bag of words lined up in the same sentence with no meaning (''body of knwoledge about x,y,z...'')
* Second sentence is just as bad: ''...it encompasses a wide variety of topics...'' (how could a sentence be more trivial?), followed by a random list: e.g. ''formal grammars'' (a very specific topic) and ''algorithms'' (a very unspecific topic) are the two first examples!
* I feel my proposition is much better than the version you reverted to: if the current version would be uncontroversial, it could only follow from its voidness in contempt, probably as a result of the too numerous twists and shifts it had to endure. At this point, there most be no other way than restarting from scratch. Any scratching attempt, in the current controversary climate, should be driven by a strict [[NPOV]] spirit. This is what I tried to do. Please crtiticise my proposition and improve it, it needs to be! But IMHO we need to remove the current weak, amorphous and unscholary definition ASAP (this I'll do!).

Is this not far from an agreement hey?! 
Kind regards, --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 21:56, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

Ok, so you want to keep going with the previous (bad IMHO) definition. So let me please challenge you:
* What is this: ''...formal mathematical tools in use by the computer...'' 
::How do you want to state how the computer uses computer languages, operating systems, and mathematics. - D
::: I dont know. Let me please be intentionally critical: There are no mathematical tools in use by the computer! If you disagree, tell me what are these tools. In the current opening, ''mathematical'' is used in the most vague sens. This is ambiguous and bad.
* The formulation ''...These fundamentals lead to...'' looks like a word is missing...
::Not really. We could add something to make it more clear. "The study of these fundamentals lead to..." - D
::: The study of these fundamental what? Subfields? Central fields? Essential disciplines?
* By what random selection process were specific fields like ''formal grammars'' and ''artificial intelligence'' chosen in favour to, e.g. ''computational models'' and ''data mining''... (Basically, I think we should removed specific examples, they are arbitrary. We should be able to come to a more abstract definition, examples can be left for later).
::These were the examples already present in the opener. Some editors have stated that want to see specific examples. - D
* Since when is computer engineering part of CS? This HAS to be avoided, because it it typically VERY controversial.
::I'm surprised you questioned that one. That is why the sentences starts out as "leads to" because not everybody studies all those topics when they study CS. - D
::: I prefered a lot the much more NPOV sentence ''closely related to CE''. This can not be argued: it is a fact!
We are not finished yet! Hopefully we'll make it in the end.
Best regards: --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 01:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Your opener doesn't give me a definition or clear description, but it does give me historic information. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 11:46, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Basically, my opening saiz:
* CS has to do with academia, maths, linguistic, electronical engineering, computers, computations, science and computer engineering.
These are uncontroversial facts. This is an abstract high level definition. Maybe have I missed some important points. 
* Additional information about the above uncontraversial facts comes from the structure and semantic of the sentence, which tries to shed some light on how it is related to these facts. 
* Furthermore, I have tried to have an NPOV by including both sides of the coin to any additional information.

Whereas my proposition is structured, it seems like the current definition is clumsy, adding parasital information. E.g. "is an academic discipline,'' a body of knowledge''". The fact that it is a body of knowledge is trivial! It lacks structure: it enumerates random disciplines, says they are fundamental, and that it leads to (the development? The construction? Again a word missing...) of other disciplines, e.g. algorithmics. In its current form it imlicitely states or at least hints, that ''operating systems is a fundamental discipline that lead to formal languages''. Although I admit this is not explicit, and probably not intended, it shows the clumsiness and unscholarliness of the current definition. It also introduces non NPOVness, since it states some subfields are fundamentals. For example, I dont think OS is a central part of CS at all. First of all, I dont think it is really related to CS, but rather to CE.

We need to structure what we want to put in the opening. I propose the following program:
* Define a list of essential components of CS
* A list of important disciplines closely related to CS
* Then we can rewrite an opening from scratch (or modify the current one, but it is so poor in its current state...). This last part will be articulated around on what we agree as being the essence of CS. Since it needs to be uncontroversial and NPOV, and from what we have agreed so far, I propose "academic discipline". Since this is not completely uncontroversial, it will be balanced by including other acceptions in the text, e.g. popular acception of the word ("anything related to CS?").
--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 12:50, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Why not try to write what you have wanted to explain as part of the body of the article. There is no concrete NPOV definition. We have a lengthly discussion above that screams that fact. What we can do is describe the discipline, its programs, and how it relates to the body of knowledge. Personally, I rather see a more technical definition, but the argument to write for an audience of teenagers wins out. Read the CS programs at universities, and you'll notice that "hardward", "software", "theory" (computation), and "electronics" are the most general terms used to describe what paths to follow. Someone who wants to know hardware and electronics probably wants to be a computer engineer. Someone who wants to know software and theory probably wants to be a software engineer. Someone who wants to know software and hardward probably wants to know about information technology. Add business to that last one and you have a TechnoMBA. These aren't the only examples and by no means are they concrete.

We have a list of specifics in the body -- too many lists. Unfortunately, the article is too much bones and not enough meat. We've discussed many issues above that make great pieces for the body or other articles. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 14:27, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Sure the audience is not only computer scientists (they know what CS is...) but at least the writers should be.--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 19:27, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== Editors of the Article ==

Powo has stated above that the writers of the article should only be computer scientists. Unfortunately, it does not work that way. If there was such a rule, most of the content in wikipedia would never get written because of the tedious job to find someone that would be so consensually deemed qualified to write. That is what non open content encyclopedias do because they get paid for it to hold a certain reputation. That is also their downfall as those encyclopedias lack information from a larger resourceful population. 

Technically punny: if we let this article only be written by computer scientist, then they aren't doing their job. Computer scientist are theorists, researchers, and inventors. They aren't editors, so why are they here? I'm sure the computer scientist that have so professed that their wisdom is so great here that they have judged all others as to be excluded in any attempt to write on the article surely would not let any technical detail such as the benefits of open content to be so unfamiliar to them. Perhaps, those computer scientist that profess such great wisdom should write their own version of wikipedia that prohibits anybody except doctors of philosophy to edit content. They can further provide a website for their content. They could even run their own server for their website. If the information is truly worthwhile, they can put up hit-counters and advertisements and get paid for it. Nevertheless, they have come here but only to tout themselves and taunt others.

Fortunately, wikipedia is much more open than that. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 12:06, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't agree with Powo that only subject-matter experts should contribute to articles, but the ability to write good expository English is imperative. I don't really like to make blanket criticisms, but Dzonatas, your style is consistently impenetrable, both linguistically, and in the lines of argument. In addition, you come across as sure that you're always right about all this. These make a bad mix, because the net effect is that you replace clear text with unclear text, and then aggressively insist that it's an improvement, even if nobody else thinks so. Yes, WP is open enough to let the less-capable undo the work of the more-capable, but this is not considered a feature. WP's official mission is to produce a free encyclopedia, and the wiki process is simply an implementation technique; as with the recent move to disable page creation by anonymous editors, if openness interferes with the official mission, it will be pinched down. I think it's quite likely that at some point, article edits will have to go through a review process, just as is done for patches to GNU, Linux, etc. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 13:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

::I'll admit that I commonly write in a "technical" style. That is still by no means to say that it is bad English. I just use words more based on what they mean rather than how they sound in spoken English. I'm not alone with this trait, as it is common with 45% of  people that are not primarily auditory. What seems clearly written to an auditory person is not always as clear to a kinetic or visual person. Just because there are more auditory people doesn't mean auditory types don't have to improve to also write for kinetic and visual people, and auditory types should recognize this and understand who they call less-capable or more-capable, or even just to go to the point to even suggest that a some degree of a determination be made. A computer scientist that works with artificial intelligence would not ignore these three major differences on how people learn and express themselves. Also, I've have even suggested a version certification process that would help point out article versions that can be accredited or tagged in various ways. It isn't proven, but we could prevent revert wars and encourage more discussion with such process. I agree with you that expository English is imperative, but the existence of two viewpoints doesn't mean only one is right by default. I'm not always right, and I don't try to be perfect, and I don't expect perfection. I expect effort, and I hope you do also. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:42, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

::: What does this mean??? Am I the only one not understanding?--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 16:28, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

:::: This is what I mean by poor English skill - has nothing to do with auditory/visual or any of that. The paragraph above is sorely lacking commas (frequently critical to correct parsing, as in the classic phrase about the panda who "eats, shoots, and leaves"). The garbled "go to the point to even suggest" was probably supposed to be "go to the point of even suggesting" (even my short time in academia involved a certain amount of semantic reconstruction). There are also a number of sidetracks and nonsequiturs (what does AI have to do with anything?). Writing skill is something that has to be cultivated independently of technical ability; a large number of techies just assume that they're doing OK since they never get critiqued by better writers (tech writers know better than to complain, they just quietly fix what they can). [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 00:30, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

::::: Okay. Let me overview your paragraph above and see what I can point out, likewise. In "paragraph...is...lacking commas" is a passive construction. Many colleges do not accept passive voice. Frankly, there is no subject in that sentence. I know professors that would instantly fail an essay based on a single instance of passive voice found in the essay. One way to reword it: "the paragraph lacks commas." On the point of your reworded "suggesting" is a typical inappropriate use of a gerund. If you meant to use it as a noun, it would have been tolerable. The parenthesized phrases have no direct relation to the sentence or phrase for which they are found, so they should be reworded into seperate sentences to state the intended idea clearly. On the point about AI, it was one of many examples I could quickly jot down that demonstrates a relationship to CS knowledge. I've found more to point out, but that is enough. Anyways, lets focus on progress with the article. Please. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 02:01, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[history of computer science]] ==

A new article, since [[history of computing]] didn't cover the right topic. I've written tons of content there already, but it's definitely not finished... since it ends with Turing right now ;-) Anyway, the material here on academics needs to be added to that, and then a summary for here compiled from that article, or whatever. That's my suggestion anyway. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 07:12, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

I inserted the opener below, so we may make some comments about it more easily.

* '''Computer science''', an academic discipline (abbreviated '''CS''' or '''compsci'''), is a body of knowledge generally about [[computer hardware]], [[software]], [[computation]] and its [[theory of computation|theory]].

* The discipline itself includes, but is not limited to, the fundamentals of [[computer languages]], [[operating systems]] and [[mathematics]] in use by the [[computer]].

::::: I'm not sure of how you don't understand what ''in use by the computer'' means. I can make many guesses, but I would like a clue to what you do understand of it. I used the [[University of California, Davis]], pages as a source. An editor didn't like "formal mathematical tools required to use the computer in solving complex tasks" [http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergrad/].  &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 16:49, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

::::::: I dont think there is no such thing as ''mathematics in use by the computer'', or is they?--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 14:21, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::::: Back when computers were people, the people had to know how to apply math. The used math to work through their computations. It applies the same way as a electronic computer. The electronic computer uses math, as it follows a set of instructions to perform calculations. How do you use math? &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 14:54, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:::::::: Back when computers where people??? This sounds pretty much like arguments of Mr. Ballard... Could you and him be the same person? Anyway, computers we are talking about now are not people, and mathematics are not just simple arithmetics. Thus, computers do not do maths. At least, if they do it is in very special cases. This statement in the opener relies on a understanding of computers in an archaic sens and on a wrong understanding of what mathematics are. E.g., whene a computer uses clever techniques to compute the product of two numbers in less than <math>log(n)^2</math>, it doese not "use mathematics", it uses clever arithmetic algorithms. I think it is very unprecise to say that this is "mathematics in use by the computer". This statement is bad, out of the opener it should go. Out of the article in fact! No?--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 18:18, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

Before I take more time giving you explanations which you hardly take into consideration, could you please spend some time rewritting it. Thanks. Until then, I will assume my experise as both a PhD computer scientist and MSc mathematematician justifies taking my point of view on a combined subject on mathematics and CS as more credible than yours , and I will remove the part about mathematics which seems  absurd to me. Best regards. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 20:40, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

::::::::: I'm sure your mastery gives you bold confidence that you are more of an expert than others. That is still no grounds to avoid the question on your page. I rewrote it a couple of times before I saved it, actually. It is not the first time I have seen you avoid my questions. You and others have asked a lot of questions of me. I have helped students learn, and boy oh boy have I gotten some hard questions to answer. I am usually told that I have lots of patience. It makes it very difficult to communicate when you and others point out assumed characteristics about me, like "more expertise than you" or "poor english," rather than just stick to the debate. At least those that I talk with I try to understand. If they avoid questions, I can't understand them. Being able to ask questions and get replies in due response is normal conversation. To tell me that you don't think I am credible or that I'm "hardly understandable" is just not normal conversation. I don't flaunt my degree of computer science, but perhaps I should. Let me give a brief reason why. I learned at the age of 5 how to read technical manuals and how to program computers. I taught myself, at the age of 5, in two days on how to fluently program in BASIC, and I didn't even own a computer. When I did, I quickly moved onto assembly with hardware manual in hand. By the time I was 8, I already programmed many little programs, some games, some utilities, and a BBS. Somewhere around age of 10, people noticed that I used the computer but they all told me the same similar thing you tell me, that I have no expertise (maybe, do you think, cause of my age then). What you say is not new. It doesn't matter what I knew or what I could do -- all that mattered to them is if I had a degree in my hand. Eventually I went to college, and I found out what really meant more than a degree -- the ability to communicate. I used to be an advocate for a pure on-line education system, where students never have to leave their homes to go sit in class and learn. On-line education can not seem to replace the communication that happens within a classroom. Obviously, I already knew how to program when I took my first "how to program" class, but I learned how to "talk" about "how to program" in the class with peers. I never told anybody that I already knew how to program, but it got to that point where upon every assignment everybody asked, "how long did it take you to write that?" I just told the truth. I already learned my lesson, like at the age of 10, when I talked about computers that I seemed like "a know it all," so maybe I should have said "2 weeks" since assignments were due every other week, and others still where at the keys up to the last minute due. Instead I told the truth, I replied "less than an hour." They finally believed me when we sat in lab together. Today, when I meet someone new, I just lie and tell them I don't know anything about computers -- which puts an immediate end to any kind of "know it all" accusation before it even starts. Consider the amount of times I've dropped an English class just to retake it to do it better, I guess you can say I try to get it right when I dropped it for anything less than an "A."  Powo, you tell me I should question myself. Well... hmmmm  okay.. you can have your "aspects of computer science" instead of "in use by the computer." &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 23:18, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

: Some constructive comments:
:* Computer science has less to do with computer hardware than astronomy with telescopes. The computer science curriculum at my university (in the Netherlands) only has one course on hardware. And even that treats it from a software perspective. For example, we studied the effect of CPU caches on algorithms, but not how CPU caches are constructed hardware wise. What you refereing to is computer engineering.
:::* Please, don't make that assumption so fast. I understand the part of hardware that is computer engineering as regards to electronics and material production. There is the other part that is all within the realm of CS under computability. Circuit design, which is considered hardware, is a subject taught under CS, but it doesn't involve any electronic knowledge. A study of circuit material production techniques is not CS. Circuit design is a heavy study of basic logic components. Other than simulators, it doesn't involve the subjects of software. This is just one example. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]]

::: The main point about the mention of the history is so that we can refer to software engineering without, purists complaining that it's not ''really'' computer science (e.g. computer scientist inventing formal methods, software engineers using them). I believe ehey should be mentioned in the introduction, but just saying that computer science would not be as informative.

To be practical (if that's possible), now that I understand what ''in use by the computer'' means, I think that it's a problematic phrase for the summary it will be confusing to the average non-CS reader. It could be used later (with explanation) but in the summary I think it's hard to understand for average people how the computer is using mathematics, since they think of it as a more or less dumb machine. It seems to make more sense to say that the computer scientist is using mathematics. [[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] 00:58, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

==Carreers and demographics==

The statistics given are very interesting. Nice work. I would like to make the following (hopefully constructive) remarks:
* The statistics are not so much about computer scientists, nor even about people who received a training as a computer scientist before doing another job. Could we find statistics about what carreer ''computer scientists'' embrasse? (Obviously, only one in fifth computer programmer received a basic training as a computer scientist).
* These statistics are for the USA. What about other places? (They could be quite different, since e.g. a lot more people have a BS in the states than in Europe).--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 21:31, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

Another remark/question: is the profession of ''web developper'' a profession computer scientists turn to? It seems to me this is more of an adminiastritive job that typically a librarian, administrative employee, secretary, etc... would do part-time besides his normal job, or in the case its a full time job, a self-taught web-developpers or people having followed a few months training (MS trash web develloper trash course or whatsoever), but not computer scientists, no?

== Removal of Career section ==

I move that we completely remove the career section (Computer programmers, database administrators, web developers, etc).  I'm not sure why this topic was included in the first place.

If it's to point potential and current computer science students to career opporunities, then we might as well include technical support into the list, since that's where many CS grads end up.

Or is it because people working in the listed careers are somehow involved in the science of computers?  Certainly nobody is trying to say that the guy who picked up "HTML for Dummies" and has a job designing websites could be considered a computer scientist? [[User:jonovision|jonovision]] 07:39, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

Not everbody who is involved to a degree with computer science is a computer scientist, so we should not make the assertion that the article covers only the scope of computer scientist since it is about computer science. I have found evident that the scope of computer science is much larger and not entirely the same region as the scope of computer scientists. I mean, we assume that everything about computer science is what a computer scientist does. We know that doesn't even hold true for a scientist as compared to science. It is more like philosophy based techniques that are emphasized over boundaries of a belief system since every scientist has a diverse basis for their particular science. It is not easy for a computer scientist to hold title without a graduate degree, but there are lots of people who have worked and added to computer science that aren't academically computer scientist. Academic circles do not always recognize such additions to computer science.

The career section was not just for an audience of potential students, but I did not intend to leave such an audience out. The key feature is the demographics abstract. That is an encyclopediac feature, not just a computer science feature. We could be more detailed about the different position and list every possibility, but that would not be demographic detail. I suggest that we switch the two titles and section text "demographics" and "careers," if that presents the purpose more. If we want more detail, the section can link to other articles.

Yes, people who work in such careers are somehow involved in computer science either passively or actively. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

I'm glad that we can both agree that computer science is a real science.

The [[List of prominent pioneers in computer science|list of contibutors]] can grow quite large if we add too much detail. Perhaps, we can section the list by subdisciplines of CS.

I still don't see how you are distinguishing between computer programmers who contribute to the advancement of the science, and those who merely use the products of the science in their day to day work.

:I agree. On that note, I looked at the page for [[Biology]]. They have a very nice layout for the article. How do you feel if we used something like that to show the principles and the scope of the studies and careers? High-level programmers, network administrators, and database administrators are now taught mainstream under Information Technology rather than CS, so do you think this CS article should only include the low-level aspects? A web developer is like a programmer-analyst position, so we can merge that into the others. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 22:01, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

For an article that covers as much detail as this one does, surely there should be some references listed. I noticed a couple under the demographics section but I was surprised not to see a references section near external links.

==Scientific definition of CS==

The current intro says:

[...
''others have tried to use ''computer science'' to denote specifics related to [[scientific computing|computational science]].''
...]

And ''computational science'' links to ''scientific computing''. However, I think that when one thinks of ''scientific aspects of CS'', one has not scientific computing in mind (which is argualy not even par of CS...) What do editors of this page think?--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 23:58, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

: Foolish change by you know who. change it to <nowiki>[[theory of computation|computation]]</nowiki> until we have a proper introduction. &mdash;''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 00:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

It said until changed:

''others have tried to use ''computer science'' <font style="color:red">as to denominate</font> specifics related to [[scientific computing|computational science]].''

The change obviously left some vagueness in place of the intended redundacy to emphasize a contrast. Powo, your right that the science of computer science is different from the science of computational science. Both sciences do not equally apply computation. Both sciences have a separate aspect of "supercomputing." One involves throughput and performance, and the other involves availability. By that availability, one does not worry about the possibility of a hetrogenuous system. The concerns of a hetrogenuous system are under computer science and not computational science. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 18:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

== Plea for better intro ==

The intro on this page is horrible.  How about something much more direct:

: '''Computer science''' is the study of computing, especially [[software]] and related topics in [[mathematics]] and [[engineering]].  It is concerned with a wide range of subjects, including for example [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[programming languages]], [[software engineering]], [[computational theory]], ...

and so on from there?  (For what it's worth, although I think of computer science as chiefly a field of mathematics, I feel [[software engineering]] is not yet considered a separate field quite as much as, say, [[chemistry]] vs. [[chemical engineering]].) [[User:Jorend|Jorend]] 04:51, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

:See the interminable discussion above on this page for why the intro looks that way. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 06:16, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

:I like this intro, because it just defines CS at the "study of computers".  It's general enough to not take sides into the debate over whether "scientists" are the only people who do "computer science" --[[User:Jonovision|Jonovision]] 08:56, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

::At my university CS attracts huge amounts of attention, Microsoft even funded a new Computer Lab. If I look at the range of research that takes place, my description is broad enough to take it all into account, other definitions I have seen seem to be very much biased in their emphasis. Keep the introduction general and consign opinion to a seperate section/article. Hope you can agree -- [[User:Tompsci|Tompsci]] 01:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

::: With one of my first computer classes, they taught the difference between "computer-related" and "computer-specific." Surely, the intro would not agree with the professors that state what is "computer-specific." Your intro is not broad enough, as it excluded non-academia. Bill Gates is not a CS graduate, so your lab is if made of funds from a source that is very successful in computer science but which has no academic foundation. Thanks for this information about your lab. Further, your intro is not broad enough because, tompsci, you narrowed it down to academic fields. I've waited for someone to post non-U.S. data to the demographics, but it is not a reason to delete it because only the U.S. data has been posted. Seems kinda like an anti-U.S movement.

::: I remember that the Atari 2600 came out about the same time Microsoft started. The questions that come up often to challenge the definition of computer science need to be answered in the article. The diversity is substantial enough to merit such information. We've started such progress, but it hasn't moved for about a month. Tompsci, perhaps you can make a difference and provide sources instead of an edit war.

Alright, instead of trying to reach consensus on the introduction let us try to reach it for the first sentence, first. I propose ''Computer science is the study of [[computation]], [[information]] and [[complexity]].'' Computation is a no brainer because of the name in English and refers to the theory of computation, analysis of algorithms and programming languages. In most other languages computer science is called something along the lines of ''informatique'' or ''datalogy''. That is where the second field of study comes from. It refers to data structures, databases, .... The University of Leuven (Belgium) defines ''informatica'' ("computer science") as ''de wetenschap die zich bezighoudt met de beheersing van complexiteit'' ("the science which concers itself with the control of complexity") [http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/cs/info_studenten/nieuwe_studenten/informatica/opleiding/]. It refers to computational complexity theory, systems analysis, software engineering... —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 11:56, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

It seems accurate to me.--[[User:Powo|Powo]] 13:12, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:Disagree. IMO This definition excludes many areas of computer science. I propose "computer related science and technology", what are people's objections to this broad definition? -- [[User:Tompsci|Tompsci]] 13:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:: What use is a definition if it is too broad? What areas do you feel are excluded (I can come up with computer graphics)? —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 13:34, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Computer graphics should be included, how is that not computer science? How do we discover the best way to render a scene of objects? -- [[User:Tompsci|Tompsci]] 16:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:::: I did not say it shouldn't be considered computer science, the opposite in fact. It is computer science, but not very well covered by the first sentence. I think it would be impossible to contruct a definition which is both "tight" and covers every aspect of such a diverse field as computer science. This could be remedied, however, by explicitly mentioning computer graphics in the introduction. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 16:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

::The problem, of course, with a definition like "computer related science and technology" is that computers play an increasingly important role in practically all of science and technology, these days.  Whatever form the definition eventually takes, i think the core difference to get across is that computer science is that science which is ''about computers'', and not merely involving, or facilitated by, the use of computers.  In other words, it should be clear that fields like [[bioinformatics]], [[systems theory]], and [[computational physics]] are ''not'' computer science (even though they rely on computers, and even contribute knowledge back to computer science, sometimes).  --[[User:Piet Delport|Piet Delport]] 14:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

::: I agree, however with the reservation that ''about computers'' is meant in the sense of ''computation'' and not physical, tangible computer hardware. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 16:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Why is bioinformatics not computer science? It's concerned with the delelopement of efficient algorithms to perform biological research. I think we should distinguish between the use of computers and applications of CS to other fields. In Theoretical physics you have to design calculations to produce accurate results by avoiding problems involving ''loss of significance''. To do that requires a computer scientist who understands the underlying hardware. -- [[User:Tompsci|Tompsci]] 16:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:::: Bioinformatics is in the grey area. Developing algorithms that can efficiently perform some operation on a string of As, Cs, Gs and Ts would be computer science but applying the algorithm on an enzym would not. If you take these thing too far you get strange result. For instance, I could argue that architecture is physics, because designing a sturdy building requires a lot of mechanics.

:::::Bioinformatics I would argue is a field of CS, however, Genome Sequencing would be Biology/Genetics. Architecture is the design of buildings, structural engineers do all the maths. -- [[User:Tompsci|Tompsci]] 16:44, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:The word "complexity" is ambiguous:  it can generally be understood to mean the study of mathematical ("[[edge of chaos]]") complexity and [[complex system]]s, instead of things like [[computational complexity theory]], "[[Programming Complexity]]", and [[Kolmogorov complexity]]/[[information entropy]]. (I think only the latter ones count as "computer science".)  --[[User:Piet Delport|Piet Delport]] 14:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

::I meant it to be a little ambiguous, so it could refer to computational complexity theory, but it mainly refers to, indeed, finding structure in chaos, which is an important part of the more aplied fields of CS (e.g. software engineering). On of the quote that springs to mind here it ''if a problem is too difficult to solve, add another layer of indirection''. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 15:34, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:::With "finding structure in chaos", i think you mean the kind of chaos/complexity described in the [[Programming Complexity]] article?  However, the words "chaos" and "complexity" have entirely different meanings in the study of [[chaos theory|chaotic]], [[dynamical system|dynamical]], and/or [[complex system|complex]] [[systems theory|systems]]:  in that context, they represent specific mathematical concepts and behaviors that have very little do with computer science or software engineering, as such.  (It's made all the more confusing by the fact that both kinds of complexity do appear in similar (sometimes the same) contexts, even though they connote different things.)  For readers who don't yet have the experience to easily tell the different senses apart, using the term without qualification could easily lead to great confusion, IMHO.  --[[User:Piet Delport|Piet Delport]] 16:25, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

:::: You're right, I shouldn't have used the word chaos so carelessly. The word complexity is meant in the non-mathematical sense here. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 16:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

Transferable voting system, number in order of preference (1 high). Admin votes count double. [[Democracy]] in action! Only people who have previously made non-minor edits to this page are eligble? Agree? Fair? I can't think how else we can agree.

The candidates are (in order of my preference):

# "Computer Science is the academic field of computer related science and technology. It includes fields including but not limited to Algorithms, Graphics, Computer Architecture and Complexity. It does not however encompass the use of computers, as is the case with computing."
# "Computer science, an academic discipline, is the study of computer-related science and technology. Areas that it includes include algorithms, computational theory software engineering and systems analysis. Its concern is with the design and operation of computer systems, not their use, as is the case with computing."
# "Computer science is the study of computation, information and complexity. It includes areas such as the theory of computation, analysis of algorithms, formal methods, concurrency control, databases, computer graphics and systems analysis. Its concern is with the design and operation of computer systems, not their use, as is the case with computing."
# "Computer science is the science of computer systems and related computation. It studies on the management of the complexity in the construction and analysis of its systems."
# "is the study, or science, of computer systems and related computation. It focuses on the management of the complexity in the construction and analysis of its systems."

This is a plea to stop the nonsense with the list of buzzwords as some kind of definition for computer science. As those who studied the field, you should know you have composed a "set" and not a definition. Take the time to describe every buzzword and how it ties into computer science. Just a set does not explain to the reader what computer science is about; there is no pattern. When we have something substantial, we can bring it up into the definition.

I already tried to uses sources form academic pages, and it was considered a "shallow" attempt. How about other publications, instead:
* http://www.brics.dk/RS/94/1/BRICS-RS-94-1.html
:''" This addresses a general audience perhaps, with only a nodding acquaintance with computers. So here's a ``one-line`` definition of Computer Science:''
::''Computer Science is the management of complexity''
::''in the construction and analysis of systems. ''
:''Here ``complex`` is being used in its everyday sense to mean complicated, or huge. Many other areas share the concern of Computer Science in managing complexity. But this issue is particularly acute in the design and control of computing systems."''

When I quoted a university's page, some other users all pointed out in unison how formidable the english was stated. The formidable part is one thing, but the unison of the action is like freshmen who didn't register for class this semester, so they sit around the cafe and act like they are in school with lots of great ideas expressed loudly in complete boredom, as they can't go home and let the family know they aren't registered, yet students these days still have access to the internet at college.

A vague definition that steers the reader in the right direction might be the best we can do.

"We can't expect everybody to have an academic background or even want one." is a good point but the facts are in the open: it is incredible to be hired in the computer industry, or more appropriately, a university/research facility (since we are discussing about CS), without an academic background. CS started with people who were without such formal education because such education for CS did not exist then. Since its formalisation (which coincides with the creation of CS departments, separate from Math departments in universities), this is to be expected. There is no cover-up, in fact feel free to add instances where people contributed to CS with no formal education. I suggest quoting these instances in the current view of the present.

:::::: CS is still knowledge that started nearly a century ago. It is really unknown exactly when it started because obviously the processes were used before computability itself was a focus. People did the work by hand until automation. In order to achieve automation, computability needed to be developed. Computability led into effective methods. Effective methods of that time presently do not describe a computation, but effective methods do describe construction and analysis of computational processes. We do not need formal CS to cut off the non academic root of CS. I am not against academic CS, as the entire academic CS does not view CS the same way. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 21:49, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:'''Comment'''.  As a neutral third party I'd have to say that the original objections (and indeed most of the above dialogue) are somewhat silly semantics quibbles.  I'd be impressed if you could even find ten people from different computer and IT industries that would agree on a definition for "computer science;" much less its history, theory, practice, etc.  One person might say that "computer science" is divergent from computational mathematics, while the next could ardently insist that its roots are in electrical engineering.  The truth of the matter, if there is such a simple thing, probably lies somewhere in the middle or nowhere at all.  I won't be so brash as to support one claim over the other since I've watched both views (and others) be convincingly defended many times over the years.  As it is, the term "computer science" is largely one that is used by academia.  Commercial software development is most often called software engineering or just software development.  I've never heard anybody outside academia refer to themselves as computer scientists or their profession as computer science.  Furthermore, academia does nothing to clarify the matter since one school's definition and method of CS could differ by several orders of magnitude from that of the next. 
:So I've basically verbosely stated what the article already says (though its manner is terse and unconvincing).  I'd tend to agree that the initial generalization the article makes about the nature of computer science is perhaps too bold, but I think it's a waste of time to debate over such a small amount of content.  There should be significant expansion explaining the reasons why CS is a difficult term to strictly define, some of the field's diverse origins (for example, early mathematicians like Von Neumann are often thought of as pioneers of CS, and equally often dismissed as having anything to do with CS), and how all this ties together.  I put the question to you; is a minor edit war over "what CS REALLY IS" and "these five words are unsourced" really worth more of your time and energy than authoring actual improvements and expansions to the text?  Consider.  -- [[User:Uberpenguin|uberpenguin]] 06:46, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

Notice how AAAI makes the statement that the core of computational intelligence is the study of computation. They further state the social science is a major aspect in CS. I agree, and perhaps this is where its seem like I denied anybody because of a social structure point. Many businesses used to get CS grads that could not do any decent social structure. They screamed they needed grads that actually knew english composition, for example. I see you have hinted at the same fact.

::::Academic CS covers science, theory, and software engineering, depending on the individual interests of the student.  For example, I'm in a research master's program; I have friends pursuing master's degrees in software engineering and even "entertainment technology".  Theoretical CS does work its way into actual CS &mdash; this is why Microsoft and Google and Bell all have their own research labs.  Unix was the result of many years of theoretical research into programming languages, compilers, and operating systems, and many of the algorithms it uses have been very carefully studied; it has been used in industry for several decades.  A graduate that has been taught formal algorithm analysis is likely to be able to take your billion-dollar system and make it significantly faster and more reliable, not through simple hacking but through improvements to the basic algorithms.  A friend of mine graduated and went to a small company that makes compilers for embedded systems; last I knew he'd sped up his assigned project by 15% -- not using some "new theory of computation", but using optimizations that have been well-studied in academia but have largely gone unnoticed in industry.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 16:42, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:Stan's content looks good to me &mdash; we shouldn't separate "theoretical computer science" from "computer science", as theoretical CS is just as valid as applied CS, but the current version properly describes theory as a subset of CS as a whole. --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 07:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

::'''Don't merge''': We have had enough headaches with this article alone that justifies a separate article for TCS. I'm sure in a perfect world in a perfect place we have the perfect CS article that includes TCS. Wikipedia is a bit more chaotic than that perfect place. We must go the extra mile to set-up articles so that reader's feel there own inhibitation to edit the opener (for example) to make it sway more towards applied CS, TCS, academic CS, non-academic CS, etc. For now, TCS is pretty distinct from the rest of CS that is will help to have it own article to help cause that self-inhibitation.

:: I started to emphasize the system aspect, but that isn't the point. I described the SDLC as typical phases to manage construction and analysis of systems. These systems generally include computational systems, operational systems, construction systems, hardware systems, software systems, and anything else that is in abstract form within the domain of a computer system. Before I was blocked and the entire article changed, I was about to suggest some changes to the opener (on the talk page) to replace "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_science&oldid=35100413 Computer science, an academic discipline, is a body knowledge about computer hardware, software, computation and theory]" with something like "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_science&diff=35508059&oldid=35478253 Computer science is the study, or science, of computer systems and related computation.]" It wasn't perfect. Perhaps, I should have still put that on the talk page, but I noticed my edits started to change, and I wanted to incorporate the other wikipedians intentions. If you notice, you'll see that I actually broke up the opener as it existed and put part of it into the overview, which was a suggestion by tompsci. Such move was reported by R.Koot as a revert. After I had been blocked, I discussed it with the admin that blocked me. It was noted that I was unblocked early, but I didn't edit the page for couple of days. I started on the talk page. Immediately, we saw the stones thrown again. The overview dissapeared.

The text of the overview section:
:The computer system performs automated tasks and executes computational systems. Modern computer systems have an [[operating system]], which contains a set of software-based [[algorithm]]s that controls its hardware system.

:[[Software]] involves a study of [[computer language]]s and [[programming paradigm]]s, which further involves [[mathematical practice]]s and [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].

:[[Hardware]] involves the study of [[computer architecture]] and its [[peripheral]]s. Hardware systems may consist only of a set of a direct [[cybernetic]] interfaces to attached physical devices, or it may consist of virtual hardware devices, known as the hardware abstraction layer. Virtual hardware is not physical, so it is usually in the form of software.

:Computer science uses experimentation and investigation to initiate system development. A typical life cycle of system development is delineated into a sequence of phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, maintenance, and back to investigation or experimentation (if needed). Besides system development, the act of hardware and software construction is an engineerial aspect, related to [[computer engineering]] and [[information technology]]. Computer science, on the other hand, goes deeper into computability.

* '''Rewrite.''' There should be an overview section, but I do not find the overview above adequate. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 22:28, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

*'''Rewrite.''' I have serious problems with the inclusion of this content, especially as an overview of CS in general.  The first and third paragraphs, I think, belong in [[computer system]].  The second and fourth paragraphs describe [[computer programming]] and [[software engineering]] in particular rather than computer science in general, and (in keeping with our current avoidance of field-specific content) belong in those articles; if we expand and restore "fields" to incorporate significant summaries they could be a good part of the summaries for those articles, though.

I was, in fact, the one who most recently deleted that content.  If we are going to provide field-specific content we need to do so without placing undue emphasis on any particular set of fields, which means:
*Including content from all branches of CS (or as many as we can), rather than a restricted subset.  Until this can be accomplished, that section should be marked with {{tl|section-stub}}.
*Treating lengthy summaries of fields as such, rather than as a brief overview of CS in general.
*Avoiding in-depth summaries of topics that are related to CS but not included in the study or practice of CS itself.  You'll notice the [[Astronomy]] article doesn't include in-depth content on [[telescope]]s, though it does refer to several ways in which astronomers use telescopes.  Similarly, we need not avoid the fact that computer scientists use computer systems, but we do need to avoid discussing computer systems outside that context.

:An interesting array of sources, to be sure; however, most of them strongly relate to the study of computation, and most don't actually provide a definition &mdash; just a description.
*The first discusses CS from 1936-1969 (please read context, not just select fragments).  The article goes on to describe '''software engineering''' and '''software science''', but doesn't ever define modern CS except to say that it is a mathematical activity -- not a definition so much as a description.
*The second refers to computability theory (the narrow field), not computer science.
*The quote from Microsoft Research says, essentially, that some schools are teaching only programming and not the more diverse aspects of computer science.
*Your fourth source discusses theoretical CS and the fact that it is strongly tied to computation.  It ''does not'' say anything about whether applied CS has anything to do with computation &mdash; absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
*The fifth source is from cprogramming.com (a decidedly POV source to begin with), but it's surprisingly non-POV.  It does not attempt to provide any formal definition (the tone of the article is promotional rather than informational), but even if it did, that article emphasizes computability.  From the same source: "Ever since Turing formulated this extraordinary concept, Computer Science has been dedicated to answering one question: 'Can we compute this?'"
*The sixth source (IU SE) never actually says what CS is, just that CS is the means through which one learns software development.  No one is claiming that software development is not included in CS; my claim is that CS is more than ''just'' software development.  See the second paragraph of the section labeled "theory and practice" &mdash; IU SE is precisely one of these schools.
*The seventh source (Philip Greenspun) never attempts to define CS; he simply laments the fact that not all CS graduates are software engineers.  This tells me that a definition of CS that restricts itself to software engineering is inappropriate; but nothing in the current definition precludes software engineering from being valid CS.
*Webopedia is an ad farm for online classes, and targetted mainly at IT workers.  Not a reliable source, as far as I'm concerned.
*The BU definition reads as though it were written by a focus group.  It's way too big for a normal-person's encyclopedia, but thankfully the question at the end gives us clarity: "computational processes"
*The Haverford definition talks about algorithms, which are inherently computational, and data structures, which are needed to implement algorithms.  It follows up with a series of three questions, one discussing algorithms and one discussing computation.
*The one-line BRICS summary is interesting, but the rest of the article is about semantics ''of computation'', algorithms, and mathematical logic.  The [[Curry-Howard isomorphism]] tells us that logic and computation are intimately related; so we're left with computation, algorithms for performing computations, and, well, computation. - bmills

::I've read your comments, and I disagree with your intrepretation. This word "computation" seems to behold you and others. It is a significant words that describes the means of only one of the products, or one end result, of CS.

The word to emphasis is "computational processes", which in no way is a subset of a "computation" itself. For example, we do math by hand, the hand movement, the written structure, the language system, the optical recognition, are all part of the process, but they are not part of a "computation." If the process is meant to effect a computation, it is then a "computational process."

The common threads among the articles, taken in full context, are computation and computability, with other things that relate to it (especially programming).  So it makes sense to have computation in the very first sentence, and then have some additional sentences explaining the many ways that CS approaches computation &mdash as a thing to be studied (computability & algorithms), a thing to be implemented (programming), or a means to some other end (graphics, AI, applications, etc.).  And that's exactly what we've got now.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 05:07, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:: That is your POV. That is a few other's POV. It is not a neutral point of view. Do you program a computer and expect it to complete that program for you? That is what you suggested above. That we juse use the word "computation" and expect the rest to be automatically handled. If we just use computation, we could replace it with a more vivid definition: "CS is the study of finding a solution to a problem from given inputs by means of an algorithm." Really, that is icing on the cake -- cream of the crop -- point of view. There are those that have obviously swept computability under the rug.

:: If we used "CS is the study of computational processes" rather than just "computation," we would be at least one word closer to an agreement. However, that itsn't enough. It doesn't cover, for example, maintenance, security, or computability. Even "the study of computation" doesn't cover maintenance, security, or computability.

::: The implication of the first paragraph in the above reply is that other people's POV are not NPOV while yours, in your own words, are "the icing on the cake -- cream of the crop -- point of view". I am unable to see how neutral that POV is.

::: Let's put this in perspective. Let's assume there is a term "mathematical science". It's current definition is calculation. A proposition is for it to be a study of calculational processes. Both terms are well-defined, with the former relating to the base form of the core of "mathematical science" while the latter is the expanded version. Is there a need then to replace all versions of the former with the latter when they are nearly interchangeable?

:::You don't have to have a degree is CS to participate in CS, especially considering that at the time Bill Gates was in school there weren't many CS programs.

That sentence would work great in an article about academic fields of computer science, but not in one that tries to describe computer science itself. If you make the article list all these sub-fields, does the reader then have to attend every sub-field to finally understand what computer science is? Or, do you suggest, by POV, the reader only attend a select set of sub-fields so they will have the exact same view on computer science? Back-up, lets get down to earth and describe computer science without any relation to sub-fields!

:::::The fact that not all computer scientists perform all the same tasks is not a POV; it is a fact.  Even real-world programmers have specializations &mdash; you don't see professional compiler writers hand-optimizing OpenGL games.  The academic fields of computer science ''are a part of computer science'', whether you like it or not; moreover, academic fields actually do map onto some real-world careers (others have careers that are only available in the context of research labs, like Bell Labs or Google Labs, or in academia).  OS specialists write operating systems, robotics specialists program robots, and networking specialists write (and/or improve) networking protocols.  Honestly, I wasn't particularly happy with the article as a list of sub-fields and I appreciate your edit moving them to another location.  I think it really helps focus the article, rather than distracting the reader with a particular sub-field (be it programming, operating systems, or my personal favorite &mdash; type theory) that can be better understood by reading another article anyway.

'''Change''': I have just spent another few hours on research over terminology of the word "computation." Given we could limit its definition and assume it includes some things and excludes others so that a propositional out of "computer science is the study of computation" is true, yet how does the reader know all of this? I just had to read a few hours worth of texts just to confirm my previous notion that "computation" is to broad to make a specific definition as "computer science is the study of computation" as true for a general audience such as one that reads wikipedia. Is this to hard to understand? Of course computer scientist know what they do, but there are many that seem to have a hard time to come back down to earth and explain things in simple terms. This is really my pressure on this article. I've tried several ways to expand that definition, but I have been ridiculed, blocked, thrown stones at (in gesture), and disgraced all just because I feel I have contributed something towards where '''this page might actually teach something''' rather than to state the obvious for an audience of only computer scientists. Is this hard to understand? With all those childish gestures made at me, god forbid if one here actually starts to edit the computer science article on the simple english wikipedia!!! I mean, I might be tough enough to take some of those thrown stones and throw them back, but over there, without me and with some other wikipedians here over there, in likewise would be mass murder. The best writers of the article are non computer-scientist! Not that I suggest censorship, but they will find reputable and verifiable sources instead of personal expertise or POV in order to create an article and back it up with sources. The need for sources may seem like peer presure, but it needs to be done. I've seen it done on many other articles, but it really lacks here.

If I was a newbie to CS, and I read the article I would see that it says "CS is the study of computation." Of course to further understand what is CS, one has to understand what is a computation. Then as a newbiew, I click on the link for computation and I get "a computation is evolution over time of a computer." I ask, is it then true that "CS is evolution over time of a computer?" As a newbie reader I would assume it is true since it was written that way by those who have verified their reputable sources. I further read in the article that "CS has nothing do to about computer..." and the telescope comparision and so-on. As a newbie that has just read that, I am so confused. It starts as to say that "CS is the evolution over time of a computer," but it also states it has nothing to do about computers, so "CS is the evolution over time of brillance!" Yes; I really '''do''' <s>not</s> follow that logical substitution.

We could go '''update''' the [[computation]] article, and I highly suggest that we do. Computation, however, is still to general of a word to use where stated as "CS is the study of computation." In coverse, does this mean that any study of computation is considered computer science? I've spent a few hours and I have found the answer: no. There are actually different means to the word computation. I've found articles, for example [http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~celiasmi/Papers/dynamics.mm.html Computation and Dynamical Models of Mind], that shows evidence that scientist have not found a common truth to what properly delineates the computational from the noncomputational. It seems that we have tried to get into such debate, but it can't seem to stay focused. Obviously, if scientist can't do it than what expectation is there for us to figure it out here. For us to really make that claim (or thesis) is original research, and that, consequently, is a no-no. It is also obvious that the word computation is pivotal on means, but those that use the words don't always pivot with the same means, so it is somewhat religious in usage. Those that follow a particular path know which way to pivot. We can't, however, expect anybody to believe or accept the means of computaton as intended as written or expect a particular path to be taken. This is how loopholes are in good-faith unintentionally made. In essence, I can see the '''brillance''' of the light shine through the holes in the statement: "CS is the study of computation". What specific type of computation does one study in computer science that would stay true to say any study of x is considered computer science? What paradigm is needed to be laid out in front of the reader that shows any study of x is considered computer science? If x is not computation, what is it?  &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 17:13, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

: Dzonatas. This is touching: you start to discover what science and philosophy of science is about! This naivness of yours explains your difficulty to understand the POV of scientists. You say that scientists (such as us...) dont agree on the ontology (i.e. the meaning behind the concept) we put in the term ''computation'', and that we can therefore not define CS as the study of computations. However, let me tell you that my feeling, as a scientist (and even more so as a computer scientist) is that scientists all agree that computer science studies computations, even if the meaning of a computation is not so clear. Now check this out (and then go and study some philosophy of science, and let this article become something usefull AND litterate): scientists and philosophers agree that science is the study of the natural world, even when the ontology we put on ''natural world'' is vague, not clearly defined or impossible to define completely. So is the case with the view of CS as the study of computations! Thats how science is, an astonishingly difficult to define activity... You say the reader will be puzzled when he reads this article? Well if this puzzleness lets him get out of the all too common belief that CS is just about computers (i.e. PC's...), if this lets the reader envisaged that CS is a science with "just as much on its plate as physics, mathematics, etc...", when he previously thought CS was just about making computers work: GOOD! Its the way to let CS become known as a true, deep and noble science to the public. Never again a cocktail talk such as:

:CS as the "study of computation" is well-sourced (see my previous comment), though it's true that the [[computation]] article as currently formulated is terrible.  Worse than a newbie coming to wikipedia and not immediately understanding the first line of the article would be a newbie coming to wikipedia and getting the impression that CS is ''just'' about writing code and building computers, or ''just'' about algorithms and operating systems, etc.  There's a reason CS enrollment is on the decline, and a lot of people (myself included) think that a lot of the reason for that is that potential students don't think there's anything scientifically interesting to do in CS.  It drives me crazy when I tell friends or relatives that I'm a computer scientist only to have them ask, "What do you think of Bill Gates?" or "Can you make my printer work?"

:While "computation" may be vague, it is that very vagueness that allows the incredible diversity within the field of computer science &mdash; the freeness of "computation" is what allows type theorists and programmers and cryptographers to all be computer scientists.  How do we resolve whether a computation-related field is CS or not?  Simple.  We ask its practitioners if they consider themselves computer scientists.

:Simple definitions have to be succinct enough to be read and understood; a simple definition with a more in-depth explanation is preferable to a complex definition that is too precise to encompass everything that computer scientists do.  The hypothetical newbie may not immediately understand what is meant by "the study of computation", but that's why the article is more than just one sentence.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 21:51, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

'''Ultimatum'''. Let's settle this definition. Dzonatas, there is an offered solution by bmills that is a better reflection of mine. If you choose not to accept it, I cannot see how else your input can be accepted when it has been quite consistently been opposed by others. A rejection of the proposal will cause the article to '''keep''' the current definition, in which only you have an opposition.

:Another note about computation: it is not well-defined. Even bmills said it is vague. This use of computation is a problem. I am not against to use the word in the definition, but it needs appropriate well-defined limits. Sure, "the study of computation" can be found in sources, but these are absurd. Likewise, I've seen history articles try to use well published books on particular events. The events themselves are bogus. The books are absurd. However, wikipedians still try to use them a credible sources because they are verifiable existance of its published text. This is what I don't want to see happen to the definition of CS that could easily be stated otherwise. I can find some pretty silly definitions. To exclude any other source that challenges or try to define CS except only as "the study of computation" is not [[NPOV]].

With that argument, the physics of (b) is not a part of the computation in (a), and a portion of (a) and (b) overlap inside and outside of CS.

Wikipedia is concerned with the neutral view point, and that is the best one so far. I'm not conviced about "CS is the study of computation," but I didn't say it was wrong.

Clarkson includes hardware study as an "IT option"; the UCSC program is through their engineering school, and their curriculum separates the requirements into "computer science" (which doesn't have any hardware courses) and "computer engineering" (which does).

This is an example of a [[forward-looking statement]]: "a computer system (at its most general) is a system for performing computations". Modern computer systems have computations, but they do not perform computations. It may be possible in theory someday like how calculus has i. Today, AI with neural networks that learn and grow intelligently are pretty close to "performing computations." Perhaps, that is why CI has a central study of computation - to find models of computation that work well for neural networks and that can further self interconnect their self-grown models. Computer systems execute computational systems. We simply do not say CS is the study of computation like we do not say math is the study of i. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 22:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

1st: I noticed they do not offer a BS in Computer Science but only a BA without a complementary degree (or no such options were found at first look). This also emphasizes that there is no engineerial study at that college beyond its select fundamentals. (There is a referal to another college.) Some quotes: "Computer scientists learn to program computers..." and "When we study operating systems or networks, we emphasize the internals, not how they should be configured for use."

2nd: "Computer Science is not really a "science of computers" at all." We already know this. "This is the real subject matter of Computer Science: computation, and what can or cannot be done computatively." Computation is subject to Computer Science. Yes; indeed.

3rd: "Computer science is not the science of the computer " - we said that also - "- it is the science of problem-solving using a computer. If you are a computer science major, you will see this in many forms – the study of algorithms, of machine hardware, of programming languages, operating systems, database design, and more. And the career opportunities are equally varied – software engineer, database manager, network administrator, project manager, and many others. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, gives the following information in its summary of occupations..." This included: "The study of" "machine hardware." No ka oi! Mahalo!

4th: "Computer science education explains how computers work from the atoms up to the Internet; but that is not all. It teaches many other things." Awesome. This one was listed on the springboard of AAAI.

5th: "Computer science includes the analysis, design, development and deployment of systems..." Good. "Although students majoring in computer science are introduced to the elements of electronic circuits and computer hardware, the in-depth study of such systems is provided by the School of Engineering’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering." Awesome.

6th: "To quote the Association for Computing Machinery, "Computer Science is not simply concerned with the design of computing devices..."..." Like the 2nd, computation is arguably a device and is subject to Computer Science.

7th: "Computer science is not about the study of computers, nor is it the study of programming." (The 1st says "Computer scientists learn to program computers...".) This also states "Programming is a tool...". "Computer science is mainly about the study of algorithms, which includes their mathematical properties, their hardware realizations, their linguistic realizations, and their applications." This does one does not state "CS is the study computation," but it uses "algorithms" instead of "computation." This further states: "An algorithm is a well-ordered collection of unambiguous and effectively computable operations that, when executed, produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time. You build algorithms from several kinds of operations." This sheds a little light on why some distinct individual here put "CS is the study of algoritms" rather than "the study of computation." A "computation" is not an "effectively computable operation" in its most general terms.

8th: "A primary aim of the day was to put across the message that computer science is not all about amassing obscure technical knowledge in IT, but more about creative thinking and analytical problem solving." "An important issue for us", said one of the organisers, "is to let the local community know that an education in computer science is so much more than how the popular press normally portrays it."" Perhaps, there is an art to this science - "creative thinking."

From these open sources, "Computer science is the study, or science, of algoritms and computer systems." Q.E.D. I resume my studies. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 22:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

:There are those that believe computation is universal and the universe is everything. That kind of computation has not been proven, but it is what they believe. They believe that given a long enough tape, a Turing machine could do computation of every aspect of life and the universe, which include functionally cognitive embodiments and the conscious beyond. It's like a religuous belief. What they really have is faith in word computation. They believe the conscious can be physically simulated. Physics has even stated that conscious is a phenomenon. CS is not a faith system that tries to make people believe that such phenomenon can be computationally modelled. It is a scientific system based on facts, and when the time comes that conscious itself is factually modelled by computation is when I can agree that "CS is the study of computation." &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]]

:The fact that computation is not well-defined means it is not suited for a scientific definition of CS. I use "scientific" to denote that CS is based on a system of science, not that the formulation of the definition is a scientific result. The word computation alone does not justify CS's system of science. It may be true the within CS one studies computation, but that does not define CS. Even Alan Turing noted that not everything can be done by a Turing machine. This is where he limited the thesis to "purely mechanical." To suggest that definition of CS is "the study of computation" alone is academic dishonesty based on these facts.

However you have failed to do so and sought to contravene the current situation at least twice.

It contrasts four different influential definitions and gives them as secondary sources.
:# Computer science is the study of phenomena related to computers, Newell, Perlis and Simon, 1967
:# Computer science is the study of algorithms, Knuth, 1968 
:# Computer science is the study of information structures, Wegner, 1968
:# Computer science is the study and management of complexity, Dijkstra, 1969.
* This publishment shows how these break down into empirical (1), mathematical (2,3), and engineerial (4) aspects of computer science. These are the aspects, based on reputable and verifiable sources, I would like to see included in the definition for this article. As we can see by the definition on the article, "study of information and computation," compared to the the definitions above, the definition on the article only covers the mathematical aspects of computer science.
* From much of the novel discussion, I believe there is a concern to not emphasize the the engineerial aspects. That is fine, but it is still obviously knowledge within CS and should not be excluded. When I chatted here with a few, I get the notion they think POV is that, engineerial. However, it is not. I emphasize that policy is about neutrality. Wikipedia is about verifibility, not truth. A few here insist that the definition covers everything, freely, but they have shown no sources to back up that claim, not that they haven't provided sources.
* Each of these aspects deserve equal mention. CS has never mutated from one set of knowledge to another. As the publishment has stated above, it has been dominated by different subjects and aspects at different times, which kinda reflects what has happened to this article.
* The other thing to point out is the use of "study". Notice on [[biology]] how it refers to the study or science. The study emphasizes a academic viewpoint. CS is one of those sciences that does not have to be studied in academia. It took at least 30 years for the first academic department related to computer science to even begin. There is no need to exclude its science that doesn't specifically fall under academia.
* I'm open on a one-liner as long as it covers the aspects noted above. The empirical side of the science definitly needs attention. I suggest: "CS is the study of computation, algorithms, and information structures and the management of complexity in the phenomena related to computers." &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 01:33, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

* There are several good reasons for this. First, the words science is already contained in the word omputer science, no need to mention it twice in  a sentence.

Also note that algorithms would already be covered by computation and I have doubts "information structures" is well-defined enough.

Please everyone calm down.

Here is (one of) Dz's proposed sentence(s):

:'''Computer science''' is the study, or science, of [[algorithms|algorithmic]]{{ref|def-algorithms}} processes, [[information]]al{{ref|def-information}} structures, models of [[computation]]{{ref|def-computation}}, and [[computer systems]]{{ref|def-compsys}}.

Here, for comparison, is the other one:

:Computer science is the study of information and computation.

I am going to propose a compromise sentence:

:Computer science is the study of [[algorithms|algorithms]]{{ref|def-algorithms}}, [[computation]]{{ref|def-computation}}, [[information]]{{ref|def-information}} structures, and [[computer systems]]{{ref|def-compsys}}.

Does anybody object to this sentence? If so, please propose a modified version of this sentence? My feeling is that the definition should be rather inclusive, so I've included pretty much everything in both. We also, I note have an article discussing the definition of CS itself, so we don't have to get this perfect. [[User:Sdedeo|Sdedeo]] <small>([[User:Sdedeo/advice|tips]])</small> 06:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

:I prefer the previous, shorter and more to-the-point definition, possibly with one modification:  
::''Computer science is the study of information processing and computation.''
::(Reasoning for not saying (just) "information":  in all the instances i can think of (algorithms, data structures, information theory, coding theory, data compression...), CS studies what you can ''do'' with information, and ''how'';  in other words, the focus is on the dynamic processes being applied to information, not on the information itself.  Studying information, without processing, sounds more like something from [[semiotics]] or [[semantics]] than computer science.  Maybe it's just me, though.)
:Criticisms of the proposed compromise:
:*"algorithms" is arguably subsumed by "computation".
:*What is "informational structures" supposed to mean?  If it means "data structures", then, like "algorithms", it probably doesn't belong here.  (The definition should try to capture the essense of computer science, not give a laundry list of sub-disciplines.)
:*I'm not sure what sense "computer systems" is meant in, but the one that seems obvious (and that the linked article describes) is "hardware/software plaftorm", such as the common PC, the study of which falls under computer engineering rather than computer science.

: I agree with Piet here. Drop the objectionable parts (algorithms, structures and computer systems) and you end up with the current defintion. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 13:17, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

OK, I am now going to update the sentence in response to the discussion. Piet, thank you. Ruud, you are not being helpful; the current sentence is not going to survive intact, that is the nature of compromise.

I agree that algorithms fall under the more general "computation", so kill it. I also agree with Piet that "information structures" is odd; however, I don't see any value to saying "information processing" after saying the ultra general "computation", so kill that too. Finally, re: "computer systems", I read the section in the article "Relationship with software engineering", which makes the claim that it is POV to exclude (or indeed include) computer engineering from computer science. This fits with my own experience with computer scientists, who are loath to restrict the definition to the "theory" end. So:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of [[computation]]{{ref|def-computation}} and, under more liberal definitions, [[computer systems]]{{ref|def-compsys}} as well.

Comments? Dz, is this OK? Piet, Ruud, Evanx? [[User:Sdedeo|Sdedeo]] <small>([[User:Sdedeo/advice|tips]])</small> 16:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

:I think it's important to distinguish here between [[software engineering]] and [[computer engineering]]. The former deals pretty much exclusively with the design of software, which is why there's dispute about whether or not it is part of computer science. The latter deals with both hardware and software - in other words, [[computer systems]] - and I don't think I've ever heard anyone claim that it should be included under the heading of "computer science". Every "computer engineering" degree program I've ever heard of has either grown out of an [[electrical engineering]] department, or been created by merging EE and CS departments (hardware+software). Software engineering, on the other hand, is less clear cut. Many computer science departments claim to teach software engineering, and the degree programs for software engineering that exist have had their roots in CS, EE, or a collaboration between the two, depending on the school. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 17:47, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

: Contrary to popular belief, computer scientists do not study computer systems, computer engineers do. It would be silly to deny that there isn't a significant overlap in educational programs offered at universities and colleges, but this should be threated later in the article. Stating it in the first sentence is misleading and would only help to spread common myths. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 18:15, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

::You have strong beliefs about what CS is. However, numerous sources, and numerous other parts of the article contributed by a number of people, discuss that CS ''can'', for some people, include computer systems.

We should be careful here to avoid [[WP:NOR|original research]]. In particular, everybody involved in this article knows a least a little (me) and probably quite a lot (many others) about CS life. But we have to stick in this article to what is substantiated elsewhere. "Software engineering" I think it's established is sometimes separate from, and sometimes a subset of, CS, depending on who's talking, and we need to respect that. Now, I do think it's clear that designing a new kind of read head on a hard drive is EE not CS, but I think we don't imply that in the latest sentence above? [[User:Sdedeo|Sdedeo]] <small>([[User:Sdedeo/advice|tips]])</small> 17:55, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

: Sorry for being so "unhelpful" but we've worked pretty hard on the definition as it stands, and everybody agrees with it except for Dzonatas. I do not believe compromise is necessary per se, unless someone comes up with more convincing arguments. As can be seen on the talk page and the archives the current definition is definitly not original research and I would go as far as saying that is the definition used most widely. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 18:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

==medcabal 2==

OK, we have two compromise sentences so far; let's not let them proliferate so as to be able to keep track.

One that I have suggested is:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of [[computation]]{{ref|def-computation}} and, under more liberal definitions, [[computer systems]]{{ref|def-compsys}} as well.

One that Allan and Bmills have proposed collaboratively is:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of the properties and implementation of computation.

Let's pause here for a moment. Since the original conflict arose against Dz, Dz it would be helpful to hear from you if you could accept either of these two sentences. Similarly, I'd like to hear from the other three parties: R.Koot/Ruud, Evanx and powo. Please, let us know briefly if either of these two sentences is OK; if not, can you propose a minimal modification of one or the other that you would be happy with?

::: Works for me. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 18:59, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

About the new compromises, which I didn't see before my previous post: they do work in the right direction. My suggestion from those is a combination of the two:

::"Computer science is the study of the implementation of computation and phenomena related to computers." [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 18:49, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

-----

OK, so we're getting closer. My feeling is that Dz's sentence has one major problem: it is too vague at the end ("phenomena related to computers" could be what happens when you drop a computer on your foot.) We should be inclusive in the wording, of course.

So I'm going to combine the Ruud/Allan/Bmills evolved sentence with Dz's. Here is the next draft:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of computation, as well as its implementations and applications.

"implementations and applications" seems to me to be the phenomena that Dz wants to talk about. Meanwhile, I've cut the word "information" -- I don't know what the "implementation and applications" of information is, and as others have remarked (I think it was Bmills?), "information" can be a bit too broad: CS is about how information is organized and manipulated (a subset of "computation".)

Let go another round: Dz, Ruud, Allan, Bmills, please let me know if you can live with this version. If not, please provide a minimal modification of it that would satisfy you. [[User:Sdedeo|Sdedeo]] <small>([[User:Sdedeo/advice|tips]])</small> 19:28, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

:*'''Not yet''' - I stand by my point that information should be included. In most non-english languages computer science is called informat- or data-. Information is an integral part of computer science, wheter we are talking about database, information theory, data structures or Kolmogorov complexity. I see the problem with the sentency not being entierly correct, but but solution should be a rephrasing, not removing one of the critical keywords. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 19:43, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

OK. Dz, the problem with "phenomena related to computers" is that it really is incredibly vague, even humorously so; computation is vague, but in a good way. Let me put it another way: what words would you add to "implementation" and "application" to get at what you mean by phenomena (i.e., so we don't include the phenomenon of dropping your computer on your foot.) Ruud, I see what you are saying. However, do remember that, e.g., librarians often describe themselves as doing "information science"; so information itself is also rather vague.

Let's try again.

:'''Computer science''' is the study of computation and information processing, as well as its implementations and applications.

Again, let me know if you can support, and if not, how you would minimally modify. My inclusion of "information" is suboptimal, so suggestions that avoid inadvertantly including, e.g., library science, would be welcome.

This discussion is moving forward but the definition is facing so much stress in trying to appeal to all parties when the alternative is to change the mindset, that which the terms "information" and "computation" are all-inclusive, rather than exclusive.

"information" is a superset of "abstract properties of information". We use that mouthful to make sure the article doesn't include "the study of how to organize information for library users" or "the study of how information is communicated to people via symbols" in the def of CS.

Dz, I know you want either "computer systems" or "phenomena related to computers"; you are probably not going to get either of those. Please suggest an addition to the words "implementation" and "applications" that broadens the sentence sufficiently.

Rudd, "properties" to "theory" is fine with me.

As for "accurate" versus "a mouthful", I think we will have to settle. We are trying to resolve a dispute between users because people claim one or another sentence is inaccurate. I am not going to spend time trying to polish prose -- all I am here to do is try to get a compromise sentence that satisfies the various "five pillars" of wikipedia, none of which include prosodic beauty.

[[User:Sdedeo|Sdedeo]], It seems unfair because you put the burden on me instead to divide it equally. By your own vote, you dropped my suggestion twice but moved forward with other newer suggestions. I have gone way out of my way for months to find different sources that support different views. I have included those sources here. Now, you want me to further include more sources to suggest some other term than what is already found by the sources? I do not see the other contributions backed up by sources with any reason (expect there own) to exclude "computer systems" or "phenomena related to computers." I've made the case for the dominent mathematical paradigm here. That is obviously wanted terms of "information" and "computation." Why do we even need them both? I even googled "computer science is the study of information and computation": result, 55 hits. A careful study reveals most of those are redundant links, which leaves only 13 hits of sites that existed at some time. Remove sites that don't exist anymore, and we're left with only 10 hits. Remove sites that are only directory lists, and we're left with 5 hits all from a few European universities. Obviously, not the view of the rest of the world. From this, I don't see how a slight modification to the sentence is fair, either.

Lets back-up a bit.

:'''Computer science''' is the study of computer systems, the abstract properties of [[information]] and the theory, implementation and applications of computation. 

* Is there another way to say "computation" or "information"? &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 22:02, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

* Another suggestion: I looked at a few other mediations, and I don't see this scheme of a quick vote in the solution. Perhaps, it is not the solution here either. Consider it is quick, the verifiable facts are really questionable. It is more like a game... and insane. When I saw the "I don't have time for to read this," I highly doubted it would be fair even if it included something I lean towards.

'''Suggestion''' - The sticking point here seems to be over "computer systems". How about the phrase "'''computing''' systems", as an alternative to "computer systems". --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 22:34, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

:'''Computer science''' is the study of the abstract properties of [[information]] and the theory, implementation and applications of computation.

* '''Support''': I would agree with the above sentence. If it makes Dz happy, I would also agree with the following sentence:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of the abstract properties of computer systems, [[information]] and the theory, implementation and applications of computation.

: This last sentence would be fine for me because a computer system can be ''any physical sytsem'' in which a computation occures. Thus, the ''study of computer systems'' and the ''study of computation'' is alsmost similar. --[[User:Powo|Powo]] 22:44, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

::Computations can exist outside of computer systems (just look at [[lambda calculus]], which describes computations independently of any "computer system"); as such, "computer system" is not an appropriate substitution for "computation".  However, this last proposal is fairly good; or what about a (IMO less camel-ish) revision along the lines of my earlier proposal:

::"'''Computer science''' is the study of the theoretical foundations of [[information]] and [[computation]] and their implementation and application in [[computer system]]s."

::This includes "information" (R.Koot), "computation" (me), and "computer system" (Dz), and explicitly includes theory, implementation, and even applications.  I would also claim that it could not be easily construed to include library science.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 23:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

::: I like it. And will support it if [[User:Sdedeo|Sdedeo]] puts it to vote. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 00:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

A few meta notes:

* Wikipedia is not a democracy; i.e., votes (except in rare cases) are never binding. We basically have to keep working until everyone is happy (or gets banned, whichever comes first.) This is IMO a very good thing. So instead of taking a vote, it's more a question of "does anyone object".

* Dz, I'm sorry if you were annoyed that I wrote "I don't have time to read this." IMO, 90% of the proposed sentences on this page are absolutely fine. I am not a CS expert, but neither am I a newcomer to either CS or the tricky question of defining a discipline. The main thing we are doing here is trying to get everyone to agree on one (any one!) of many many valid sentences. So it's more a question of sketching out the very rough outlines; my job is definitely not to arbitrate between competing essays.

* Why am I doing this? My feeling is that this argument has been wasting everybody's time, and my main goal here is to get you guys to agree to an opening sentence so you can do something far more useful: improve the rest of the article. So much effort has been wasted on this single sentence at the expense of time that could have gone into expanding and sourcing the article as a whole.

==medcabal 4==

OK, I'm back. It seems that people have solved problems for themselves, which is great.

As far as I can tell, the following:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of the theoretical foundations of [[information]] and [[computation]] and their implementation and application in [[computer system]]s.

has the support of Powo, Allen and bmills; it has Dz's desired "computer systems", and I think it might get Ruud's.

Just as a side note, figuring out the truth by allowing google to "vote" on various sentences is problematic: [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=safari&rls=en&q=%22wikipedia+is+great%22&btnG=Search] [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=safari&rls=en&q=%22wikipedia+sucks%22&btnG=Search]. On the other hand, I may have been too quick to drop that magical phrase "computer systems" as lacking support, which has annoyed Dz; I'm sorry about that.

OK, so what I'm going to do at this point is wait for five hours or so. If anybody has ''serious'' objections to this sentence, other than its "camel" nature which I think is unavoidable, please pipe up now with a modified version of this sentence in this section.

:* '''Support''' - As I said, I'm happy with this one too. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 00:47, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
:* '''Weak support'''. Minor nitpicks: The defintion would be just as true without the ''in computer systems'' part and even looses some generality because of it (e.g. implementation of computation would no longer refer to the design of programming languages). Also the rest of the introdution would explicitly need to mention that computer science does not deal with the design, implentation and application of computer systems ''themselves''. I find this defintion acceptable (although on the edge of) but do not expect me to defend it, or name some computer scientists who study the implementation of computation ''in computer systems''. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 01:00, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Would "computing systems" be more palatable? It has (to me at least) a broader interpretation than "computer systems", and could be considered to include things like programming languages. Still retains the flavour of what I ''think'' Dz is trying to ensure gets included. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 01:46, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:::: I don't think this would really change the meaning of the sentence for most people, so if we are going with it, I'd prefer simply "computer systems". —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 02:19, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

::::: Fair enough. Just trying to find something that might be more agreeable. I'd prefer to have "in computer systems" removed altogether, but I don't think we're going to get that. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 03:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:* '''Support''' bmills' suggestion. "Theoretical foundations" combined with "in computer systems" in that sentences does not exclude the empirical paradigm, which is my main concern. It is a way for the different paradigms to coexist. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]]

:* '''Weak support'''. I would prefer that "in computer systems" be removed as suggested by  Ruud, for the same reasons. But I am very pleased with the redefinition using "theoretical foundations". -- [[User:Evanx|<sup><b><font color="brown">Evanx</font></b></sup>]] 02:49, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:*'''Support''' (obviously &mdash; I wrote it).  While the application of information and computation aren't restricted to computer systems, exotic applications could (at this point) be considered mainly theoretical, in which case they're still included (win!).  For the record, Ruud, my research focus is in the design of programming languages, and I consider that to be included under "theoretical foundations".  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 05:01, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

OK, so we have no objections (though definitely we can acknowledge that not everyone is perfectly happy with this; I am, because it means you can all get on to more important things.) I am going to go with it (we haven't heard from Powo, but I am going to assume he is good to go, it's been more than a few hours.) What I am going to do is put this in, archive a big chunk of this discussion, and leave some final remarks.

== medcabel: computation vs. software ==

* We can work with the mediator's suggested compromise: "Computer science is the study of [[algorithms|algorithms]]{{ref|def-algorithms}}, [[computation]]{{ref|def-computation}}, [[information]]{{ref|def-information}} structures, and [[computer systems]]{{ref|def-compsys}}." There is doubt about its perfection as with the definition that is on the article. This kind of doubt, nevertheless, is really the fact that there is no perfect definition. Several authors have studied and written directly about the diversity of computer science and why it has happened; hence, it is not some pseudoscience within this group here why we have different viewpoints. Even as stated in the abstract of the publishment ''[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807694 Research paradigms in computer science]'', "''... the diversity of research paradigms in computer science may be responsible both for our difficulties in deciding how computer scientists should be trained and for divergences of opinion concerning the nature of computer science research.''"
* One consideration may be not to suggest what computer is but to start off with the a definition of what it is not. For example, a definition that starts as "Computer science is not just about computers" is directly to the point on every viewpoint I've seen expressed here. The opener can continue to point out its diversity in the next few sentences. It could conclude with a link to [[Diversity in computer science]], which needs more content in itself.
* One particular issue I have noticed about the word "computation" is that it a subset, or subsets, from the "[http://web.sau.edu/LillisKevinM/csci410/Fall2004/Formal%20Process.html formal definition for a process]. We could say "Computer science is the study of processes" and that would cover computation and more. It even passes the google test. This, however, is different from what can be computationally modelled. "Computation" provides insight at general, but that general sense makes it kind of ambiguous of what it models. Some have said that such ambiguity is a feature of the word in that it freely describes CS. Consequently, this implies that only by the study of computation may one know CS. These computations and models are only one of many paradigms.
* In ''[http://www.princeton.edu/~mike/softsci.htm Software as Science - Science as Software]'', there are several standpoints, comparisons, and contrasts made, for example: (I suggest to read the article before my annotations)
::''There are two features of the situation which have implications for how we might approach the history of software. First, as COSERS itself observed, "[E]ven though all the levels of the hierarchy which computer systems can be interpreted as algorithms, <font style="background-color:yellow;">the study of algorithms and the phenomena related to computers are not coextensive</font>, since there are important organizational, policy, and nondeterministic aspects of computing that do not fit the algorithmic mold."[33] The observation raises the questions of what mold those aspects do fit, that is to say, what science, if any, encompasses the phenomena not covered by algorithms. The second feature is the complexity of computer systems that seems to place even their algorithmic aspects beyond the reach of mathematics. The first feature has implications for software as engineering, the second for science as software.''
: This starts a contrast that states a paradigm (like in the computation paradigm pointed above) in which computers are purely mathematical machines is "misleading."
::''<nowiki>[The real world physical system]</nowiki> is where the bulk of the crucial errors have been made, and that is where software engineering has focused its attention since the 1970s. But that is also where the science of software moves away from the computer into the wider world and interacts with the sciences (if they exist) pertinent to the systems to be modeled computationally. There it becomes a question of how to express those sciences computationally and of how to evaluate the fit between the target system and the computational model.[35] But that is a question that software engineers share with scientists who have turned to the computer to take them into realms that are accessible neither to experiment nor to analytical mathematics. Intellectually, professionally, and historically, it links software as science to science as software.''
: It further states later on:
::''However, the model would only bring insight if one understood how the mathematics worked, if not analytically, at least computationally. But here again, the state of knowledge posed a barrier to understanding, as that approach encountered difficulties.''
: That reiterates how the insight on computation and how it leads to algorithms, data structures, computer systems and so-on is not so intuitive even by those well-versed in mathematics. The article further explains how the generalizations by mathematics (and mathematicians) becomes their vision; hence, these visions are not historic fact, but they are their goals.
: We can use "computation," but it it can not exclude the historic facts of computer science in the definition. In "CS is the study of computation and information," the study of computation relates the goal and expects the reader to understand the insight. It further expects the reader to associate such insight to data structures, algorithms, and so-on. It further asks the reader to understand this is an encyclopedia, a compendium of knowledge based on historic facts, that it is not a historic fact that by the study of computation ones acheives full insight on computer science (as noted above). Further, it asks the reader to understand it is a historic fact of how there are disciplines of computer science that use the study of computation as its main tool to acheive insight. I doubt any selection of readers have a equal acquirement on this implication from only stated "study of computation" and what little else is presented in the article.
:: ''In some instances, the science of computation has laid the groundwork for computational science.''
: There is a distinction. Computer science is seen to spin off computational science.
:: ''... it is hard to see how to distinguish the science of programs and programming from programming itself. As maligned as the dichotomy between "pure" and "applied" has recently become, it perhaps retains some value here. It is a question of focus and motivation. Does one want to understand the nature of programs and programming, or does one write programs for the purpose of achieving or understanding something else? In the latter case, the science applied offers no insight into computational questions. Indeed, as I argue in conclusion, the software more often becomes a means of investigating the science, even to the point of replacing the science's real-world objects.''
: This hints on why I do not exclude computation from the science:
: ''In the course of the discussion, participants asserted several principles as indisputable, in particular that science is about nature, not about things of our own creation, and that mathematics is not a science, but a tool for doing science. From the first, some people concluded that, as an artifact, software could not be the subject of a science; from the second, that grounding software in mathematics did not make a science of it. Despite my own insistence on computers and programs as artifacts, neither of these principles is quite as firm as it seems. Much of the work in history of science over the past half-century speaks against them.''
: The document further goes into the empirical:
:: ''Others have taken a more empirical approach, believing that mathematics is not adequate to explain what computers can do, especially when we have not told them (or do not believe we have told them) to do it. But, as envisioned by Herbert Simon, the empirical science of computational processes would be no less scientific for being empirical and, indeed, a science of the artificial.''
: Obviously, I am not alone on my stance even if a few other wikipedians here feel I am the only one.
:: ''So too with the theory of computation. Does it have laws? Surely Turing's halting theorem sets a limit on what can be computed by demonstrating what cannot be. Showing that a problem is equivalent to the halting problem relegates it to the realm of the incomputable. Similarly, the theory of computational complexity establishes through a variety of models of limited Turing machines what resources are required to compute classes of problems and the tradeoffs between time and space involved in doing so. Are these scientific results about nature? Well, there's a body of literature that says yes. It is a tenet of the new computational sciences that nature can't compute any better than a Turing machine. Or rather, anything nature can do, a computer can do too, given enough time and memory.''
: That makes the distinction between computation and software:
:: ''Are these laws of software? In discussing the implications of software as science for software as engineering, I addressed the limits of theoretical computer science in addressing the software development process. That process begins with the translation of a portion of the real world into the first of a series of computational models which culminate in a program running on a specific machine. Verification of the result involves two different issues: the goodness of the computational model with respect to the world it is supposed to model and the accuracy of the translation of that model into the instruction set of the computer on which it is running. Whether the model itself is adequate is ultimately not a question of software but of the developer's understanding of the world. It may be a scientific question, but the science involved is not about software or computers. The science of software as I have construed it pertains to the second issue. It begins where the model becomes a program: how, and to what extent, can we assure ourselves that the program is doing what we have written it to do? How that question has been formulated and addressed is the subject of the history of software as science''
: There are those who model computation after nature to develop software programs, and there are those that program software to explore nature. Both are within computer science.
* It was kind of lengthy, but I wanted to put forth the idea how "computer systems," being hardware, software, and other kinds of systems, is similiar to "the phenomena of computers." We can subsitute "computer systems" for "the phenomena of computers," yet the later emphasizes the scientific observation. Without my own original research, the above article shows how "computer systems" is distinct from "computation" and "information" and can not be left out of the presented definition of computer science. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 18:49, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

* About the new compromises, which I didn't see before my previous post: they do work in the right direction. My suggestion from those is a combination of the two:

::"Computer science is the study of the implementation of computation and phenomena related to computers." &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]]

:CS is not ''just'' about implementation and computers themselves; "computer systems" as part of a study of CS tends to focus on implementing and optimizing software to run on systems.  CS does ''include'' implementation, but it also includes a lot of other things that have very little to do with implementation or "phenomena related to computers"; for example, [[lambda calculus]].  My proposal includes the current definition (which I believe to be sufficient) and a specific reference to computer systems (as you seem to want), in the context in which a computer scientist studies computer systems (not the "can you fix my printer?" sense).

==Definition resolution==
[[Image:NonFreeImageRemoved.svg|right|thumb|[[Sam the Eagle|You are all weirdos]].]]

Dear all -- there was a long and extended debate on the exact nature of the sentence beginning the article. I was brought in as part of [[Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal|medcabal]]; see: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-01-28_Computer_Science_dispute]. After a lot of work by everyone, we have arrived at a consensus solution (we took a brief poll and there were no objections, though there were definitely a few "weak supports"); the consensus is:

:'''Computer science''' is the study of the theoretical foundations of [[information]] and [[computation]] and their implementation and application in [[computer system]]s.

The long discussion which produced this consensus is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Computer_science/definition_archive here]. There is a lot of material there, and a good amount of interesting discussion; please consider reading it when updating discussions within the article about definitional issues. Sometimes archiving talk pages can be controversial; I don't mean to be "sneaky" -- I'm just trying to clear up the talk page so that it can be used for other discussions.

Let me add a few brief thoughts of my own:

# There is no singular definition of computer science. There are many competing, sometimes contradictory definitions. I am happy to see that not only is there extensive and sourced discussion of this elsewhere in the article, but there is a [[Alternative_definitions_of_computer_science|whole separate article]] discussing these issues in greater detail. All of the people involved in the dispute have a great deal to contribute to improving these things, and I hope they will continue to do so.
# Because of these things, please try not to place too much importance on this single sentence. This sentence doesn't mean that other definitions cannot be discussed elsewhere. Really this definition is only an "initial guide" to a reader coming in.
# There is definitely a certain amount of frustration going around, but we did manage to work together and resolve the dispute. It is ''not'' a perfect resolution (not everyone, indeed no-one but me, is saying that it's a super solution.) But surprisingly, we do I believe have something that will "stick" for the parties involved. On the internet, that is rare.

Thank you all very much for bearing with me, even when I've been a bit pushy myself.

== Often hotly ==

:''Because of its relative newness, there are some alternative definitions of computer science and its strict definition is often hotly debated''

''...on Wikipedia.'' (I'm tempted to insert that :-) While I don't disagree with the statement, I wonder if the modifier "often hotly" is necessary. Also I'm not sure if "Because of its relative newness" is accurate. There are many fields of study far newer than computer science, whose definitions aren't debated.

I agree completely, that sentences and the one following it are in need of some rephrasing.  Here's my suggestion:

: Because Computer science is a rapidly evolving field, it is difficult to define precisely.  Research into the area often crosses into other disciplines, including, among many others, [[cognitive science]], [[physics]] (see [[Quantum Computing]]), and [[psychology]] (see [[Human Computer Interaction]])

===Evolution and divergence===

On the same paragraph:
:"Because computer science is a rapidly evolving field, it is difficult to define precisely."

I wanted to find a source for this. However, the sources found stated historical claims for different perspectives. We can point out individual areas that have evolved rapidly, but, unless a source can be found, the statement needs to reflect the references:
:Computer science research has branched off and into other disciplines: [[computer engineering]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], [[physics]] (see [[quantum computing]]), [[linguistics]], [[software engineering]], and others. Because computer science has evolved like this, there are divergent perspectives on its definition. The methods involved to train individuals and the [[diversity of computer science|diversity in computer science]] has led to its likely debatable definition.
I changed "computer science grads" to "individuals" and touched-up on the rest. "Diversity in computer science" is more impartial than "alternative definitions." &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 13:28, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

I like the tone of your proposal, but the language doesn't seem to flow well to me.  How about the following revision for the paragraph:

:Research into computer science often crosses into other disciplines, including, among many others, computer engineering, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, physics (see quantum computing), linguistics, and software engineering.  Because of the [[diversity of computer science]] and the variety of careers pursued by computer scientists, perspectives on its precise definition may vary.

It's a fairly minimal change, but I think it works better than the current rev.  What do you think?  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 16:30, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

:I prefer this version. As you say, it flows better. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 16:53, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

:I'm afraid I don't understand what "methods involved to train individuals" is supposed to mean.

Can you please elaborate on what you are trying to say with the "methods" phrase, and perhaps we can find a phrasing that more clearly expresses your intent. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 18:30, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Where did "variety of careers" come from? Here is the source for my shorted exerpt: "''it is argued that the diversity of research paradigms in computer science may be responsible both for our difficulties in deciding how computer scientists should be trained and for divergences of opinion concerning the nature of computer science research.''" [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807694]

::# The sentence you quote states that the diversity of computer science is responsible for difficulties in deciding in training, ''and also'' that the diversity of CS makes defining the nature of CS difficult. It does ''not'' claim that the difficulties deciding on training are responsible for the difficulties in defining CS. 
::# This from the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, which is composed of representatives from the ACM, IEEE-Computer, and AIS: ''Computer science is a young discipline that is evolving rapidly from its beginnings in the 1940's. ... Because of the rapid evolution it is difficult to provide a complete list of computer science areas.'' [http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html] 
::# From the same website: ''A professional computer scientist must have a firm foundation in the crucial areas of the field and will most likely have an in-depth knowledge in one or more of the other areas of the discipline, depending upon the person's particular area of practice.'' - which implies that computer scientists have a variety of "areas of practice" (i.e. careers). From the previous quote, we can infer that these various careers are hard to list. As a result, defining CS by listing the areas in which computer scientists work will also be hard.

I stand by my original phrasing:

:"Because computer science is a rapidly evolving field, it is difficult to define precisely."

The word evolution in and of itself implies that there is a diversity of different incarnations, some of which have been succesful, and others which have not been.  My phrasing is quite general, as I think is appropriate for the introductory paragraph.  A quick google search for "computer science rapidly evolving" shows that university CS departments describe their discipline in that exact way. --[[User:Jonovision|Jonovision]] 21:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Ok. It still has to be reflective. I know some here hate to write in the past, but that is how the words should be used. Here is another suggestion with cause-n-effect type expression, to use "computer-science research" as a group, and to combine everybody's ideas with an added Dijkstra perspective:
:Computer-science research has branched itself into many disciplines, which includes, among many others, computer engineering, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, physics (see quantum computing), linguistics, and software engineering. Because computer science has evolved like this, there are [[diversity of computer science|divergent perspectives]], and, in the management of this on how computer scientist should be trained, it is difficult to define precisely. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 23:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

: It's good that you're trying to be as precise as possible, but this seems to suggest that computer science started as a single endeavour, and subsequently branched out into different areas.  The reality is that there have been many different starting points in the evolution of computer science, and since the beginning computer scientists have both taken and contributed ideas to and from other disciplines. --[[User:Jonovision|Jonovision]] 00:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Consider that "computer-science research" is seen either strictly as an explicit group or an implied group metaphorically, it is not precise to a single endeavour.

I've removed the following line from the first paragraph:

: Still others, like [[computer programming]], study the process of formally describing computations (using [[programming languages]]) for use in [[computer system]]s.

First of all, let me apologize if this change comes too soon after the mediation.  However, I feel it is necessary.  Computer programming is "the craft of implementing one or more interrelated abstract algorithms using a particular programming language to produce a concrete computer program."  It is not the "study of processes of describing computations", as suggested in that sentence.

If you can get wikipedians to remove all the references and notes to the article on [[Hugo Chavez]], then I might be persuaded. There is a reason why that article has so many notes and references, it needs its sources. The few people that are familiar with this article on CS may not want the sources, but there are lots of people that can use them. Perhaps, make a suggestion to the developers of mediawiki to have an option to turn notes and references off. I've been in other highly controversial articles, and the feedback always states to use notes and references -- it is a must. The policy even states to cite sources.  The article needs more references -- not less.

That said, it might be productive to have "Fields within computer science" and "Fields to which computer scientists contribute", for those fields that aren't usually considered CS but that computer scientists do study (like [[graph theory]], [[category theory]], and [[computer architecture]]).  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 18:34, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

I would agree that graph theory isn't directly under the purview of CS (just like category theory and linear algebra are useful fields for a computer scientist to know, but not really CS per se).  Cryptography is definitely CS, just ask [[Manuel Blum]].  However, computer architecture as Wikipedia defines it isn't really CS either, but rather computer engineering.  CS students typically do learn about machine architecture, but usually as part of a [[systems programming]] course, where the curriculum focuses on programming for the processor, cache, and bus &mdash; ''not'' designing them.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 03:08, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:Agreed. Computer architecture is mostly subsumed under Computer Engineering, although Computer Science programs will inevitably include some courses of it. I think we can include architecture, but only if we emphasize the theory of it (or how it is still taught under Computer Science, but not emphasized). -- [[User:Evanx|<sup><b><font color="brown">Evanx</font></b></sup>]]<small>([[User_talk:Evanx|tag?]])</small> 05:11, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:"Architecture" has a duality as part science and part engineerial. To make it distinct to be either one makes a judgement. On the basis of specification, it is a science. On the basis to implement that specification, it is engineerial. It appears there are different opinions on how these specifications are made and how they are implemented, and that seems to be the cause to these questions of where this field falls into. It appears to focus over the word "design" as in to design its specification or to design its implementation. The article itself states a conceptual design. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 16:05, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

::You make a good point there; though the usual role of CA in CS is unidirectional &mdash; computer scientists, with a few exceptions, learn about architectural designs rather than actually making them.  In all, I'd say it's very similar to the cases of graph theory, matrix algebra, category theory, etc., which I wouldn't consider fundamentally CS either, though there is a bit of cross-over.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 16:36, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:::When computer science students learn about architectural design, do they learn how to write specifications or to actually make the architecture? Here is an image to relate this: http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emike/Image11.gif. The concerns at the top-level are engineerial. The rest is computer science. Once the model is done, it goes back to engineerial. Note, the hardware design crosses-over to a part of the science even if the construction process is not science. Instead of unidirectional, would you agree it is circular? &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 17:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

::::To some extent, certainly; [[computational model]]s feed into [[computer architecture]], which comes back into [[systems programming]].  But generally the interaction of a computer scientist doesn't include designing the physical system, just designing the model and using the system.  That's not to say that computer scientists can't ''also'' be computer engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and the like &mdash; in fact, the world would be a pretty boring place if all computer scientists studied only computer science.  It's just that the physical design exercises a skill set that is beyond the scope of computer science proper.  --[[User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 18:22, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::These models can get very detailed with abstraction even without any physical implementation involved. Those details evolve as engineers try to implement the specifications and find problems as they implement the model specification. In the past, engineers had to be trained to deal with such problems themselves and find a way to still implement the specification. This is where the general cross-over is seen. Instead of the engineers responsibility to fill in the gaps, they can, today, send the data back to the scientists. (thrown exception) It becomes the responsibility of the scientists to understand the abstraction as it relates to real world. This is why the physical design is not just excluded from computer science as far as the levels of detail in abstraction. It appears fair to remove the "In computer engineering" from the start of the article. It also appears fair to say it falls into both disciplines of computer science and computer engineering in the article, as the architecture can be purely an abstraction. As for "boring," that's why we have supercomputers that can simulate all aspects of a computer right down to the chemical level, which also effectively simulates those caffeinated systems through an emulated model on a simulated computer that is on a real supercomputer. Anyways... just my two cents.... &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 21:31, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Is "Soft Computing" a major branch of Computer Science? ==

According to [[Soft Computing]] (aka Computational Intelligence), and the various links it contains: 

:Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the human mind. The guiding principle of soft computing is: Exploit the tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. 

:The principal constituents of Soft Computing (SC) are Fuzzy Logic (FL), Neural Computing (NC), Evolutionary Computation (EC) Machine Learning (ML) and Probabilistic Reasoning (PR), with the latter subsuming belief networks, chaos theory and parts of learning theory.[http://www.soft-computing.de/ (Y.Jin's Soft Computing portal)]

:Enclosed in the name computational intelligence is a `message', according to scientific folklore it is chosen to indicate the link to and the difference with artificial intelligence. While some techniques within computational intelligence are often counted as artificial intelligence techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms, or neural networks) there is a clear difference between these techniques and traditional, logic based artificial intelligence techniques. In general, typical artificial intelligence techniques are top-to-bottom where, i.e., the structure of models, solutions, etc. is imposed from above. Computational intelligence techniques are generally bottom-up, where order and structure emerges from an unstructured beginning. [http://www.cs.vu.nl/ci/ (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam)]



Soft Computing, aka Computational Intelligence, essentially consists of a collection of approaches, such as fuzzy computing, neural computing, and genetic algorithms, whose strength lies in modelling the brain, the mind, or genetic evolution, and whose main domain of application is Artificial Intelligence (AI). It has not been widely accepted as a seperate field from AI, nor should it be. It is at most a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. In my experience, it is a very obscure term, even within AI. I therefore suggest that it be listed as a subfield of AI, and not as a branch of CS.

I have looked at the fields of Computer science on this page and security seems to fit all of them and none of them.  For example, security involves math, theory, algorithms, data structures, programming languages, compilers, and on down the list.  Security professionals and researchers have to know something about all of these areas.  However, security is not limited to math, theory, algorithms, etc. If I were to give a name to the field, I would probably call it [[Information security]] instead of [[Data security]].

== Lead sentence ==

An anon user keeps removing the word "theoretical" from the lead sentence. While I'm not particularly wed to that word myself, the lead took a looooong time to hash out (Don't believe me? Look back through the archives), and it'd be better to propose any changes to the lead here first so that they can be discussed by any interested parties. Normally I wouldn't worry so much about a single word, but...well...take a look through archives yourself.

As an aside, if you make an edit with the comment "revert, see talk page", it's helpful to actually say something on the talk page as well.

::It's not just theoretical though.  Its concepts of the storage of information have been proven.  While it does encomass the theoretical field, it is not bound to it. [[Special:Contributions/75.62.37.143|75.62.37.143]] ([[User talk:75.62.37.143|talk]]) 19:15, 24 December 2008 (UTC)

:::::Leaving it "as is" would mean leaving the word "theoretical" in place, since that was the consensus version of the lead (which, as I've pointed out several times, took a long time to get to). I encourage you to look back through the archives of this talk page (in particular [[Talk:Computer_science/Archive_5|Archive 5]]) to see how we ended up with the current definition.

: I think 75.62.37.143 misinterprets the meaning of the current lead. If we add some extra parentheses for clarity it would read: "..is the study of (the theoretical foundations of information and computation) and (their implementation and application in computer systems)." So it would already include both theory and practice. Cheers, —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 11:43, 26 December 2008 (UTC)

::::::If, in your opinion, there is no difference between "theoretical" and "actual" foundations, then I'm afraid I can't see why you are insisting on removing the word "theoretical" from the lead. Given what you've said above, the phrases ''"the study of the foundations of information and computation"'' and ''"the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation"'' mean the same thing. If you have looked back through the archives of previous debate over the lead, as I previously encouraged you to do, you will have seen that the word "theoretical" was included because several editors felt that it was important to make it clear that computer science includes theory as well as practice. Since inclusion of the word "theoretical" both satisfies those other editors and (based on your comments above) makes no difference to the meaning of the sentence, why remove it? --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] <small>([[User talk:Allan McInnes|talk]])</small> 09:43, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

:::::::::I fail to see how removing the word "theoretical" makes it ''clearer'' that computer science includes a theoretical component. As Ruud pointed out above, the existing sentence explicitly mentions both the theoretical and practical components of computer science (indeed, it was specifically constructed to do so).

Dear anonymous editor, as I've mentioned several times now, the current lead sentence was arrived at through a rather long process of consensus-building among a number of editors. Please understand that this makes us hesitant to alter the lead sentence without careful consideration. I think that Ruud and I have made it clear that simple deletion of the word "theoretical" is not going to fly, given the arguments you have advanced so far. Nor do I consider a parenthetical phrase, as you inserted into the article earlier, to be good style within a lead sentence. If you have other suggestions for how we might address your objections to the current lead sentence, I'd be happy to discuss them here. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] <small>([[User talk:Allan McInnes|talk]])</small> 11:53, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

::As I've already stated, I don't see removing the word "theoretical" as being acceptable. It was specifically included in the lead, for reasons that are made clear in the archived discussions about the lead sentence.

::::Well, it's difficult to know what to suggest, since your stated desire is simply to remove the word "theoretical". Assuming that you're willing to move beyond that towards something that's more of a compromise, let's start with the current lead:

:::::'''''Computer science''' (or '''computing science''') is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems.''

::::I suppose there's a case to be made that the sentence isn't sufficiently clear, since you are apparently able to read it in a way that implies only the theoretical aspect of CS. Would the following be any more acceptable?

:::::'''''Computer science''' (or '''computing science''') is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation, and of practical techniques for their implementation and application in computer systems.''

::::Ruud, do you have any comments? --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] <small>([[User talk:Allan McInnes|talk]])</small> 08:18, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

::::Also, I'd like to again reiterate my request for you to ''not'' modify the lead sentence until we've reached an agreement here on the talk page.

::::::# Leave the lead sentence as is (I understand that you object to this course action, but then I object to your removal of the word "theoretical")

I believe that the words "and teaching" should be removed from the lead sentence, although obviously computer science is an academic subject I think that the lead sentence should concentrate on the actual objective/meaning of computer science itself. I believe that the taught aspect of computer science is not its primary meaning, rather more the study of, and hence the taught aspect should not be mentioned in the lead sentence. Any thoughts?

== What about [[Mathematical chemistry]]?! ==

I was very surprised when I had found [[Computational chemistry]] in the section "Numerical and symbolic computation".What about [[Mathematical chemistry]] in this case? Note, please, "Mathematical chemistry has also sometimes been called computer chemistry, but should not be confused with computational chemistry." ([[Mathematical chemistry]]). Also [[Bioinformatics]], [[Computational physics]] and many other scientific areas should not be noted specially as the Fields of computer science. The Computational chemistry, Mathematical chemistry and Computer chemistry are fields of modern chemistry, Computational physics is field of physics, the Graph theory is field of mathematics. Otherwise we have to add a lot of fields from different areas where computers and programming and algorithm's theory and practice are used today!

Also, very important,  mathematics is ''pure theoretical science'', but physics, chemistry, biology ets. are ''experimental sciences''. Is Computer science pure theoretical science (like mathematics) or experimental science? --[[User:Tim32|Tim32]] ([[User talk:Tim32|talk]]) 19:51, 6 May 2009 (UTC)

== More visual ''Fields of'' section ==

How about using a more visual categorisation system in the ''Fields of computer science'' section, this might make the article more appealing to many people. I have made some examples below of how this could look (the ''Fields of mathematics'' section from the [[Mathematics]] article was used as inspiration).

:Agreed it falls short. Computer Science is concerned with [[data structures]] and [[algorithms]], natch. Use of the term "[[information]]" here is simply too broad and ambiguous to be helpful; moreover, it is (often) incorrect. Information is data in human-useful context, whereas computer science is concerned most directly with collection, storage, presentation of [[data]] and its [[data processing|processing]]. I dislike the term "computation" as well, as it sounds a whole bunch like what is being described, but I decided to live with it. It is simply not worth my time to get into a long debate or reversion war on either of these terms but using the term "information" here is a serious compromise on reality. Please check out the information entry to get an idea of what I mean. Thanks, - TO [[User:Tee Owe|Tee Owe]] ([[User talk:Tee Owe|talk]]) 19:48, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

::"Data structure" seems too tight a definition to me. For example, cryptography or compression are clearly concerned with [[Information theory|information]], are both often considered part of computer science, and neither are directly concerned with data structures (except insofar as data structures may be used in their implementation). Furthermore, there is at least one reference in the lead that specifically says "Computer science is the study of information" (or something like that anyway). Perhaps the link to [[information]] is incorrect, but I think the general sentiment is about right. 
::As for algorithm vs. computation, it's again a case of the specific vs the general. There are -- at least according to some people -- non-algorithmic computations. Examples include quantum computing (no sequence of steps), and reactive or interactive programs (some researchers claim that intermediate inputs and interaction with environment fall outside the [[Algorithm characterizations| standard definitions of an "algorithm"]]). 
::Finally, I'll just point out that the lead sentence as it exists right now is the end result of an extremely lengthy debate and consensus-building exercise a couple of years back (dig back through the talk page archives if you want to see the debate in its entirety), trying to reach a version that satisfied ''many people'' rather than any one individual. That said, if you want to reopen the debate, by all means do so. 
::--[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] <small>([[User talk:Allan McInnes|talk]])</small> 02:02, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

::: Cryptography and compression are algorithmic, not informational (yes I know cryptography is debatably both, but the act of encoding and decoding are algorithms).  Do you have any more examples that would support the term using the term information instead? The big thing here is that computer science and [[information systems]] (IS) are distinct disciplines and the description for both should clearly delineate them as such.  Differences include:
:::-IS is about information use (by people) and meaning, and is indifferent as to how data is stored and retrieved within machine boundaries. 
:::-CS is does not require data to have human-usable context, therefore it is just data and not yet information until it is presented in context
:::-Computer Science is strictly scientific and objective, e.g. changes in data structures and algorithms can be measured and tested. 
:::-Information Systems leverages applied science and engineering to solve problems, exploit opportunities and address directives in business and society.  There is more, but I think this expresses my concern. [[User:Tee Owe|Tee Owe]] ([[User talk:Tee Owe|talk]]) 08:44, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

::::The implementation of cryptographic systems or compression schemes may be algorithmic in nature. The study and analysis of such systems is however quite firmly rooted in [[information theory]]. As for other examples, here are a few:
::::* Several different universities from that characterize computer science as a study of (among other things) information:

:::::* [http://www.uaf.edu/catalog/current/programs/comp_sci.html "Computer science is the study of information handling and its application to the problems of the world."]
::::* Various articles and other discussions (dating from the early days of CS in the 1960s all the way through to 2010) on the nature of computer science that mention "information" as a key element of computer science:
:::::* George E. Forsythe, [ftp://reports.stanford.edu/www/pub/cstr.old/reports/cs/tr/66/39/CS-TR-66-39.pdf "A University's Educational Program in Computer Science" (1966)], says "I consider computer science in general to be the art and science of representing and processing information and, in particular, processing information with the logical engines called automatic digital computers." 
:::::* Peter Wegner, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807694 "Research Paradigms in Computer Science" (1976)], identifies several definitions of CS including "Computer science is the study of information structures".

(there's also some discussion of the general idea of "information" as being central to CS).
:::::* David Evans, [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/talks/richmond/ "1000 Things Every Self-Respecting Computer Scientist Should Know" (2003)], asserts that "Computer science is the study of information processes."
:::::* Peter Denning, [http://www.cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/PUBS/CACMcols/computation.pdf "What is Computation?" (CACM 2010)], claims that the current view of computer science is the "Study of information processes, both natural and artificial".
::::* A couple of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]-endorsed definitions that specifically describe computer science as being concerned with information:
:::::* The IEEE/ACM Computer Science Accreditation Board's old [http://web.archive.org/web/20080617030847/http://www.csab.org/comp_sci_profession.html "Computer Science as a Profession"] description says "Computer science is a discipline that involves the understanding and design of computers and computational processes.

:::::* The ACM Education Board Task Force on the Core of Computer Science, [http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf "Computing as a Discipline" (1989)], defines computer science as "the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application."
::::If you're looking for specific examples of sub-fields that are concerned with information then you might start with all of the work on databases and information retrieval, the fields of cryptography and compression, the study of information flow in program security, the study of information representations (entity-relationship and object models, AI research on knowledge representation, low-level design of number representations like IEEE floating point, etc.), or work on the semantic web. There're probably others, but those are what I can think of off the top of my head.

:::Thank you Allan McInnes for your well-thought and detailed answer.  Unfortunately it does not really address the concern.  It occurs to me the problem is semantic.  In everyday English language, we often use words like "information" and "data" interchangeably as synonyms.  In each of your examples, one can typically substitute "data" for the term "information".  Yes "information" can mean just primarily "data", but we have an opportunity for its meaning to take on more precision.  I suggest it is this difference in meaning that better defines the distinction between the two disciplines (IS/CS).  So left like it is, the interested reader will miss the opportunity to see the distinction between the two disciplines as well as the important distinction between the two concepts.  I have no problem with CS practitioners wishing to cross the boundary and practice IS, but we all need to agree on where that boundary is. The existing description only further muddies the waters.

::::While you may be correct that there is an opportunity for the meaning of "information" to take on more precision, the fact remains that standard usage of the word "information" is -- as you freely admit -- not the meaning you are trying to ascribe to it. Nor is Wikipedia the venue to attempt to redefine (or more tightly define) the meaning of the word. As I think the references I've provided above show, the word "information" (in its standard usage) is quite widely used in descriptions of computer science. You may disagree with that usage, feel that sharper distinctions should be drawn, or feel that boundaries need to be better defined, but Wikipedia is not the place to try to draw those boundaries or make those distinctions. Certainly not in the lead of an article. It ''might'' be reasonable to address the distinction further down the article, ''if'' that view is [[WP:WEIGHT|significant]] and [[WP:v|verifiable]] (in other words, if there has been a lot of stuff written about the fact that computer science isn't really about studying information because "information" means something other than "data"). --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] <small>([[User talk:Allan McInnes|talk]])</small> 00:07, 24 May 2010 (UTC)

::::::Presumably the difference would be seen in which interpretation of "information" the different disciplines opt to use in explaining themselves, and also in what they claim to do with "information".

::::::As you have said, this may not be the place to "fix" it, but I think there is a mostly unconscious effort to expand the meaning of CS beyond its essential concern for data structures and algorithms.  For example information theory is not really in the domain of CS but in that of applied math and arguably engineering. For every topic beyond data structure and algorithms that one might argue also belongs with CS, I suspect we can find a better "home" discipline.  To make use of your analogy on "cars" we could acceptably say both topics involve maintaining a car.  But to use the phrase "maintaining a car" in its first sentence might give readers a skewed perspective on auto racing.  This is the sort of thing that I suggest is happening here.

== This entire article needs better structure and Software Engineering ==

I find that this article has some serious structural issues, we need to eliminate redundant sections, and have a better top down hierarchy.

Also, just for those who don't know, Software Engineering is a direct subfield of Computer Science. It has undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate specialization degrees with associated research and development arms in both industry and academia. Also, most people who are qualified to work as software engineers are in fact computer scientists or computer engineers (software). I will admit however most computer scientists don't necessarily choose to specialize in software engineering. Computer engineers who choose to specialize in software are also taking mostly computer science courses, with some core engineering, electrical and circuit design courses added. Anyone who honesty disputes this point better have some serious evidence of the contrary.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dimoes|Dimoes]] ([[User talk:Dimoes|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dimoes|contribs]]) 05:02, 31 January 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

[[User:Palaeovia|Palaeovia]] 17:07, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

I really think a strong statement needs to be made of the division between Computer Science and Programming.  They have almost nothing to do with each other.  

Programming a computer is the process of enumarating exacting steps for the computer to perform, to solve a specific problem or a specific set of problems.  Computer Science studies things like the complexity and computibility of problems and classes of problems.

Compare to Math or Physics vs Engineering.  While it is quite helpful for the engineer to be familiar with the basics of Math and Physics, the actual work of engineering tends to be driven more by practical specific guidelines...  The engineer does not analyze the physical properties of steel to determine how much stress it can withstand; the known value is obtained from prior art.  When working on the "cutting edge", some testing of a new alloy's properties will be done, but those will likely be the pragmatic real world testing, such as building a prototype and seeing when it breaks, and then staying a safe margin below that point.

Likewise, while knowing Computer Science is helpful to the programmer, it's not what will be used to solve the problem assigned.  It is so rare that an actual uncomputable problem would be assigned, that it is never considered if the problem can be solved, except in frustration if having difficulty in finding a solution (and generally the problem is a failure of imagination, or of finding many solutions which are not practical because of the time they take to process -- not really one of computability).

Normally, one looks to existing solutions (programs) to try to borrow as much of the existing solutions as possible.  When multiple possible solutions are considered, then a basic analysis of the complexity of each can help the programmer to select the one which is likely to have better performance.  But, similiar to engineering, a small scale version of each method may be used to prototype each method instead, to get specific "practical" results for comparison.  When the complexity analysis indicates a clear winner, then knowing how to do it can save time and effort.  But since complexity analysis may find that several of the solutions have the same general complexity, the programmer may still have to choose from some of the solutions, and so may still have to prototype them, or rely on experience and intuition.

Once the rough solution method is selected, writing the detailed code and then debugging it is tied to the very specific details of the problem involved, and really unrelated to any of the mathematics or science.

== Comments from 3 pioneers ==
Given the above discssions on "what is computer science" here are some related comments:

...the harm was done: the topic became known as  computer science ---which, actually, is like referring to surgery as knife science ---and it was firmly implanted in people's minds that computing science is about machines and their peripheral equipment. - [[Edsgar Dijkstra]]

[[Peter Naur]] dislikes the very term computer science and suggest it be called dataology.

[[User:NevilleDNZ|NevilleDNZ]] 20:00, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

:True, it isn't really a science, more like an engineering discipline. However its worth noting that Dijkstra's comment doesn't really apply any more since most computer science courses have a heavy emphasis on software engineering. Personally I like the term "software engineering" since that's a pretty accurate description of the real-life discipline. [[User:Gwernol|Gwernol]] 20:29, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

:::There is a science behind software engineering, its [[Mathematics|math(s)]]. [[User:Gwernol|Gwernol]] 14:38, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

::::You mean like [[type theory]], the [[lambda calculus]], or the [[pi calculus]]? All of those, although mathematical in nature, are far more active areas of research in CS. Some originated in CS.

::::Regardless of what most CS courses teach (which is largely driven by market demands, and the fact that corporations hire CS graduates to be software engineers) there is a difference in the focus and goals of CS (as a discipline, rather than a degree program) and SE. There is of course substantial overlap in the areas of knowledge. But they remain different disciplines. [[David Parnas]] has done a good job of [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/parnas98software.html articulating the differences]. I'd also highly recommend Walter Vincenti's excellent book "What Engineers Know and How They Know It", which does a good job of explaining the essential differences between a science and an engineering discipline. --[[User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] <small>([[User talk:Allan McInnes|talk]])</small> 02:37, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

:: Saying that "Dijkstra's comment doesn't really apply any more since most computer science courses have a heavy emphasis on software engineering" is pretty much giving in to the fact that the industry won over the Computer Science department, and completely ignoring the fact that Computer Science as such still exists, just not in the major "courses".

I disagree with the idea that computer science isn't a science. In my department we do exactly the same kind of science as you find in biology, sociology, ecology, psychology, and physics. You can argue that maths and engineering aren't science, but they involve developing and evaluating models (of construction, for example) so, in every way that matters, computer science is a science.

One thing that gets left out from the view of computer science in regards to mathematics is the ability to perform those computations. Computer science does not ignore that ability; it tries to explain it with how it is possible in this physical world. A person that performs math is very much a computer, one that computes. One can see nerves and fingers as input and output devices and DNA as subroutines. People tend not to take that perspective because they remove the human body and mind from the equation, so to say. Anotherwords, they say that a desktop computer has nothing to do with the mathematics of computer science, yet that is just one of many viewpoints, architecturally. &mdash; [[User:Dzonatas|<b><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dz</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3F50FF">on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#5F80FF">at</FONT><FONT COLOR="#77B0FF">as</FONT></b>]] 15:16, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

== [[Academic Computer Science versus The Real World ]] ==

Professors at university have decomposed Computer Science into various mathematical topics.  It is not like people who get paid to write programs, design databases, and architect web sites have need of mathematics, as practiced by mathematicians, in order to do their work.  The big problem today, for people who are employed to put computers to profitable use, is keeping up with the fad du jour.  You dare not try to enroll at university to learn about the fad du jour.  FDJ is so laden with the stench of commerce that one is directed elsewhere -- an elsewhere where standards of the university are not upheld.  To me, the term Computer Science refers to knowledge about the hows and whys of computing from the perspective of mathematicians, who would never stoop to write commercial software.  Perhaps an overly broad indictment.  Surely some good is accomplished teaching undergraduates about the FOR loop.  But, there it is.--[[User:72.75.97.37|72.75.97.37]] 00:39, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

:First of all, this is not a forum topic for discussion on Computer Science, it's about the Wikipedia article. Second, the so-called "fad du jour" of any competent high-technology practice needs a strong science behind it, and that science will need a lot of mathematics and formal systems to be done. People who write programs for companies usually apply principles (such as those of formal programming languages and algorithms) that were formulated by a computer scientist, someone who was interested in the mathematics of the thing, even if they don't notice it. For instance, the handy apps you use to find the shortest path from one point to another in your town make usage of refined shortest path algorithms, and the formulation and subsequent proof of said algorithms is made mathematically (with the possible addition of heuristics), even if the people who apply them to make the software systems don't notice. I know the above comment is four years old, but it disturbs me. If you want a whole academic discipline whose obligation is to exclusively tell you how to be successful in the "fad du jour", you'd better look elsewhere, because company business is not what intellectual disciplines are about. --[[Special:Contributions/201.21.181.131|201.21.181.131]] ([[User talk:201.21.181.131|talk]]) 02:49, 25 June 2011 (UTC)

In Feb, starting in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_science&diff=413309994&oldid=413308340 this diff] by Ruud Koot, we had a big re-organization of the field into "theoretical" and "applied".  I think the old scheme made more sense, unless there's a reliable source for this partitioning.  Is there?  [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 04:35, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

: I've yet to find a good source giving a comprehensive listing of what the subfields of computer science are. To some extends this is always is always going to be a synthesis of various sources. Neither the current, nor the previous organization where properly supported by sources. The current organization does follow the [[SIGACT]] definition of theoretical computer science (see [[Theoretical computer science#Scope]]) except that they do not include Databases, data mining and information retrieval (but then again, they do co-organize the [[Symposium on Principles of Database Systems]]).
: In my opinion this organization is more useful the old one, there is an endless debate over whether fields such as software engineering are or are not parts of computer science proper and the previous terminology "Related fields" seems to take the position that they where not.
: A good counter-argument against this organization is that most subfields range from theoretical to applied. E.g in programming language theory there is a lot of purely mathematical work on semantics to much more applied work involving language design and compiler construction.
: —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 11:15, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

::It does seem very odd to have DB and IR as theoretical.  And you're right that most fields are mixed, theoretical and applied.  I think it would make more sense to get rid of the binary partition and just list the areas.  And just because a theory group claims certain areas as part of their scope (e.g. VLSI), that doesn't mean that area isn't also applied, or even mostly applied.   [[User:Dicklyon|Dicklyon]] ([[User talk:Dicklyon|talk]]) 15:33, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

::: Perhaps, yes. I think the currently listed subfields (i.e. the 3rd-level headers) are an accurate reflection of the various kinds of research groups you'll find at computer science departments. My motivation for further subdividing those mainly arose from the fact that 1) the number of subfields seemed a bit too large not to be further subdivided and 2) it seemed odd not to mention the ubiquitous term "theoretical computer science" here. I'm not quite satisfied with the current presentation, but I think the articles has bigger issues that need to be dealt with. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 21:32, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

::::Theoretical computer science was mentioned before your re-org, as one area with a few subareas, but not as a major division parallel to applied.  That wasn't so bad.

== Possible misquote ==

According to [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dijkstra Wikiquotes], the following is misattributed to Edsger Dijkstra . 

:Renowned computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] once stated: "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes."<ref>Research Methods for Science By Michael P. Marder page 14. Published by Cambridge University Press</ref>

Here is a copy of the text from wikiquote: 

* Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
** This quote is actually from [[Hal Abelson]], who in the opening to his 1986 lecture series on his famous book SICP said:
***"[Computer science] is not really about computers -- and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes...and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments.  Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use." http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQLUPjefuWA YouTube] 

Perhaps we should update the attribution? [[User:Kushal one|Kushal]] ([[User talk:Kushal one|talk]]) 20:22, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

: This has been discussed before. I have since found an even earlier reference ([http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0020739740050302 Hebenstreit 1974]) stating "We have attempted to show that while the processing of information is a science it is not one which can be apprehended by merely studying the basic tools, i.e. the computer and programming languages, any more than astronomy can be reduced to the detailed study and operation of telescopes."

== Removing "Data structures" from topic list ==

IMHO, Research and study on "Data structures" is not a distinct field from Algorithms. Additionally, the article on [[Data structures]] does not look as an introduction to a field of Computer Science, it just describes what a data structure is (confirming my idea).

IMHO, even Algorithms and Analysis of Algorithms should be replaced by a single item, but I've not performed the operation, waiting for more input.

So I've removed Data structures from the listing, in this diff:

== Is Computer Science, A Science? ==

Mathematics has been wrongly classified as an exact science, which is a contradiction if it is exact it can not be a science.
Computer science as a branch of mathematics, is not necessarily a science, at least not the more formal branches closely related to mathematical logic. Neural nets, evolving computing, and other inexact ways to compute are more experimental in nature, in such cases it is possible to talk about computing as a science. 
I have seen this discussion by mathematicians questioning their activity being classified as science, but I have not seen that discussion with respect of computing.
I know that Computer Science is a wide established name, but not necessarily correct. Some discussion should exist in literature, if someone knows that, please help to discuss this aspect in this article.<small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:189.178.74.12 |189.178.74.12 ]] ([[User talk:189.178.74.12 |talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/189.178.74.12 |contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

I would argue that this article's introduction wrongly classifies Computer Science as a science. The name is a misnomer in the same way calling mathematics "Number Science" would be, for just as with the fields of mathematics and logic, to describe it as "scientific" is at best describing only the potential for applying scientific processes to aspects of it and not accurately describing the totality of the entire field.

In the first paragraph from Education section, it's worth mentioning that computer science is promoted in the U.S as part of STEM education. So, I would add to the paragraph:

"Some countries, such as Israel, New Zealand and South Korea, have already included computer science in their respective national secondary education curriculum.[57][58] Several countries are following suit.[59]" In the U.S, computer science is promoted as part of STEM education, which is the academic disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
