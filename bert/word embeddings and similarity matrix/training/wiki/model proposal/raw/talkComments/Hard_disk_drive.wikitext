== HDD market vs SSD markets ==

An IP is asserting that SSDs now dominate the "market" referencing an Register article [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/31/flash_drive_revenues_twice_hdd_revenues NAND that's that... Flash chip industry worth twice disk drive biz].  This Register article is about the industries and not relevant markets.  Flash competes in many markets while HDDs are essentially in one market, that is secondary storage device for general-purpose computers - it is inapposite (apples vs fruit) to draw any conclusion from relative industry revenues.  In the relevent market revenues are about equal and HDD capacity shipped is about 10 times that of SDD.  Clearly SSD is eroding HDDs market share in the relevent market but at least based upon capacity shipped, HDD still dominates.

== Hard disk drive &equiv; platter drive?  ==

The first sentence currently says that hard drives are in all cases platter drives. To disambiguate the article's disposition, I suggest renaming the article to "platter drive", since this covers portable platter drives as much as fixed platter drives. Other articles use "hard drive" (linking this article or not) as shorthand for essentially "secondary storage that cannot be easily removed from the device that usually accesses it." In that group is also SSD, etc. Yes, it's absolutely different technology, but the end user experience is largely the same even if performance varies. [[User:D. F. Schmidt|D. F.

: No. That would violate [[WP:COMMONNAME]] as well as [[WP:NOR]]. The term "platter drive" never occurs in this article and afaict it is only used with any frequency in descriptive phrases such as "single-platter drive" or "three-platter drive". We don't make up names for things; we follow the nomenclature used in reliable sources. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 18:29, 15 June 2018 (UTC)

:: I can understand that part of it, but you didn't address the matter that other articles reference this article as a catch-all for platter drives, SSDs, SSHDs, and whatever other permanent storage drives exist. [[User:D. F. Schmidt|D. F. Schmidt]] ([[User talk:D. F. Schmidt|talk]]) 16:36, 18 June 2018 (UTC)

== Type of arm vertical movement versus comb ==

There was a significant technological change from the 1950s to the 1960s that should be addressed in the lede or in [[Hard disk drive#history]]. The [[IBM]] [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#350|350]], [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#355|355]], [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#1405|1405]] and [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#7300|7300]] had arms that moved both horizontally and vertically; a seek could take over half a second. With the [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#353|353]] and [[History of IBM magnetic disk drives#1301|1301]], IBM introduced the comb arrangement used by all subsequent moving-head disks, with one R/W head per recording surface (including synchronization surfaces). [[User:Chatul|Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul]] ([[User talk:Chatul|talk]]) 20:16, 26 December 2018 (UTC)
:It is already addressed in the [[Hard_disk_drive#History|history]] section of this article (the 350 had 50 disks and 2 heads while the 1301 used one head per 50 disks).

== Taxonomy/etymology ==

The differences between fixed disk and removable disk, hard/rigid disk and floppy disk should be brought out. Now they are not. There are merely a few notes. I changed redir of [[fixed disk]] here, but it would need a page of its own, for example. Not it almost reflects current usage as most fixed disks are hard disks. Not all hard disks are fixed disks, though.

There should probably be a clear tree and explanation on the terms by physical stature and function. Perhaps on [[mass storage]] or some such page. Then you could add the definitions and jumps to the different related articles.

==IEC Binary Prefixes==
My feeling is that all the storage capacity units in this article should be changed to the [[Binary_prefix#IEC_standard_prefixes|IEC Binary Prefixes]] for clarity.  The only objection I can see to this is that the traditional usage of the metric prefixes is more widely recognized.  However, I feel this is trivial since the binary abbreviations (i.e. KiB, MiB, GiB, as opposed to KB, MB, GB, respectively) are very similar to their metric counterparts, the difference will not be noticed by most readers, but it does a lot in the way of accuracy for this somewhat confusing matter.  In any case, the current state of the article is inconstistant in its use of IEC binary and metric prefixes, and something should be done either way.  Please post your comments either supporting or objecting to this, I didn't want to make this kind of an edit without first consulting some others. -- [[User:Uberpenguin|uberpenguin]] 18:10, 2005 Mar 28 (UTC)

Hmm, would anyone be willing to create and/or add a schematic of the interior of a hard drive?

I've taken a few photos of the interior of hard drives that I've licensed under Creative Commons.  [http://flickr.com/photos/jpstanley/74574598/ This] one might be appropriate. -JS

I was wondering what typical random access times might be for various types of drives. I just ran a benchmark program on my HD and I was wondering how it compared to others. KM

==Seek time needs clarification==

Typical current mass-market drives are quoted as having ''seek'' times of around 9ms. this is just the time to move the head to the correct radial position, but it doesn't include rotation of the disk to the right sector. to get the real seek time, you need to add rotational latency, which is 4.1ms for a 7200 RPM drive (60 seconds per minute divided by 7200 RPM divided by 2 (for average)) and you have an average access time of about 13.5ms. A seriously high-perforance drive has a seek time of under 4ms and latency of 2ms - i.e., 6ms average access. But these drives sacrifice capacity to achieve their very high performance, require a SCSI interface, and are fairly expensive. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]

==Other==

Tannin, any particular reason for reverting my change to an auto-generated thumbnail? There's really no reason to have separate thumbnail images anymore, and that particular image has already been listed on [[WP:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] after being replaced at [[Computer storage]]. [[User:DopefishJustin|DopefishJustin]] 03:44, Apr 26, 2004 (UTC)

Yes Justin. It looks terrible, and defaces a perfectly good photograph. If you want to fuzz-up an image, do it to one you took yourself. [[User:Tannin|Tannin]]

Mr Anon, please note that a ''hard disk'' is the ''internal part'' of a hard disk drive. The terms are not synonyms.

==MFM History==

I have no idea why the article claimed that MFM was invented for floppy drives.  As far as I've been able to determine, MFM was first used on the IBM 3330 in 1971.  The 3330 was most certainly NOT a floppy drive.  The first use of MFM for a floppy drive appears to have been the IBM 53FD drive, introduced in 1977.  --[[User:Brouhaha|Brouhaha]] 08:04, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== damage ==

There's nothing written about the damage to hard disks: we should have at least a cursory explanation of the terms MTBF (mean time before failure), bad sectors/blocks/clusters, BBR (bad block relocation), handling by software and by hardware, [[hot swap]]ping, something about refurbishing... --[[User:Joy|Joy <small><small>&#91;shallot&#93;</small></small>]] 14:29, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I *highly* second the suggestion for more info on failure modes. The article discusses head crashes in some detail, but are there other failure mechanisms? I've recently had a rash of early disk failures in a low-end server application. I'm suspicious that the cause was a substantial number of daily rsync operations that would have hit the directory tracks very hard on a daily basis. - And it was the directory tracks where the problems seemed to lie, none of the file data itself was every lost or corrupted, just the allocation table and extent maps were repeatedly corrupted. Is there a failure mechanism driven by repeated read/write cycles to the same area of the disk? (Dave Etchells, not a registered user)

:Repeated use of specific sectors is not a common failure mode.  The only thing similar is a particular use pattern may expose some design flaw that wasn't that obvious before.  --[[User:A D Monroe III|A D Monroe III]] 21:39, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

A discussion of HSA latch technology should also be included.  --[[User:Wikiwonki|Wikiwonki]] 15:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

== Decimal vs Binary ==

It seems like the following claim is incorrect.


“It is important to note that hard drive manufacturers often use the decimal definition of a gigabyte or megabyte. As a result, after the drive is installed it appears that a few gigabytes or megabytes have disappeared. In reality computers operate based upon the binary numeral system. In the decimal number system a gigabyte is 7.5% smaller than in the binary number system. The term "1.44 MB", often used to describe 1440 KB floppies (actually 1.47 MB or 1.4 MiB), introduced an anomalous definition of "megabyte" as 1 × 103 × 210 bytes (1 KKiB).”


The manufacturers actually state a smaller raw capacity of their drives. That is a 30GB harddrive is actually 30GB X 1.024.

The reason that the actual HD is smaller than the advertised number is because some bits are reserved for sector information and thing of the like depending on the OS that’s used.

This is my take on thing. Please let me know what you think, so that we can update this article if required.
:No, the text in the article is correct, if a bit innaccurate on a technicality.  The issue here is actually the binary PREFIX versus the metric prefix.  This is largely historical; when this first became an issue there were no binary prefixes, so 2^10 bytes was called a kilobyte since 1024 (2^10) is close enough to 1000 (10^3).  However, the problem becomes more noticible when you get into the multiple gigabyte range.  Most OSes report a GB as what is now called a GiB, or Gibibyte; 2^30 bytes.  Hard drive manufacturers continue to use the metric definition of a GB: 10^9, which is obviously less than the binary Gibibyte, because it makes it seem like the drive has a higher capacity than it actually does.

:The blocбks used for partition and file system accounting information rarely occupy more than a few KiB, and is utterly insignificant when talking about discrepencies of tens of Gibibytes.  I'll edit this section of the article to be a little more clear. -- [[User:Uberpenguin|uberpenguin]] 15:16, 2005 Apr 4 (UTC)

== perpendicular recording ==

Does anybody have a more detailed description of what perpendicular recording is? I checked over at [[Valdemar Poulsen]] page and i couldn't find anything about his discovery as this paragraph from the linked article asserts. "Perpendicular recording was pioneered by the late 19th century work of Danish scientist Valdemar Poulsen, who demonstrated magnetic recording with his telegraphone." [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4411649.stm]

Here is a pretty down to earth explanation of Perpendicular recording.
[http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/]

== Altitude Sensor? ==

"Some modern drives include flying height sensors to detect if the pressure is too low, and temperature sensors to alert the system to overheating problems."

I do not believe that as of today, April 2005, there are any hard drives that have an altitude sensor as these are still to costly. Every modern drive has a temperature sensor. Channel parameters are typically adapted to the measured temperature. [[User:BruceSchardt|BruceSchardt]]

An altitude sensor is not necessary to detect flyheight change&mdash;there are other methods of doing so.  Of course, the statement above is somewhat misleading.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 15:31, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Start Stop CSS Testing ==

I changed the discussion of startstop or CSS testing because the statement that 50% of the drives fail at 50,000 cycles is not correct. Typical specification for a desktop harddrive is 50,000 cycles. However this is not a mean time (cycles) till failure specification. This is a specification that all drives are supposed to achieve without failure. In typical testing a population of several hundred drives are contact-start-stop (CSS) tested for >100,000 cycles. No failures caused by the head-disk interface are allowed at less then 50,000 cycles. Testing for more then 50,000 cycles insures that the HDI design has margin. In proof, the Maxtor Diamondmax 10 hardrive specifies Start-Stop cycles at >50,000 min.[http://www.maxtor.com/_files/maxtor/en_us/documentation/data_sheets/diamondmax_10_data_sheet.pdf] Notebook hard drives are all load-unload designs that never park the heads on the disk, instead the heads are unloaded onto a ramp. This is done to increase the magnitude of non-operational shock that the drive can withstand.
[[User:BruceSchardt|BruceSchardt]]  RESEARCHER:John Raineil Bayani

----
The article currently says
: Most manufacturers design the sliders to survive 50,000 contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above 50%. ... the Maxtor DiamondMax series of desktop hard drives are rated to 50,000 start-stop cycles. This means that no failures attributed to the head-disk interface were seen before at least 50,000 start-stop cycles during testing.

This makes it sound like Maxtor uses a different, more stringent test, and that their hard drives (or at least the sliders) are more reliable than "most manufacturers".
Is that really true?
I wish I had a reference that explained what is really meant by "at least 50 000". Does it mean that after 50 000 cycles, at least half the drives still worked? Or does it mean that after 50 000 cycles, *all* the drives still worked?

:Do not [[degauss]] your hard drive. --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 18:29, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:Well, that's not entirely true.  HDDs made for portable CE devices typically have a shock sensor or drop sensor that allows the firmware to detect if the device has been jostled or chucked toward the ground at high velocity.  The firmware then unloads the heads.  (On the other hand, what happens after the drive bounces off the ground is an entirely separate concern!)  Furthermore, portable music players usually buffer data in memory and then unload the heads so as to minimize the risk when the people in those iPod "silhouette" commercials do their shimmy.  Of course HDIs are caused by other mechanisms as well, such as particulate contamination hitting the head or from deformation of the ABS during start-stop.  Hey, no technology's perfect, especially in the volumes HDDs are produced in.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 18:05, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== Noisy Chatter ==

Can anyone here add to the page why EXACTLY do hard drives make the sound that they do when transferring data?

:The EXACT reason is because various things inside the drive are moving around.  --[[User:Brouhaha|Brouhaha]] 08:52, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:The noise comes from seek operations where the VCM moves the head over the track containing the information to be read or written.  When one track is read/written, the head must be positioned at the next track, and so on.  Depending on the areal density and radius, the number of sectors per track differ, but the range is generally 300-1200, well under a megabyte per track.  If one expects the HDD to have a transfer rate of hundreds of megabytes per second, the actuator will be moving frequently, as the head jumps from track to track at the rate of hundreds of operations per second.  (Of course interface transfer rates are an upper bound and differ from the media transfer rate, which also varies by the above factors.)  Actuator movement on modern HDDs is minimized by switching heads up/down the head stack first, then seeking to the adjacent track.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 17:55, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

::Minor clarification and addition to my previous comment.  Since the movement of the actuator happens hundreds of times per second, the mechanical vibration is modulated in the audible frequency band, i.e. hundreds of Hertz, and can thus be heard.

::There are three methods used to handle physical-to-LBA mapping.  One is to use one surface entirely, then switch to another surface, but this isn't used on any modern drive that I know of.  Another is to go from one side of the disk to the other (usually outer-diameter to inner-diameter), alternating surfaces before moving to the next track.  Last is a hybrid between the previous two, moving across one surface in a zone or sub-zone area before switching surfaces.  The latter method has many different variations, whose merits depend greatly on the servo characteristics and usage application of the device.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 07:57, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

== Hard disk != Hard disk drive ==

Hard disk == the spinning CD-like thingy
Hard disk drive == the hardware that reads and writes to the hard disk

just thought I'd point it out :)

:Semantics, semantics =)  The old IBM Storage Tech term for HDDs is "file".  Veteran engineers still use the term, but newer engineers just say "drives".  "HDD" is too unwieldy.  (I suppose I'm a bit surprised that no one from Seagate has adjusted the spellng of "hard disk" to be "hard disc", which they seem to prefer.)

:HDD media isn't really CD-like, since the substrate is aluminum or glass and not polycarbonate plastic.  Nor does it exhibit the interference spectrum, as there are no pits and lands; an HDD platter actually looks like a mirror because of its exteme flatness and plated magnetic surface.  One of my coworkers keeps a 2.5" disk on his desk propped up by one of those binder clips (black metal spring clip with chrome latches) for preening =)

:I do agree, though, that this article should be called "Hard disk drive" rather than "Hard disk", as that's technically more correct.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 16:52, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

I removed the sentence and the section regarding derivative technologies.  The sentence was poorly written and confusing.  That could be fixed, though.

If it's true that floppy disks and CD-ROMs are derivatives of hard disk technology then this fact certainly needs to be mentioned - with supporting references.  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:39, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

== Other characteristics ==

I edited Physical Size and it became a huge blob of text.  Perhaps I should've bulletized each form factor.

It seems odd under MTBF to put that SATA supports 10k RPM and FC supports 15k RPM.  These things aren't directly related.  While spindle speed does affect BPI and thus the data rate selected for a given zone, one could just as well have a 10k RPM PATA drive.  MTBF itself is a very difficult topic.

Perhaps it would be useful to glean all the parameters generally published in datasheets, so each one can be explained for the reader.

==Virtual Byte vs Factual Byte==
How come they measure hard drives in false byte computations? For example, they conclude 1000KB as being 1MB when in fact 1024 KB is 1MB, is this just a way to rip people off for more money on less bytes, or are they too lazy to use the factual bytes? I don't understand, thanks!
:Here we go again... See [[Megabyte]] and [[Mibibyte]]. Technically, 1MB (megabytes) should be 1000 kilobytes. Then, 1MiB (Mibibyte) should be 1024 Kibibytes. [[User:Last Avenue|--Last Avenue]] 23:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
:The problem here is, this runs counter to the normal HDD naming scheme. Originally, someone proposed 1MB being 1024 and 1MiB being 1000, but that just added to the confusion. [[User:Last Avenue|--Last Avenue]] 23:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

::Actually, originally someone suggested using the SI-prefix "kilo" (10<sup>3</sup>) to indicate 1024 bytes, since 1000 is "close enough" to 1024.  At the time there were no IEC binary prefixes to properly describe powers-of-two byte capacities, so the convention just stuck and became more notable as larger prefixes were used to describe incorrect byte capacities.  This of course led to the dual meanings of some of the SI prefixes in computerland and the opportunity for storage device manufacturers to capitalize on the confusion and make their drives seem more spacious to the lay man (who probably doesn't care about all this mess anyway).  The article already covers this information, though. -- [[User:Uberpenguin|uberpenguin]] 16:38, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

:Here is my point of view, as someone with a Microelectronic Engineering background. I don't buy that historically, it was just because there was little discrepancy between base-2 and base-10 multiples in capacity ratings. I think that also, historically, the only data capacity where it makes sense to measure in base-2 multiples, was (and still is) RAM, when you're talking about row/column based binary addressing.  [[User:59.167.116.194|59.167.116.194]] 16:03, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

:So from an engineering point of view it does NOT make sense to measure a hard disk in base-2 multiples, because an engineer will want to know the true number of sectors*bytes. This is because the natural, intrinsically sequential nature of that storage medium is NOTHING LIKE addressing RAM - it literally is just a big stream of bits. Likewise with serial communications specifications - it makes NO LESS SENSE to count the number of bits coming out in base-10, than it does to do so in base-2 multiples that software-types seem to cling to so much... in fact from an engineering point of view base-2 multiples would be very annoying (there are many interesting calculations that can be done with base-10 multiple specs, but base-2 multiples distort the true number of "symbols" we're trying specify and have to be converted back to base-10 multiples every time!) Anyway, my point is that although I can understand the exasperation of typical end-users, it's not a conspiracy motivated by evil ;-) [[User:59.167.116.194|59.167.116.194]] 16:03, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

::Here's my point of view, as someone with a semiconductor device engineering background.  I do believe the classical history because early operating systems tended to use multipliers of powers of two to incorrectly define SI prefixes.  This was before hard disks, so memory capacities DID refer to RAM of some sort (core or the like).  When hard disks came along (a good while after we had operating systems and RAM) it was simple to keep using the same multipliers.  Nobody claimed it was a conspiracy, it was just an early convenience that has become an annoyance as storage capacities and the percentage error increase.  Incidentally, how does using a different radix "distort the true number of symbols"?  Radix shouldn't confuse anybody who can do simple arithmetic. -- [[User:Matt Britt|mattb]] <code>@ 2006-09-02&nbsp;16:14Z</code>

Those who do not know history are condemned to mis-interpret it.
**The first hard disk drive, the IBM RAMAC (1956) had 5,000,000 six-bit characters - '''decidedly not binary.'''
**IBM soon adopted their Count Key Data (CKD) track format for their disk drives.  In this '''format''' a sector (called record in IBM parlance) could be any size from one byte up to the maximum track length - '''again decidedly not binary'''.  IBM specified a '''formatted''' media capacity based upon a sector of maximum track length, which varied from subsystem to subsystem but '''in all cases was not binary''', see [http://sdisw.com/vm/dasd_capacity.html IBM Mainframe Disk Capacity].
**A popular IBM CKD disk drive record size was 800 bytes representing 10 80-column cards - '''decidedly not binary.'''
**The '''unformatted''' capacity of IBM media was known within the art but not publicized.  For example, the IBM 3336 disk pack for the IBM 3330 disk drive was generally known as a 100 Megabyte disk pack because it had 100,018,280 bytes available to an IBM operating system with full track records.  The unformatted capacity was 104,952,960 bytes.- '''decidedly not binary and a proper use of decimal prefixes.'''
**The same 3336 disk pack when formatted for a Digital system had a formatted capacity of about 70 megabytes but was still called a 100-megabyte disk pack because of IBM's market power.
**As unique media and drives were introduced by suppliers other than IBM they began the practice of specifying the products in '''unformatted''' capacities using decimal prefixes.  See for example the CDC SMD HDD product line or the Shugart 5.25" FDD.  The system or subsystem manufacturer advertised and/or reported the formatted capacity - NOT the disk drive or media manufacturer – because formatted capacity is a function of their controllers!  Decimal prefixes continued to be used by drive and media manufacturers because it made no sense to use binary - we have 10 fingers and there is nothing binary about the unformatted capacities.
**Also note that systems and system programmers generally do NOT use prefixes, binary or decimal.  At least I know of no compiler or assembler or low level OS call that uses or reports with prefixes - you get a string which is usually hexadecimal but can be decimal, octal or binary but never (to my knowledge) with prefixes (or for that matter comma's).
**The first misrepresentation by a systems house may be Digital who appears to have reported and advertised the formatted capacity 5.25" DSDD FDD in kibibytes misrepresented as kilobytes.  Apple and Microsoft rapidly followed this for 5.25" FDD's.  The DSHD 3.5" FDD is a 2.0 megabyte unformatted product; todate I haven't figured out who came up with the universal and incorrect 1.44 MB designation which we all know to be 2 * 720 kibibytes (double capacity DSDD).
**It appears that Microsoft accurately reported HDD's in DOS but fell from grace in Windows.  In most DOS's that I looked at, Microsoft reported capacity as a decimal string with no prefixes (therefore no misrepresentation) but then incorrectly adopted prefixes in the graphical Windows environment.
**This got further confused as the industry migrated from dumb device level interfaces to intelligent interfaces.  For example, drives with the “dumb” ST506/ST412 interface were specified with unformatted capacity. No one was surprised when the 12.76 megabyte unformatted ST412 sold by Seagate became a 10.0 megabyte formatted PC/XT HDD - '''and both had the correct prefix usage'''.  Intelligent interfaces such as IDE and SCSI hide the unformatted capacity so drive manufacturers continued there practice of using decimal units and prefixes.  
A long rant, but it is pretty clear, at least to me, that the HDD companies have been historically consistent and reasonable in their usage of decimal prefixes and that the confusion and misapplication of binary prefixes comes from some careless translations by systems and subsystems manufacturers.[[User:216.103.87.80|216.103.87.80]] 00:33, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

:While I agree with what you say, binary prefixes can sometimes make sense, for things like cluster sizes... but OTOH, most users should never really have to deal with binary prefixes, and kB should mean 1000 bytes as far as they are concerned.  I would argue that when you need to measure a quantity such as the length of a file, you should do it with decimal prefixes, i.e. divide by powers of 1000. The only time you should use kibibytes/mebibytes/gibibytes is when it allows better accuracy (for instance when dealing with quantities of RAM, where 512 MiB is most likely the exact amount). --[[User:StuartBrady|StuartBrady]] ([[User talk:StuartBrady|Talk]]) 01:06, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

== Fastest Location on Drive? ==

[[User:71.112.224.112|71.112.224.112]] 23:28, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
:The beginning would be fastest, since pretty much all hard disks use zoned recording now, which makes the outer tracks operate at a higher bitrate than the inner ones. Seek times would still be about the same unless you get a drive with a fast spindle. Also, if you're swapping a lot and your computer can handle it, ''add more memory''!

== 137gb barrier ==
There's very little detail on this. I think it should be a little more technical (48bit something?) and give the next barrier.

:That's really more a drive controller/interface issue than a physical hard disk issue. -- [[User:Uberpenguin|uberpenguin]] 18:07, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

:Starting from the ATA-3 standard, up through the ATA-5 standard, the LBA address was specified as a 28-bit quantity.  This means that pow( 2, 28 ) * 512 bytes = 137 438 953 472 bytes (about 137 GB) is addressable with the older commands.  ATA-6 provided extensions to the command set that allow 48-bit LBA addressing, e.g. pow( 2, 48 ) * 512 bytes = 1.441 151 880 759e+17 bytes (about 144 PB).  This will be sufficient for some time to come.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 14:45, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

:The "barrier" is another BIOS-based limit rather than a hardware-based one; you could do 48-bit LBA on a 386 with an ISA paddleboard in if you were willing to live with the speed. The other issue is that some PCI IDE controllers (mainly from the late 1990s, in the early days of UDMA) either can't handle 48-bit LBA at all, or can't use 48-bit LBA with DMA on (which means the performance would suck). As I understand it (from looking at the Linux and FreeBSD driver sources), Intel's and VIA's controllers are immune to this and handle 48-bit LBA just fine, no matter how old they are.

== parallel reading on platters/tracks ==

Are there any mechanisms for reading multiple tracks/regions in parallel? Or maybe something as simple as reading a whole line from a drum etc?

:Currently there is no method for doing so.  First, all heads are affixed to the same armature, so in order to read multiple tracks that aren't at the same radius, one would need multiple armatures.  To do so would require multiple VCMs to drive the armature, which poses multiple problems, namely where to stick an additional large permanent magnets required, how to handle the extra current demands, and how to servo on multiple surfaces at once.  Typically there is only one servo path, and only one servo processor.  Also, the heads are multiplexed by means of the preamplifier electronics, so if multiple read paths were desired, multiple preamps would be required.  (Note that there is typically a so-called "gang write" function in the preamp to write the same pattern on all the heads simultaneously.  This is only meaningful for writing the servo pattern to the disk, however.)

:Second, current HDD signal processing techniques require a lot of sophisticated processing in the data channel.  Having multiple read paths would mean not just multiple preamps, but multiple channels to encode/decode the data, and multiple paths in the controller to handle ECC processing and storing simultaneous streams of data.  In general, this is not very practical.  It's far simpler to just get a bunch of disks in a striped RAID configuration to speed up access.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 01:32, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

== Fujitsu and Class/Form-Factor ==

Edited the bit about Fujitsu "exiting the mass market".  Depending on one's perspective one might consider everything but server-class to be the mass market.  Anyway, Fujitsu's 2.5" mobile and 3.5" server HDDs are currently obtainable in both the U.S. and Japan.  Here's the [http://www.fujitsu.com/us/fcpa/news/pr/20010801-01.html Fujitsu press release] regarding their exit from the desktop market.

One more thing, someone should probably standardize the way the form factors are referred to within the article.  There's for example 2.5 inch, 2.5-inch, 2.5", notebook, etc. to choose from.  My personal opinion is that the class and form factor should be stated, e.g. Mobile 2.5", Server 3.5", and so forth.  Thoughts?  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 15:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the fix.  (I'm still something of a wiki newbie.)  The Server 2.5" is indeed newer.  If I'm not mistaken, "near-line" usually refers to always available storage, as opposed to tape storage, which requires retrieval from an archive and is much slower.

Internally, we call this "entry-level server", but who knows what the marketing guys tell people. *wink* [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 07:42, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

Comments about the following categories/classes?
* Server 3.5"
* Server 2.5"
* Desktop 3.5"
* Mobile 2.5"
* Mobile 1.8"
* CE 1.0"
* CE 0.85"

Not sure where to put "entry-level server", but since design- and reliability-wise it's closer to Desktop than to Server, I'd prefer to leave it in the former.

Mobile 2.5" comes in various spindle speeds, and the high end 7200 RPM files come close to Desktop.  Perhaps eventually 2.5" 7200 RPM will be referred to as Desktop 2.5".  Mobile 2.5" at 4200 RPM is a dying design point, so that category would be left with 5400 RPM.

== Magnetic Surface ==

Hi there, I added 3 paragraphs in the 'mechanics' section about how the magnetic surface works. (my first wikipedia contribution!) I am no expert on this subject, please check it. It might have more to do with magnetic recording in general, or maybe with read heads, than hard disks
[[User:BlankAxolotl|BlankAxolotl]] 07:20, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:Good for a first entry.  Nice pictures!  That was indeed what I'd been taught about the usage of grains in magnetic media.  However, each grain is not a single magnetic domain...yet.  Right now, each magnet is multiple grains.  One future advance in HDDs is what's called "patterned media" where each grain is capable of being individually magnetized.

:Regarding organization of this article, it seems to me that all the magnetics stuff doesn't belong under mechanics.  Of course you put your addition there because the rest of the material was there, which fits.  "Mechanics" seems to imply the aspects mechanical engineers would deal with, i.e. the base casting, spindle, hub, spacers, breather filter, actuator, gimbal assembly, etc.  "Magnetic Recording" would better encompass the physics, material science, and electrical engineering aspects of HDDs, I think.  Perhaps when all the contributors to this article decide it's time for a rewrite we can break things down logically.

:One thing I should mention: The read head is no longer an inductor, although the write head is.  Modern read heads, using (CIP-)GMR or the newer Tunneling MR (variously abbreviated "TMR", ambiguous with "Track Misregistration", or "TuMR"), are not classified as inductive heads as there is no coil present.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 08:26, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the feedback. Notes:

::I was under the impression that modern grains really were single domains (though I admit my memory is a bit fuzzy.. and I don't have my references with me). The magnetic regions, of course, are made up of hundreds of grains. Though, I just checked your talk page, and you are a real HDD engineer, unlike me :) . At any rate, in all the theoretical calculations I saw, grains are approximated as single domains. I have not really looked into patterned media, but from what I remember the idea is to make really big single-domain grains, and the magnetic regions will be composed of a single grain.

== Encoding? ==

These two sentences confuse me when compared with the diagram:
:If the magnetization reverses between two magnetic domains, this signifies one state, while no change in magnetization signifies the other state. For various reasons, the actual binary data is encoded using sequences of these two possible states, rather than the states themselves.

This ASCII-art elucidates, N = no reversal, R = magnetic field reversal:

      magnetic regions ...  head travels this way ===>
      v         v         v
 | --> --> | --> --> | <-- <-- | <-- <-- | <-- <-- | --> --> |
 | --> --> | --> --> | <-- <-- | <-- <-- | <-- <-- | --> --> |
 States:   N         R         N         N         R
 Binary:   0         1         0         0         1

I read the two states as "no reversal" and "reversal", and so the diagram shows binary data *is* encoded as the states themselves. Ie. N is 0 and R is 1.

After reading [http://www.storagereview.com/guide2000/ref/hdd/geom/dataFM.html Storage Review's Frequency Modulation (FM)]
this article's diagram appears over simplified, and I suspect it omits the modulation stage.

I suggest the diagram should show frequency modulation (in itself a now obsolete simplification) encoding like this:

 | --> --> | <-- <-- | <-- <-- | --> --> | <-- <-- 
 | --> --> | <-- <-- | <-- <-- | --> --> | <-- <-- 
 States:   R         N         R         R
 Encoding:     0                    1
 Binary:       0                    1

The sequence of states RN encodes to binary data 0 while the sequence RR encodes to 1.
The sequence NN is forbidden to prevent a long stretch of no reversals causing the read controller to lose track of where the region boundaries are.
More complicated encoding schemes are described in [[Run Length Limited]] and 
[http://www.storagereview.com/guide2000/ref/hdd/geom/dataRLL.html RLL diagrammed].

Lastly I would try to improve the last sentence to read:
For various reasons, the actual binary data is encoded using consecutive sequences of these two possible states, rather than the states themselves.

Regarding encoding on HDDs in general, RLL parameters have relaxed quite a bit.  Most modern codes are highly efficient, i.e. 60/62, not having many of the constraints that were previously required.  This means that the read channel has to deal with quite a bit more stress in clock recovery.  There is typically no constraint on the minimum bit run length (0s between 1s), i.e. d=0.  The k parameter, maximum bit run length (0s between 1s), typically is very large.  Sometimes another parameter is used to specify the maximum run length of 1s between 0s, but these are more often than not the same.

Frequently transition constraints are achieved by making use of the parity bits.  For example, if there are a bunch of 0s in a row, parity would end up being 1 (odd parity or similar); by evenly spacing the parity throughout the frame, optimal transition constraints can be achieved.  (60/62 would have around j/k around 30.)  Combining an MTR coding with parity can also be effective.

Earlier coding methods like FM and MFM had the advantage of reducing the flux change frequency.  On highly efficient codes, the flux change frequency is equal to the channel data rate, which is in turn very close to the user data rate.

Lastly: NRZ versus NRZI.  In NRZ, the binary data refers to the absolute state of the write current, i.e. "0" means one direction (say, -1 or S), "1" means the other (say, +1 or N).  In NRZI, "0" means no transition, "1" means transition.  The above diagram shows NRZI.  NRZ and NRZI are related in that NRZI is the derivative (as in calculus) of NRZ.  Also, the length of equivalent NRZ and NRZI data is such that NRZI is shorter by one, as NRZI sits on transitions between states, whereas NRZ is the state.  (Analogy with a fork: NRZ is the tines, NRZI is the gaps between the tines.)
[[User:Gmw|GMW]] 09:07, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

::Wow! The encoding stuff seems like it should go in the [[Run Length Limited]] article.

::About NRZ vs NRZI: From my physical intuition, I thought that read heads ONLY read in NRZI: Both the inductor and GMR heads can only detect flux changes reliably. Read heads cannot detect magnetization direction because the fields are too weak, and I think (?) detecting overall magnetic fields is hard in these small spaces (a hall probe or gaussmeter would be needed..). However, I can see that one could easily add a tiny circuit, which uses some sort of parity counter to convert the NRZI to NRZ. Thus any NRZ reading you get must (according to me) always be an interpolation based on the raw NRZI data the read head gives. To the circuitry engineer, though, they are equivalent. Right, wrong?

== 750 GB Hard Drive ==

I added in to the timeline the creation of the new Seagate 750 GB Hard Drive.  While I don't know if it would be necessary to note every jump in capacity, I think the fact that capacity leapt 50% in a period of 7 or 8 months due to the introduction of perpendicular recording seems noteworthy.

I agree, though perhaps you should add in parentheses that it was perpendicular recording which made it possible (I do realize it mentions it as an achievement right above, but still).

== "....platters spin at a constant RPM...", later "...electronics control.. rotation of the disk" ==

I think something is not quite coherent here.
First "....platters spin at a constant RPM...",
but later "...electronics control.. rotation of the disk".

AFAIK, platters spin at a constant RPM, electronics can only stop it.
The phrase "...ectronics control.. rotation of the disk" leds to small misunderstanding.
Some persons think, that different platters can revolve at different speed.

What do you think?

: The ideal situation is that the platters spin at exactly constant RPM.  However, that is not the case.  There are actually two servo mechanisms in HDDs, one being the actuator servo, and the second being the spindle servo.  Consider: How can one spin a disk at a fixed frequency, and how would you be sure it was rotating at the desired angular velocity?  The crude answer is that the spindle servo control code measures the instantaneous speed of the disk and tweaks the motor torque accordingly.  The result is constant slight adjustments, and since no servo mechanism is perfect, there is slight variation in the RPM.  This "spindle jitter" is a parameter (mechanical tolerance) used to leave engineering margin in the track format's gate timings.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 15:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

Drives that have been run hard for most of their lifetime (like SCSI drives in a busy array) are often lucky to last 3 years -- between the high rotational speeds and the vibration of N other drives in the same chassis (and also from seeking, especially on the older drives with much heavier actuators), the bearings will eventually grind themselves into dust. (This is the other reason why people are moving to fluid dynamic bearings; just like the bearings in a car engine, they last pretty much forever as long as the oil is clean.)

==5.25 inch drive ==

Why is it that all hard drives nowadays are 3.5 inches. Why doesn't someone make one that's 5 inches to fit in an external drive bay of the computers? By my calculations that would give you over 2 times the area on the platters and thus two times the GB. I know it would be slower but this would be great for an archival drive, backup drive or large file storage drive.--'''[[User:God_of_War|God]] <FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">Ω</font> [[User Talk:God_of_War| War]]''' 22:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
: I had a 5.25 drive, the Bigfoot 8GB, that I bought in the good old days of 1998. That beast was SLOOOWWW. I think you have a good point regarding using it for archiving. Part of the reason may be the intense competition between manufacturers (no time to waste on stuff outside the mainstream) and the fact that drives are doubling in size every 12-18 months. They tried 5.25 inch drives at one point and now they dont make them so there must be a reason. -[[User:Ravedave|Ravedave]] 22:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
::After the first 100GB the only thing most people use hard drives for is media. For a media center pc, you don't need a seek time under 10ms. That a hundredth of a second! I know OS and programs are constantly using the hard drive, so this would proably work best if you had a 100 gig hard drive for the OS and applications and a 2 terabyte drive for file storage. 2 Terabytes is completely possible with current technology if hard drive space actually doubles with area.--'''[[User:God_of_War|God]] <FONT FACE="Book Antiqua">Ω</font> [[User Talk:God_of_War| War]]''' 22:49, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
:::Quantum did indeed try this, and the people who really went for it were white-box dealers and OEMs like Compaq. Thing is, they made it a little ''too'' cheap; the original Bigfoot was only 3600 RPM, at a time when 4500 and 5400 RPM drives were common and 7200 was just breaking into the IDE world. Even with a super-high capacity, people are going to complain if it's too slow, and complain they did; Quantum ended up selling Bigfoots at bargain-basement prices to OEMs that didn't give a damn (I'm looking at you, Compaq). As for why it hasn't been revisited, well, it's a combination of economics (3.5" drives are dirt cheap these days and every decent OS will let you do at least striping) and engineering (not even Seagate was able to make a 7200 RPM 5.25" drive, though I suppose it could be done now with FDB motors). That and a bigger drive costs more to build, generates more heat and uses more energy to turn the motors -- and with PCs hot enough as it is, I'm sure the OEMs wouldn't like that. It'd end up being a niche product for which you'd pay boutique prices, and there are more practical ways of doing the same thing (2.5" drives in a 5.25" bay RAID case, maybe).

==Criticism of speed==
Shouldn't the article contain a criticism section about the fact that hard disk speed is a big throttle in overall computer performance and that no good replacement has been developed?

[[User:BMW Z3|BMW Z3]] 12:49, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe, but hard disks are fast enough now that they aren't nearly as bad as they used to be...and cheap enough that if you need more speed, you can just RAID them together. What sort of alternative did you have in mind? [[User:Lee Cremeans|-lee]] 04:22, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

::I don't see how that's a "criticism"; it's just the result of economics.  We want massive amounts of storage but generally cannot afford for that storage to take its form as faster semiconductor memory.  Hard drives provide cheap mass storage at the cost of speed, but this is generally an acceptable trade off due to various optimizations and tricks in modern VFS layers.  You could obtain 100 GB of flash memory or DRAM, but it would be cost prohibitive and bulky and there aren't many reasons you would need the lower latency and higher throughput of solid state memory in a mass storage capacity.  -- [[User:Uberpenguin|uberpenguin]] <code>@ 2006-08-06&nbsp;15:18Z</code>

== Non-linear increase in chance of damage? ==

Around paragraph 11 or 13 under "Mechanics and magnetics" reads:
"In CSS drives the sliders carrying the head sensors (often also just called heads) are designed to reliably survive a number of landings and takeoffs from the disk surface, though wear and tear on these microscopic components eventually takes its toll. Most manufacturers design the sliders to survive 50,000 contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above 50%. However, '''''the decay rate is not linear'''''—when a drive is younger and has fewer start-stop cycles, it has a better chance of surviving the next startup than an older, higher-mileage drive (as the head literally drags along the drive's surface until the air bearing is established). For example, the Maxtor DiamondMax series of desktop hard drives are rated to 50,000 start-stop cycles. This means that no failures attributed to the head-disk interface were seen before at least 50,000 start-stop cycles during testing." [bold italics added]
It seems to me that while it may well be true that the increase is not linear, the explanation given does not show it to be - only that it increases. Anybody know? Or am I misreading?

== Why is it called "C:\" Drive? ==

Is there any historical reason why the hard drive of a computer is called the "C" drive? I used to think that since it is the primary drive on many hardware and software configurations it would get the "A" name, but it got stuck with "C". Even the keyword "C Drive" redirects to this article. Maybe somebody knows? 

Also why I have never seen a "B" drive? I'm sure there are people who set it up to have a "B" drive but this is not the default setting on many computers?

== More work for the editors ==
Sorry if I'm piling on more work for you guys, but I think there needs to be a section that addresses current technologies and another one for future directions. For current technologies, I'd like to see a little blurb on perpendicular recording, the SATA interface, and maybe current limitations. For future directions, maybe a link to holographic storage, and other theoretical ways to overcome physical or quantum limitations.

And something I can't seem to find the answer for: Why were the 10K rpm drives limited to 36GB and 74GB for a while now? Almost similar to their SCSI cousins. I think the only breakthrough was from Western Digital with their 150Gig 10k-rpm drive -- which is far below the capacity on 7200rpm drives. Perhaps another physical limitation? Isn't there a fear of the platters flying apart at a certain rotational velocity?

== Problems with the recent re-organisation ==

I have to say that I don't think the technology section is as readable as it was two days ago. The sub-headings are too short, it goes to some unnecessary lengths to clarify things and it contains an unneeded "advantages" header which should either be implicit in the text or explicitly balanced with a counter-header to read properly.

::: Just some random comments on my cursory read of the article (sorry if this is the wrong place for my comments). (a) The article states that "Modern disks can perform around 50 random access or 100 Sequential access operations per second.". This is innacurate. In the case of random I/O. the number of IOPS is mostly limited by seek and rotational latency combined. For example, on some disks you can have 250 random reads per sec with a 4 ms seek + random latency on average. On sequential I/O - ordered sequential writes are actually batched & optimized by the controller (or other elements in the storage stack) as larger operations, so the number of seq. operations is not really meaningful. (b) The article states that FC-AL is the cornerstone of storage area networks. FC-AL is actually obsolete and replaced with switched fabric (FC-SW).

== Is my hard drive defying physics? ==

Hard drives act as [[gyroscope]]s. They can be pretty strong ones-- my 7200 rpm exterior hard drive offers significant resistance when I try to move it while it's on. According to common sense, and to the basic laws of physices, for the hard disk/gyroscope to exert a force that I have to spend energy to overcome, the hard drive will have to spend energy. So, my question is: if, when I turn the hard drive, it spends energy on resisting my force, wouldn't that slow the disk down? And, wouldn't a small decrease in speed screw up any data that is being read or written at the time? I've moved the disk around while transfering data to it, and the data came out fine. How? Am I misunderstanding something, or is my hard drive choosing to ignore physics? [[User:Twilight Realm|Twilight Realm]] 19:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

:The platter speed is controlled by a servo mechanism, so whilst twisting the drive would slow the drive slightly for various reasons, the servo mechanism will just adjust the torque and keep it within the specified speed range that the drive head can succesfully accept and decode. Thus any extra energy needed comes from the powersupply.[[User:Wolfkeeper|WolfKeeper]] 19:39, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

::You're doing all the work! Gyroscopes don't spend kinetic energy producing their effects because they don't actually "create" any forces; rather, they redirect external forces. When you put a force on the disk in one axis, it reacts by trying to precess (move) in another axis 90° away from the imposed force. So you're not only applying the initial force, you're also resisting the precessional force. Or your cables would get very twisted very fast.

::You can see this with a toy gyroscope or the gyroscope demo at the [[Exploratorium]]. No matter what you do to move the gyroscope, it doesn't slow down noticeably. (Well, except for the additional friction loads the you impose on the gyroscope's bearings.)

::[[User:Atlant|Atlant]] 19:45, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

:Gyroscopic forces in the ideal case do no work.  If (without loss of generality) the hard drive spin axis is up and you apply a torque about the east/west axis, then the hard drive's response is to twist about the north/south axis, at right angles to the direction you torqued it.  Work is the [[dot product]] of the applied [[force]] and motion, or of the applied torque and twist.  Since the motion is at right angles to the force, the dot product is zero.

== lifetime ==

How long does a typical drive last?
What can I do to extend the useful lifetime of a hard drive?

The "MTBF levels up to 1 million hours" is misleading without further explanation.

An old year 2000 FAQ mentions:

: "If I purchase a drive with an MTBF of 1,000,000 hours (114 years), can I expect the drive will operate without failure for 1,000,000 hours?"

: "No, because the drive will reach end-of-life before reaching 1,000,000 hours. For example, a continuously operated drive with a five-year useful life will reach end-of-life in less than 45,000 hours. But, theoretically, if the drive is replaced with a new drive when it reaches end-of-life, and the new drive is replaced with another new drive when it reaches end-of-life, etc., then the probability that 1,000,000 hours would elapse before a failure occurs would be greater than 30 percent in most cases."

Is that still true today (in 2006)? If so, it seems to indicate that "end-of-life"/"useful life" (currently neglected in this article) is far more important than "MTBF".

The [[Hard disk]] article currently claims that "While the disk is spinning, the heads are supported by an air bearing and experience no physical contact or wear."

To maximize disk lifetime, should I leave my computer turned "on" 24/7, and make sure my screen saver is set to "never" turn off the hard drives ?

--[[User:70.177.117.132|70.177.117.132]] 06:20, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

:Drives are rated for a certain number of "touchdowns" across their life, and drives meant for frequent start-stop operation (in laptops, iPods, etc.) tend to be rated for many more touchdowns than drives meant for operation in a big server farm. On the other hand, the spindle bearings wear continuously as the drive spins, so there's a tradeoff between the life limitations caused by the heads touching down and the life limitations caused by the spindle bearings constanty wearing. Check the specs for your particular drive for the exact numbers.

== why are all cylinders the same size ==

I am a memeber of a Google group named "Sun Solaris Helpdesk 24x7" and the following question was posted:

''hi,i didn't really get what my tutor told about the cyinders.my 
question is,if sectors are the smallest part of the memory(512 
bytes),and many tracks of sectors of form a cylinder,then how clould 
the size of the cylinder be 1.99 mb. It <http://mb.it/> should vary on each 
track.can 
anyone explain me please.'' 

I attempted to answer it, thus:             

''If you are thinking in terms of the physical size of the cylinders, 
then yes, they get physically larger (measured in linear terms such as 
miilimeters or inches) as they get further from the spindle. However, 
if you measure the cylinders in RADIAL terms (degrees or radians) then 
they are all the "same size." Likewise (obviously) for the spin rate: 
the outer cylinders turn much faster (measured in mm/sec or miles/hour 
or any other linear units you like) but all cylinders turn the same 
number of RPMs. 

So, since the sector reads and sector writes are controlled by TIME 
rather than distance, the sectors near the spindle are physically 
shorter than those further from the spindle. Nevertheless, each sector 
subtends the same angle and each sector takes the same amount of time 
to read or write. 


This means that the sectors near the spindle are the ones with the 
highest areal bit densities while those further from the spindle have 
lower areal bit densities. This sounds as if there is "wasted space" in 
the outer (lower density) sectors, but since the read operation (and I 
guess the write operation in some sense) is a time-based integrator, 
the amount of integration time is exactly the same for all sectors.'' 

''P.S. I was unable to surf to your link <http://mb.it> -- if you really 
want the group to see it, you need to fix it somehow.'' 
             
This apparently was not clear enough, resulting in this follow-up question:      

''its really nice to hear from you,thank you for your kind 
reply.but still im not clear that how the cylinders are exatly formed (i.e) are 
the cylinders near the spindle of the same same size as the cylinders in the 
outer track have (1.99 mb)? if so how ?don't the size differ according to 
the size of the track?if u could help me ?thanks in advance.'' 

So, I tried again, and the following seems to have satified the questioner:

'' All the cylinders on a disk are the same "size" in terms of bytes stored. If the inner cylinders hold 1.99 Mbytes each, then the outer cylinders hold 1.99 MBytes each. The reason for this is that each one is the same "size" when measured in terms of time. Years ago "all" disks turned at 3600 RPM, so let's work with that number even though these days many disks turn at 7200 RPM (or perhaps higher). An inner cylinder takes 1/3600 second to rotate once, and an outer cylinder takes 1/3600 second to rotate  once.

To keep things simple, let's pretend that your disk has only one platter and thus only one track in a cylinder. If your disk has 4096 sectors in a track, any given sector anywhere on the disk passes under the read/write head in 1/(3600*4096) second. That is ~67.8 nanoseconds no matter how far the sector is from the spindle. During that brief time period, 512 bytes of data (4096 bits of data plus some error correction codes, etc.) pass under the read/write head. So, any given bit of information anywhere on  the disk is under the read/write head for less than 67.8/4096 nanoseconds (less than 17 picoseconds).

During that 17 picoseconds, the read/write head must build up enough charge in some sort of internal capacitor (I guess that is how they work at some level) to permit a reliable decision about whether the bit is a one or a zero. ===>That is the true physical limitation that controls the entire design.<=== The fact that more physical disk material passes under the read/write head during 17 picoseconds when the head is positioned over an outer cylinder has nothing to do with anything. The read/write head  still has the same tiny fraction of a second to "integrate" (build up charge or whatever) and decide if it has just passed over a 0 or a 1.''


I realize that I took some liberties with my descriptions and examples, and I realize that none of the above is polished enough to go straight into the main article.. Still, I think an example or two with some actual numbers plugged in could make things clearer for many readers. In particular, the question of "why don't the physically larger outer tracks hold more data?" should be answered in the article (as I have tried to do).

[I just realized that I slipped from RPMs to revolutions per second somewhere in the midst of my example. Sorry about that. The time to read/write one bit should be on the order of 1 nanosecond rather than 17 picoseconds. Still, the basic idea is the same...]

I am assuming that what I have written can be used freely even though it was previously posted on the group website mentioned above.

''This explanation sounds reasonable. But I have heard several other explanations of "the" physical limitation. These explanations that try to explain why hard drives use [[constant angular velocity]] and CDs use [[constant linear velocity]] all seem reasonable, but it is not clear to me which one is the real explanation.''
''Using [[constant linear velocity]] packs the most information on a given area, so that's why it is used on CDs.''
''But why don't hard drives use it? Some possible explanations:
* If we keep the disk spinning at a constant RPM (as a few very recent computer CD drives do), it requires complex read electronics to handle the varying bit rate of CLV. It's cheaper to use simple constant bit rate electronics and CAV and throw in another platter to make up for the reduced data capacity.
* If we vary the speed of the disk (as all audio CD players do) so the read electronics see a constant bit rate, every time you move the arm to a different cylinder, you have to adjust the spindle speed. It takes a long time to speed it up or slow it down to exactly the right data rate. People prefer fast hard drives over really slow hard drives, even if the really slow hard drives store 10% more data.
* If we vary the speed of the disk (as all audio CD players do) so the read electronics see a constant bit rate, every time you move the arm to a different cylinder, you have to adjust the spindle speed. Constantly adjusting the spindle speed puts additional stress on the spindle motor, making the hard drive wear out much faster, and no one wants that.
* there is no good technical reason. Hard drive manufacturers started out using CAV because it was simple and it worked. CLV is technically better, but people are reluctant to try something new when what they already have works adequately.
* ... or perhaps some other explanation is the "real" explanation.

::Let's be clear about this: Hard drives are CAV because '''nobody''' wants to build a servo that can ramp the speed of the disk platter stack up up and down dozens of times per second as the head comb seeks in and out. Even most modern high-speed CD and DVD drives are CAV. But for hard drives, it doesn't matter with regard to density because disks used what is known as [[zoned recording]]. As you move out to the tracks farther from the spindle, the disks record more and more blocks per track, keeping the bit density more or less constant (although the bit rate at the head climbs by the ratio of the diameters).

::[[User:Atlant|Atlant]] 23:45, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

::: Really? Hard disk drives use variable bit-rate to pack more data onto the outer cylinders? That's news to me (and, if true, should *definitely* go into the article). Do you have a reference ? --[[User:68.0.120.35|68.0.120.35]] 08:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

::::See page 115 of this (rather long) IBM PDF document. [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg242221.pdf]. But, in brief:

:::::'''''Zoned Bit Recording'''''

:::::''Because track lengths at the inner edge of a disk platter differ from those at the outer edge, before zoned bit recording the bit density was higher on the inner tracks than on the outer tracks Sector lengths were the same at the inner and outer edges, so less data could be stored at the outer edge. Also, peak-detection read channels could not cope with the higher data rate at the outer edge (because of the higher angular velocity of the platter at the outer edge), thus limiting the amount of data that could be effectively stored. Zoned bit recording takes advantage of the differing lengths of the tracks and keeps the areal density constant across the platter.''

:::::'''''Zones'''''

:::::''The Ultrastar 2XP platters are divided into eight zones. Since the areal density remains the same, the number of sectors per track increases toward the outer edge of the platter. Zone 1 is located at the outer edge, and Zone 8 is located at the inner edge.''

:::::''The main advantage of using zoned bit recording is increased capacity without increased platter size. However, a side effect of having higher density at the outer edges is a higher data rate off the platter due to the higher angular velocity at the outer edge. The maximum data rate at the inner edge is 10.3 MB/s and at the outer edge, the maximum is15.5 MB/s. Also, more data is physically stored toward the outer edge; almost 60 % of all data resides in Zones 1 and 2.''

::::[[User:Atlant|Atlant]] 13:03, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

::Regarding the terminology: "sectors" are the basic unit of storage, though they don't necessarily have to be 512 bytes.  (Practically speaking, only special server-class drives had anything other than 512 bytes.)  A "track" refers to all the sectors at a given radius.  Well, since strictly speaking written servo isn't necessarily precisely circular, a track would really be sectors identified by the servo subsystem as being at a given track, which is something of a circular definition.  "Cylinder" used to mean all tracks down the disk stack at the same radius, but it's now pretty much synonymous with "track".

::I'm not familiar with all the reasons that the developers of compact disc selected CLV, but likely it was simplicity for the playback circuitry: when the data rate is constant, one doesn't have to do any weird buffering due to variable data rate.  Furthermore, since CDs weren't designed to be random-access devices, as playback is sequential, CLV didn't harm performance.  In the case of HDDs, if the spindle speed were CLV, seek times would be pretty miserable.  (Note that with embedded servo, servo frequency and number is still constant across the disk.)

::Since HDDs are CAV, that means that the linear velocity at the OD is greater than that at the ID.  Put another way, if data rate is maintained as being constant, then the BPI is ''much'' higher at the ID, which limited capacity.  In general, one wants BPI to be fairly constant across the disk to maintain optimal recording characteristics.  Since for a given unit of time, the arc length at the OD is longer, commensurately data rate is set higher at the OD than at the ID.  Older HDDs before ZBR had constant data rate (simpler electronics because of the technology level), and thus wasted potential density at the OD.  The additional complexity of ZBR was worth the capacity increase.

::A given design point has a certain areal density, which is equal to the TPI times BPI.  TPI is fixed across the disk, so to get a constant AD, one needs a constant BPI.  Still with TPI so high these days, aerodynamic effects are prompting investigation for relief, such as variable TPI (ick!) and sealed HDDs filled with a lower viscosity gas.

I personally have had short term reliability problems with such media and technically it's not so clear as to what is the life time of the  phases (even though the vendors claim long life).  A large local HDD (a 50 year old RAMAC at the Computer History Museum is still readable) with remote CD R copies is one idea or if you want to go even further have mirrored local HDD's with remote CD R copies. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] 18:43, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

:A disconnected HDD won't help.  Data recorded on magnetic media will gradually degrade over time (thermal decay).  This was one motivation for switching to perpendicular recording, as PMR is more stable than LMR, but PMR isn't a magic elixir.  Of course you could re-write your data periodically, but then there's the risk of mechanical failure.

:With optical media, some cheap stuff is known to debond at the interface between the polycarbonate layers (like LD rot), plus the dye quality (with respect to aging) varies from maker to maker.  If you want to go optical, I recommend Taiyo Yuden.  From what I've read and from personal experience, it's by far the best optical media brand out there.

:Multiple backups is wise, but my recommendation would be to have your most precious digital photos transferred to negatives.  Several services on the web will do this for you.  Just make sure you find out what the resolution of the digital-to-analog device is (it's usually 2-3 Mpx, but higher resolution setups exist).  Film is a proven stable archival medium, and if cared for properly will definitely outlast any HDD, and probably will outlast optical media and prints.  [[User:Gmw|GMW]] 07:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

Many mobile drives have drop detecting (accelerometers) circuits that move the head to a safe position before the impact preventing such damage.

Interestingly the manual does use K as 1,000 when, e.g. referring to a drum as 65K words.  The IBM S/360 mainframe product literature did NOT use k K or M in a binary sense for main storage.  Amdahl did use K clearly marked as =1024 in his seminal mid-1960's article on the s/360 but else where in the same article he used K as 1,000 without marking - no confusion.  The 8" Floppy disk of the 1970's was accurately characterized in decimal units and prefixes by IBM and most OEM's.  DEC may have misapplied the SI prefixes but I can't be sure.  So to somehow say this occurred in the 50's and 60's is IMHO factually and historically incorrect as demonstrated by these several citations.  Personally, I don't think it became a public problem until much later, perhaps as late as the Apple Macintosh.  MSDOS is pretty clean, for the most part spelling out storage capacity, main or disk, in decimal units without prefixes. I couldn't come up with anything better than what was already there so I reverted it.  If I had to say something, it could only be that the beginnings of the public misuse of the SI units is not clear but it appears to be after the Intel chip, and after floppy disks.[[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] 22:55, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::Reading these responses and the thread in [[Talk:Binary_prefix#History]] I see two groups arguing about two related but slightly separate things.  One groups says, "HDD's have always been base 10."  The other says, "computer bytes prefixes are historically powers of two."  These are not diametrically opposed facts.  HDD can be manufactured to base 10 capacities and byte measurment prefixes and be powers of two at the same time.  The sticky point is when HDD manufactures stopped advertisings 5 million bytes and started using 5 megabytes instead.  Like it or not SI does not have magical power over the electronics/computer industry.  They don't get to define Greek and Latin word prefixes for units of measure not included is SI.  It is confusing but the computer industry adopted the same prefixes with different definitions.  This was not a mistake.  This was not a misuse of SI units.  I admit without a federal supeana there is no evidence to support a conspiracy argument behind the current choice in HDD advertising lingo.[[User:The Goat|The Goat]] 12:25, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Like it or not, every publisher has an obligation to define his terms when he uses standard terms in a non standard way. For example, in the U.S. I can publish a temperature as 15 degrees without having to say Celsius, but if I meant Kelvin then I should so annotate.  There is no disagreement that kilo, k and K meant 1,000 long before it was used in a binary sense with regard to computer main storage.  The disagreement is only about '''when''' it became common to use SI prefixes in a binary sense with regard to computer main storage; that is when were [ 1) products specified using binary SI prefixes, or 2) advertised as such] AND 3) the associated operating systems reported binary SI prefixes AND 4) there was no disclaimer, (e.g., K=1024 as in the Amdahl article).  The earliest such system I can clearly identify is Apple Macintosh;  MSDOS and Apple DOS are relatively clean and to the best of my recollection so was CPM.  IBM MVS and DOS were clean.  I don't know about UNIX or DEC OS's but I suspect they were clean.  So in the absent any facts, postings establishing an early date for the onset of the mis-use of SI prefixes are speculative and inappropriate.[[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] 15:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
::::Sorry, SI didn't invent the prefixes they are Greek and Latin.  SI can only define the prefixes for SI units.  The unit '''the byte''' is not governed by SI.  So there is no such thing as "mis-use of SI prefixes" when they are used with the byte.  The standard use of prefixes when used to modify the unit the byte is the base 2 way.  The fact that some early articles included a legend (not disclaimer) highlighting K=1024 doesn't sway the argument one way or the other.  People often include extra information so that a unit of measurement is clearly understood.  Short/long/metric ton is a good example.  When writing an article I would always clarify I am referencing gross tons.  That doesn't mean my definition of ton is mis-used or wrong in anyway.  If a OS (such as MSDOS) reports sizes as thousands, millions or billions of bytes then it has nothing to do with prefixes.  It is just reporting a number of bytes. Not a number of kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes as those units are never used.  i.e. output from the dir command shows I have "14,717,014,016 bytes free".  Where is the prefix?  Any given OS' implementation isn't really important anyway.  What is important is the convention used by the everyday members of the particular industry.  I don't think anybody can make a argument against the computer industry's widespread convention being kilobyte=1024 bytes.  Of coarse it is possible to find many examples that contradict the industry convention.  Like a byte use to not always be eight bits and so on and so forth.[[User:The Goat|The Goat]] 18:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::So let me submit that it is very much in question '''whether''' there is any kind of "standard" that assigns the meaning 1024 to the prefix "k". I, personally, do not know a single person who has ever thought that a megabyte is "exactly one million byte", but I also don't know anybody who even knows the number of bytes in a MB. You, the reader of this text, cannot name how many bytes are in a MB, so why claim that this number is some kind of "standard"? As far as I know, everybody has always used the prefixes "kilo-" or "mega-" in the computer context as "'''about''' a thousand (or a million or whatever)". That is, if I go and ask random people how many bytes are in a gigabyte, the most common answer (after "I don't know" and "a lot" and such) is going to be "''about'' a billion bytes". Or maybe "''about'' a thousand megabytes". With emphasis on the "about". ''A megabyte is that odd number of bytes that has to do with the way computers count stuff that is close to a million''. Good enough for anybody I've ever talked to. Claiming that the number 1024*1024 (which you'd need a calculator to figure out because you can't even name it from the top of your head) has ever been some kind of "standard" would require either a standards body adopting it (nope, SI says megabyte=10^6byte) or some large majority of industry insiders using it in this precise way (nope, they say megabyte="''about'' a million byte") or the majority of folks on the street understanding it that way (nope, if they can name a number to the prefix "mega" at all, they'll say "million"). How is something a "standard" if nobody actually thinks this is exactly the meaning of that prefix?[[User:Iron Condor|Iron Condor]] ([[User talk:Iron Condor|talk]]) 23:30, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

I am suggesting that the disk spinning rate of 2007 be changed from an average of 5400 rpm to 7200 rpm.  LAPTOP HDDs have a 5400 rpm, but 99% of SATA or IDE HDDs on desktop computers use 7200 RPM drives.  Either way, enterprises usually use a SCSI interface on their servers, which go @ ~10,000-15,000 rpm.

== Bias in measurements ==

As a tangent to the endless "discussion" about the [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29#Binary_prefixes|use of standardized computer units on Wikipedia]], [[User:Centrx]] is using this section to try to push a POV that hard drive manufacturers should have marketed their devices using binary quantities, and that their use of decimal quantities is deliberately misleading.  (See [[User talk:Centrx#Hard drives]].)  In other words, they're deliberately mislabeling their 80,000,000,000 byte drive as "80 GB" to inflate the actual capacity.  (Since, by golly, everyone knows that the operating system reports it as "74.5 GB".  ZOMG I've been ripped off!)  I've pointed out quite a bit of evidence that hard drive measurements, when abbreviated, have ''always'' been abbreviated in a decimal way, that the decimal meaning was the one used by engineers long before they even invented these devices, and that the binary meaning was never standardized, ''de facto'' or otherwise.  So there is absolutely no reason to expect them to switch to the non-standard binary units, and there is no reason to assume that they are using the standardized units in a deliberately misleading way.  The hard drive manufacturers have explicitly stated their position.  Without evidence of malicious intent (like a leaked internal memo or the like), there is no more reason to suspect other motivations behind this than there is to suspect that the Titanic was intentionally sank for the insurance money.
{{quotation|'''In CMOS, FDISK, Windows File Manager and Windows Explorer, my IDE disk reports smaller capacity than the number of bytes reported by CHKDISK. Why?'''<p>Because there are two different definitions of a megabyte and a gigabyte. Hard disk drive capacity is calculated by taking the number of Cylinders x Heads x Sectors x 512 bytes per sector.

However, your system's CMOS, FDISK, Windows File Manager and Windows Explorer calculate disk capacity based on a megabyte equaling 1,048,576 bytes.

as being 7800 RPM instead of just 7400 for those really on the move etc!

: Years ago, there were drives with speeds we'd see as odd now. 3200, 3800, 5800, 6300, 14400...eventually the market settled on 4500, 5400, 7200, 10k and 15k for the sake of clarity. The first three are fractional multiples of 3600 RPM, an artifact of now-ancient drives that ran their spindles directly off the AC mains (they used synchronous motors, and mains frequency in the US is 60 Hz, so they spun at 60 revolutions per second -- 3600 RPM). Since 3600 was something of a standard when the first small drives came out in the early 1980s, it stuck, even though the electronic servos they used could theoretically run at any speed. 10k and 15k are nice round numbers (even multiples of 1000).

It's become popular to rewrite history by saying that SCSI stands for Small Computer System Interface, but the second S actually stands for Serial.

I'd like to see a proper summary of the competing technologies - these are actually very badly covered in the individual technology sections of Wikipedia  as presumably they are written by people who favour each technology. I've worked for 3 storage vendors all of whom displayed little honesty or knowledge in this area generally preferring the "what we have and more expensive is best" line to performance and reliability discussions. 
Comparisons  SCSI, SAS, Fibre Channel, SATA. SSD   

Here is my view of the performance and comparison criteria requirements to truly asses disk technology

1: Reliability - The single most important thing unless you have server level redundancy.<br>
2: Performance  under load when 80% full (Read and Write)  - everyone runs their disks nearly full - and the newest and most accessed stuff is nearly always near the middle of the disk. Main cause for “my laptop used to be great and now it sucks.” syndrome.<br>
3: Raw transfer speed - Like top speed in your car – oft quoted rarely used.<br>         
4: Hot swapability - important for servers and storage systems - can I unplug the disk without interrupting my business and how often does it work.<br>
5: Performance when empty -  a few people run lots of  large disks empty to maximise performance for the rich and ungreen<br>  
6: Length of cable possible -  Not normally important <br> 
7: Power consumption<br>  
8: Heat - normally related to power consumption but a big problem for people who buy 10K disks for their home systems.<br>
9: disk rotation speed - together with how full the disk is probably a key performance indicator  - but 10K and above disks don't survive well in uncontrolled environments.<br> 
10: Relationship of components - or why having a 2.4 Ghz CPU and a 5400 RPM disk do nothing for either performance or power consumption in your laptop.<br> 
11: Interface cheating. - More common than you think - a vendor needs to offer a new technology but doesn't have the technology today so puts on an interface converter - or converter chip on the disk. Voila your ATA disk is a SATA disk but with  a negative not positive  performance impact.<br>
12: Operating system support. Almost always when new disk technologies are introduced .Example  NCQ - the operating system dids not support it. And the first release drivers are always flaky. And then the drivers reveal a problem in the hardware so release 2 hardware comes out.<br>
13: Chipset/Bios  support - see above but for the PC or Server hardware <br>
14: Who owns the technology -Is it a licensed technology - this generally affects the price and initial quality. Licensed technologies generally have better initial quality because the specification is controlled not interpreted  - the "open/free" technologies generally better later in the cycle. Licensed technologies are almost always more expensive to implement. Firewire and USB are great examples of this cycle.<br>

:Add to this list an important but always understated element of perceived performance: access time. Compared to drives of the early 90s, today's readily available hard drives are on the order of 10000x bigger and transfer data 50x faster, yet access time has only about doubled. A marginal increase in access speed will pay a much greater dividend than even a sizable increase in capacity or bandwidth to the average consumer who cannot fill a 750GB drive even if he sets out to do so.

Yes, that's an interesting question... My 6 years old Quantum 30GB got its sound very little changed after one reinstallation of Windows 2000 3 years ago. Scandisk found one bad sector and it seems that the heads are seeking slower than before (I have defragmented it before and after that reinstallation and I am absolutely sure that this is not caused by fragmentation). I don't know if anyone else have noticed but my drive is making a little louder noise when the computer is running Windows 2000/XP than when running Windows 98 (and more louder when running Linux) although I use the same software and open the same files. Although after 3 years my drive is still working normal without new bad sectors, I think that the question about wearing the actuators of a drive should be taken seriously, not only when reinstalling Windows, but when defragmenting and choosing which operating system to run. Unfortunately it is difficult to find any information on the Web about drive wearing... Are there any experts who can help? --Lefter 13:01, 8 April 2008 (UTC)

== Turning a drive too soon after shutdown can damage its heads? ==

I had a misconfiguration problem with my BIOS and my computer used to turn itself back on as soon as it has shut down. I heard that turning on a hard drive too early (<5 sec) can damage the parking mechanism and the heads. Is that true? During the same couple of months, my drive (Quantum 30GB, bought 2001 y.) started seeking irregularly slow (it was defragmented) and I replaced it with a new to avoid losing data. But I couldn't repair my BIOS settings soon after I bought the new drive. Has the turning on caused a little wear/damage to the new drive? It's model is Seagate Barracuda 160GB (ATA 100 variant), SMART currently reports that the Spin Up time is 97 (all other values are 100, except Seek error rate, which is 69, but I hear this is normal for new Seagates)... --Lefter 13:30, 8 April 2008 (UTC)

:Highly unlikely, but possible that frequent power cycling would damage heads/disks.  Drives are tested thru 10's of thousands of such cycles. In PC's, typically nothing happens until the power supply decays, then the drive dynamically brakes (using stored energy in the motor if necessary) to stop quickly.  If the power supply doesn't decay to zero before it starts up again, a badly designed drive might have problems with the transient voltage of the power supply but it would typically lock up rather than damage the heads.  It is not just the PC's drive that will have problems in such a situation.  I always let my PC set for a few seconds after a "Bill Gates" moment.

:Yr defragmented drive with long seek times was possibly experiencing "heroic" error recovery - the drive had errors and never gave up until it corrected them :-).  Sometimes  this is spot related and u can cure it by surface scan and deallocating the spot, but if the drive is more than a few years old, it's probably time to upgrade

== Wrong image caption ==

The article contains the following image: [[Image:Hard disk head.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of a hard disk head resting on a disk platter, and its suspension.  A reflection of the head and suspension are visible beneath on the mirror-like disk.]]

The caption is mistaken. No disk platter or mirror-like disk are visible. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] ([[User talk:AxelBoldt|talk]]) 19:53, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

::The caption is correct, the gray, mirror like surface is a portion of a disk.  The reflection of the underside of the supension is clearly visible - e.g. note the two holes. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 20:37, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

:::I believe that's not right. What you see there is two read-write heads and no mirror-like surface at all; the platter would ordinarily be situated between the two levers (one head writes on one side, the other writes on the other side), but the platter was apparently removed for the picture. It might appear like a reflection because the upper lever looks just like the lower lever; both have two holes and cables attached to the actual read-write heads. If it were a true reflection of a single lever however, you wouldn't be able to see the full length of the lower cables.

::::at first i was going to agree with you, then i looked a while longer and became convinced it was indeed a reflection, then after doing some visual processing on the image (primarily increasing brightness) i believe you're correct. if you turn up the brightness, you can see two areas on the lower arm, offset to the left and down, where light cast from above is hitting the lower arm through the two holes in it. if it were a reflection, it wouldn't look like that. i think the neutral gray background that smoothly darkens across the image gives the impression of a reflective surface, but it's a false impression.

You may notice that the wires to the head are arranged in exactly the same way in the reflection." I guess that settles it. About the two bright spots you found: they can also result from the reflection. Light passes through the two upper holes, gets reflected off the disk, forms to bright spots on the underside of the upper arm, and we see the reflection of this as the upper side of the lower arm.

== Lead Image ==

I changed the image to this one ([[:Image:hard disk platters and head.jpg]]) that I took specifically for WP use with the aim of providing a good illistrative image whilst I had one in pieces and it's been reverted with the explanation that it doesn't show the reflection. I am interested in more information as to why. The image does show a reflection, it clearly shows the reflection of the arm, which really is much clearer that the distorted hand reflected in the other image. Also, I would say that the new image is a much clearer representation of the disk in use with the arm on the head rather than being disassembled with a screwdriver. Furthermore it shows more components of the hard drive - it shows multiple platters, arm, head, static magnet, PCBs, head park and thus has higher enc value for an article on the complete hard disk?

== Physical Mounting Position ==

Thanks to the authors for such an informative article.   There is one question, the answer to which may be obvious to everybody else, that needs stated definitively.   '''Can a modern hard drive be mounted in any position?'''  On an oblique angle?   In extremis, suspended temporarily from its cable?   The answer to this could be handled in a single sentence, though I do not really know the answer.   Thanks again, [[User:WPHyundai|WPHyundai]] ([[User talk:WPHyundai|talk]]) 15:59, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

:In general I suspect the answer is yes for modern drives, other than on the string, but you will have to read the manufacturer's specification to get a specific answer and even then it might be vague.  Here is a quote from a better written specification:
::"7.5.4  Drive mounting 
::The drive will operate in all axes (6 directions). Performance and error rate will stay within specification limits if the drive is operated in the other orientations from which it was formatted. 
::For reliable operation, the drive '''must be mounted in the system securely enough to prevent excessive motion or vibration of the drive during seek operation or spindle rotation''', using appropriate screws or equivalent mounting hardware." [HGST 7k500]
:Note the above says why a string is not such a good idea.  Also note the above is ambiguous about between axes.  The reason I think the general answer is yes is that modern drive mechanisms are generally well balanced in all axes and the servos will take out any residual static biases.  Vibration and recoil would be a problem on a string.  Early drives were not well balanced.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 17:39, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

== Browsing Slow with Larger Drives? ==

I recently cloned my old 10GB hard drive to a 160GB drive - ''it was the smallest that I could find.''

I note that the faster drive runs Windows much quicker but that '''browser load times are now longer'''.

I am told that this is characteristic of moving to larger drives, though I rarely see the matter stated in this context.   If this ''is'' the case, is it not better to encourage quite small, fast drives for browsing rather than giant ones?   Can anybody please shed light on the matter?   I thank you, [[User:WPHyundai|WPHyundai]] ([[User talk:WPHyundai|talk]]) 16:17, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

:Makes no sense to me, perhaps yr local Internet cache just needs to be filled.  Unless Windows does something silly with placement of its files, your existing 10G should only fill 1/16 of the new drive, implying more data under the arms without seeking (even if the new drive has fewer heads), a higher data rate, and a shorter stroke (access time) to existing data - all of which means things should run faster not slower.  But if you have to download a lot of stuff into yr local cache it will seem slow for a while and be dependent upon yr network data rate, not your drive data rate.

== Cheap power supply unit can slowly kill a hard drive? ==

Here in small (8 million) Bulgaria, some low level repair specialists are spreading this 
rumor, based on some unofficial statistics. But none of them even explains what 
does it mean to supply an "unhealthy" electrical current to a hard drive? They just say that 
you should not buy some models of power supplies. Is it the constant voltage or its 
boundaries which make one model of power supply better than other? The page contains a 
link to a site discussing hard drive myths, but I think this site is written by a lowest 
level expert who considers only the case with burning a drive by too high voltage. Can 
anybody give a more complete explanation? Excuse me for the poor English. --Lefter 23:03, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:Disk drives are hard to kill and they monitor their supply.  I'm not sure what are the characteristics of a cheap power supply but one of them might be poor output regulation which, in turn, might mean the drive detects an over/under voltage condition and parks its heads but then detects everything OK and returns to normal.  Drives are rated for 50,000 or more such cycles but in such a hypothetical situation a drive might "slowly" fail over time due to excessive cycles (called load/unload or start/stop cycles).  But you should hear the cycle.  Also there might be weird voltage during the power on as the cheap supply tries to ramp up, this in turn might cause multiple cycles. In countries where power is expensive, turning your system off when not in use may be more common and a "cheap power supply might also cause excessive cycles during the power on cycle. Again you should hear the cycle.  Just guessing a hypothetical cause, I doubt if short of way overvoltage that a power supply can kill a drive.

== What does the sound of a drive depend on? ==

I know that some drives provide acoustic management options to slow the speed of the heads 
and reduce noise. But I have a drive with acoustic management disabled and another which 
does not support acoustic management (according to the program Hard Disk Sentinel v2.10). 
They both produce a little louder/sharper noises when I use Windows 2000 or XP, than when I 
use Windows 98 SE. The sounds are even sharper when I run Ubuntu or SUSE Linux. I am used 
to listen to the sound of my drives and I am sure this is not caused by fragmentation, 
opening different documents or something of the kind. Is it caused by more optimized/faster 
or bad for the drive/worser system software? I am worried that NT based Windows-es and 
Linux can shorten the life of the head actuators! My older 30 GB drive got its sound little 
changed after one reinstallation of Windows 2000 (during the installations it used to make 
the sharpest noises) and started seeking somehow slower. I know this can be caused by the 
disk surface which can have weak/problematic sectors. Scandisk found two neighbouring bad 
sectors over 1 GB from the end of the drive. Hard Disk Sentinel currently reports that 
there are 74 automatically reallocated sectors. But I bought a new drive (Seagate 160 GB), 
exactly a year ago, and installed Linux on it as a second OS. During the time I used the 
Linux, the Seek Error Rate SMART value was 61 (below the average limit of 63, according to 
SpeedFan 4.32 online analysis). I have heard that new Seagates have low Seek Error Rate 
values. But when I stopped using Linux and worked only with Windows XP, the Seek Error Rate 
value started slowly increasing and is now 71. 
To be short: Are Linux and NT based Windows unhealthier for hard drives than Windows 98 SE? 
Is there a way to tune Windows XP or Linux so that the hard drive produces "softer" noises 
as with Windows 98 SE? Lefter 18:30, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

:See [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/59695  High frequency of load/unload cycles on some hard disks may shorten lifetime] for one example of how a Linux OS can systematically change noise (and failure rate).  It would make sense that excessive start/stop (or load/unload) cycles caused by poor choices in sleep mode parameters would cause noise and degrade a drive.  Once such problems are eliminated, I doubt if there is anything about Linux or NT based Windows that is "unhealthy" for HDDs.  If there are systematic noise differences between OSs, I suspect they have to do with caching and paging policies (more and/or longer seeks) but there is nothing unhealthy about seeking, per se; start/stop, on the other hand, is stressful.

== Form factor, etc. table ==

Although current 2.5" drives probably top out at 3 platters (I don't keep track), a couple past 2.5" drives that have 4 platters are the IBM Travelstar 3XP (17 mm height), and Travelstar 32GH (12.5 mm height).

== Faster drive, air drag? ==

The article states: "Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000 rpm use smaller platters because of air drag and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives."

This claim isn't cited in the article. But I'm not an expert by any means so I'm wondering if anyone could clarify the factual accuracy of this claim. My initial impression is that the inertia of the platter, and not air drag, is why faster drives have smaller platters and thus lower capacity.

It's been a while since I flipped through my physics books, so I could be off. Can anyone verify this?  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/208.65.221.154|208.65.221.154]] ([[User talk:208.65.221.154|talk]]) 19:51, 3 September 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

15K rpm HDDs, 10K rpm HDDs, and desktop (5400 rpm)HDDs all use the same size disks: 3.5" in diameter. The size of the motor changes to increase rotational speed. Mobile HDDs (laptops) use 2.5" disks, iPods and GPS use 1.8" disks, and for a while there was a 1" diamter disk for the IBM/Hitachi Micordrive.

Wait - the article says the 10K and 15K rpm HDDs use smaller platters due to air drag.

:The platters in the higher rpm 3½" drives are smaller than the industry standard 95mm disk[http://www.idema.org/_smartsite/modules/local/data_file/show_file.php?cmd=download&data_file_id=1003] used in 7200 rpm (and earlier lower rpm) HDDs.

How do hard drives work?

I am also aware of the various lists out there covering these software titles, including [[List of disk partitioning software]], [[List of backup software‎]], [[List_of_defragmentation_software]], [[List_of_disk_imaging_software]] and [[Data_recovery#Recovery_software]].

== Fast and slow parts of the disk ==

Hello there! I was just wondering if either the beginning or the end of a disk would be inherently faster and what kind of differences are we talking about there? (In practice you probably would want you OS or swap partition there.) [[Special:Contributions/78.27.75.173|78.27.75.173]] ([[User talk:78.27.75.173|talk]]) 13:08, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
:Take this with a grain of salt, but assuming uniform bit density I'm guessing that the edge of the disk would be faster to access, since it contains more bits and so a partition of the same size would have a smaller radius and so the head would move a smaller distance on average between any two random points in the partition. [[User:Dcoetzee|Dcoetzee]] 21:32, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
::The outer edge does have faster read times, but that is balanced by slower seek times.

:::Dcoetzee has it right for the outer edge of an HDD!  
:::*I don't know where MrOllie (or IBM) gets the idea that the average seek time varies much by radius because in my experience that is not true.  The seek times are strictly a function of the distance moved!  It doesn't matter where you start from nor for that matter which direction you move.  The average seek time is then a function of how many cylinders there are in the physical domain - the time to seek 1/3 the cylinders is a reasonable approximation of the average seek time within that domain. If you partition, as IBM talks about, the average seek time in the partition will be less than the drive's average seek time over all cylinders, because there are fewer cylinders.  Note that if the partitions are all the same size in GiB, the outer most partition will use the fewest number of cylinders and therefore have the lowest average seek time of all the partitions.  It is well established in SAN/NAS world that short stroked drives are one solution to a performance problem and that the preferred location is towards the Outer Diameter to take advantage of the higher data rate which is typically about 1.5 times the Inner Diameter data rate.  
:::*What is true is that if you have some object you go to often and its not too large, e.g. a directory map, it might be a good idea to place it in the center of its partition, because the worst case seek is then at most 1/2 the number of cylinders.  However if the object is large, the higher data rate towards the OD may be more important.  And if you go to it often, why isn't in main memory :-)

== AFR and MTBF ==

<blockquote>
Once the drive product is in production, the more valid [citation needed] metric is annualized failure rate (AFR). AFR is the percentage of real-world drive failures after shipping.

According to the AFR article, the AFR is calculated from the MTBF. It seems to me that this would *not* make it more valid.  Instead, it would make it more useful.  [[Special:Contributions/206.53.197.24|206.53.197.24]] ([[User talk:206.53.197.24|talk]]) 22:32, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

"Data transfer rate (as of 2008) at the inner zone ranges from 45 MB/s to 3.0 GB/s, while the transfer rate at the outer zone ranges from 74.0 MB/s to 111.4 MB/s." The 3GB/s figure is incorrect; these numbers are disk-to-buffer rates, not buffer-to-host. 3GB/s (GigaBYTES per second)is way too high these days. The author probably meant 3Gb/s (gigaBITS/sec), or roughly 300MB/s, which is the buffer-to-host rate for the "SATA 3Gb/s" standard (and still about 4x too high for the maximum inner-zone transfer rate.) I expect the correct maximum for the inner zone is around 75 MB/s. If I can find a reliable source I'll correct it. Anybody know of such a source? I'm off to check Seagate and Western Digital for some datasheets but I haven't found much in the past that details disk-to-buffer rates, probably because they are much lower than SATA interface speeds.

::Tom, the bar for inclusion of information on Wikipedia is not what you ''contend'' but rather what you can '''demonstrate''' by including relevant references. Glider87 is correct to point out above that you have not provided any valid information so what you ''contend'' be on its own cannot be used in the article. Also you cannot say "''Google for it''" and expect that to be good enough to except something to be in the article. Read [[WP:RS]] because it explains why your actions are completely wrong here. The fact that it has taken you so long to provide any reference goes to show how what you think is trivially obvious is actually not that trivially obvious. By the way, I could for example provide a reference like [http://www.disney.com/ Warp drives in use today] and claim it supports something I said. Obviously just providing a reference on its own is not good enough because you have to show what part of the reference is relevant to the specific text in the article. For your actions to be correct you should have removed the tag in the article and placed the reference you now claims to support what the article text says. What you did instead was to disrupt the article and edit war and wikilawyer.

You have not posted anything to support your unfounded claims either. I also note that now you have contradicted yourself because you have been using ad hominem and now you admit that Wikipedia does not need you cluttering up this discussion. Also Glider87 is correct because you are trying to use the logical fallacy linked above. Since your position is just a logical fallacy then it is weak and can be disregarded.

*Tom, stop being disruptive. You have not many any valid argument because you have not supported any claims you made, actually you were challenged several times and failed to produce any valid evidence. The link you posted does not support your claim that the fact is "''trivially obvious''", actually the link you posted shows this is not a trivially obvious fact. An example of a trivially obvious fact is something like "''clouds produce rain''" or "''the grass is green''". Since you claimed only you had done any research on this topic but you repeatedly failed to produce any valid link over a reasonably long period of time of being called upon to do so then the conclusion is that your failure demonstrates the topic is actually not "''trivially obvious''". Glider87 has not been making ad hominem attacks, you have been using ad hominem and making personal attacks and harassing other editors. Also your claim "''he claims a premise is false only because it has not been proven to his satisfaction to be true''" just goes to show how ridiculous your point of view is. Firstly, Glider87 has not claimed what you just misrepresented. Secondly, it is perfectly reasonable to expect someone making a claim to have to support it because this is how a valid argument is made. You made the claim this fact is "''trivially obvious''" and since nobody here accepted your claim it is "''trivially obvious''" then you have to prove it is "''trivially obvious''" by providing valid evidence, proof and a strong argument. Since then you have not provided any strong argument and have not provided any valid evidence. Since you have failed to persuade anyone that your claim of being "''trivially obvious''" has any validity then you have only yourself to blame for providing no valid argument. You have also been told to stop being disruptive by several other editors and yet you have refused to do so. So again, stop being disruptive otherwise you will face sanctions from the administrators.

====Stepping in to draw a line under this and prevent it from descending further...====
Some thoughts on all of this...
*The fact appears to be far from trivially obvious as evidenced by consensus, and as such it is fair to expect that it be backed by a citation.
*The fact is not contentious or damaging to readers so there is no reason to remove the information in the short term, it can easily remain flagged as cite needed.
*Consensus here is that the fact is not obvious and so the tag should stay. It is inappropriate to remove it against consensus.
*[[WP:BURDEN|Burden of proof]] is on the person supporting the fact to [[WP:PROVEIT|prove it]], not on other editors or readers to be expected to know something.
*Arguing against consensus and policy is disruptive, continuing an argument to such a degree over something so minor as a fact tact is unhelpful in the extreme. 
*I would say that the tag should stay until a cite can be found and if adequate efforts have been made and no cite can be found to back the claim then the claim should go until such time as a reliable source is added.

Unfortunately Mfield apparently has not read my argument or examined my evidence but instead relies upon a purported consensus.  Consensus requires discussion and so far there has been little discussion of my argument or evidence.
Thanks to Fnag we know that
{{quote|An example of a trivially obvious fact is something like "clouds produce rain" or "the grass is green".}}
Fnag doesn't say why these are trivially obvious facts but I assume it is because so many observers can validity these facts that it is not necessary to cite a reference to such facts.  Similarly I claim this sentence is trivially obvious.
{{quote|Note that modern commercial aircraft have a pressurized cabin, whose pressure altitude does not normally exceed 2,600 m(8,500 feet) - thus, ordinary hard drives can safely be used in flight.}}
because tens of millions (perhaps hundreds of millions) of commercial aircraft passengers in pressurized cabins have used or observed the use of laptops containing HDDs in flight without damage, warning from the flight operator of potential for damage or prohibition of such usage by laptop manufacturer or HDD manufacturers.  <strike>I have suggested that the fact tag could be moved to the altitude limitation of the sentence which to me is far less obvious than HDD safety in pressurized flight.</strike>  So far only one person has responded to this, citing the unpressurized DC3 which is not applicable.  
I also have provided a citation to an [http://www.dfrsolutions.com/uploads/publications/2004_HighAltitude_Hillman-Blattau.pdf article] that states in part that "Some typical hard drive specifications are:  Max operating altitude 10000 ft ..." and "The '''unpressurized''' airborne environment will exceed the disk drive specification"['''emphasis added'''] both of which agree with my contention that the sentence is trivially obvious.  Fnag claims to have read this article but some how he finds, without citation, that the article "shows this is not a trivially obvious fact."
It is not disruptive to ask for discussion, unfortunately I have to repeat this because most of what is above is assertions without evidence and/or [[ad hominem]] attacks rather than discussion.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 18:26, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

:Consensus arrives from discussion, there has been little dicsussion because you have not presented a valid argument to discuss. The consensus is that you have not presented a valid argument and the consensus is that what you have written has failed to persuade anyone here of your point of view. It is not disruptive to ask for discussion, but it is disruptive when as demonstrated above you revert war, use personal attacks, use ad hominem, harass other editors and keep on copying what other editors have written and use that to attack them. It is the first time you have posted anything like the explanation you have above, but the explanation still does not support what you have been claiming about the fact being trivially obvious. This is because it is trivially obvious that clouds produce rain and the grass is green because people in general can directly observe these things and it is widely known that clouds are made from wet stuff (or cotton wool or candy floss), but in general people know rain falls from the sky and that clouds carry rain. It is not trivially obvious to people that pressure has anything to do with harddrive operation because people in general do not know about the inner workings of harddrives, so do not know how pressure can affect drives and may also be unaware that modern aircraft operate on a pressurised system. It is because of this complex (to the general public) series of logical steps that the fact is by consensus deemed to be non-trivial. Speaking personally it is trivial knowledge for me, but articles are not written for me, they are written for the general public. So once again, post a valid argument to show why you think it is a trivially obvious fact for the general public. '''[[User:Fnagaton|Fnag]][[User talk:Fnagaton|aton]]''' 02:43, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

== How external interference could effect HDDs ==

I was reading through this article tonight, and realized that there was no real mention to how external forces (aside from air pressure, physical shock) can effect HDDs. Specifically: What would happen if someone put a strong magnet (ie like a 1 inch long magnet you put on a refrigerator) on the outside of the disk? Or for example if a strong EMP hit, say from a solar flare or coronal mass ejection? Or maybe a weapon is developed that can generate strong electromagnetic fields? Has anyone done any research on this?

It may seem a little "doomsday-ish", but one can't help but think that HDD's are really the only permanent large-capacity drives able to store data (Aside from certain optical discs in the works that aren't out yet), but they're magnetic -- but are they really safe from some of these external forces? I mean, so much of human kind's data is being stored on magnetic hard drives (Take Wikipedia as a prime example!) You hear of solar flares shorting out electronics in power grids, so why not hard drives? Imagine the panic if most of the HDDs (and therefore most other electronics) were wiped due to some disaster?

I'll do some web searching on the subject, but it might be interesting to include a few lines about in the article.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Cody-7|Cody-7]] ([[User talk:Cody-7|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cody-7|contribs]]) 08:28, 28 April 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:HDDs are pretty tough, particularly with shock sensors to move the heads to a safe location.  Regarding some other potential issues:
:*"Hard disk drive platters are mounted within a housing that in itself provide some amount of shielding to prevent a degaussing process from being effective. In our shop [now Seagate Recovery Services], we have exposed fully intact hard disk drives to very high levels of magnetic fields and have seen much or most of the data still intact on the device. The strength of any degaussing unit required to penetrate the Head Disk Assembly (H.D.A.) housing would probably cause considerable damage to any other diskette or magnetic media within several yards, perhaps even in the next room."[http://www.actionfront.com/ts_dataremoval.aspx]
:*Altitude is discussed in the section above, you can save your self a lot of reading by jumping to the end.
:*Since HDDs for the most part get their power from the systems power supply and are generally within metal enclosures they are fairly well shielded from solar flares.  Put it another way, if a flare is big enuf to get an HDD then we have a whole bunch of other stuff to worry about like avionics, automobile electronics, TVs etc.

Suggest putting it first in the section, i.e., before ''Data transfer rate'', because that subsection mentions "disk-to-buffer" transfer rate.

== HDDs in avionics; loss of cabin pressure ==

I'm surprised that, apparently, ordinary HDDs are used in the avionics of pressurized aircraft if loss of cabin pressure can crash them. I'd think it would be mandatory to use drives that are immune to that eventuality. Am I reading something into the text that isn't intended?[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 16:37, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

:I don's see that the article says, "ordinary HDDs are used in the avionics of pressurized aircraft?"  What it does say is, "Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about 3,000 m (10,000 feet)."  FWIW, the loss of cabin pressure will not immediately cause destruction so the HDD can be turned off and probably survive - the passengers will go long before the drive does.

You're right. Please excuse me for overlooking this as I reflected on what I'd read later (which is when I posed the question). I think what threw me is the sentence that follows the one you quoted: "Note that modern commercial aircraft have a pressurized cabin, whose pressure altitude does not normally exceed 2,600 m(8,500 feet) - thus, ordinary hard drives can safely be used in flight." I believe it could be improved a bit, and the issue I raised clarified, by changing the last part to "can be used safely ''by passengers'' in flight."

I should have said "trivially obvious ''given the preceding text''." The deduction could, however, be made even more obvious by noting additionally in the text that HDD manufacturers must assume a minimum ambient air pressure when designing their products and, understandably, use a value that supports human life and normal physiological function. It follows logically then that any artificial environment -- be it airplane, spacecraft, submarine, etc. -- that prevents asphyxia will provide the ambient air pressure needed to maintain a proper gap between the head and platter.[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 12:17, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

"Just because a new user suddenly appears who just happens supports Tom" You seem to be overlooking the fact that I've done more than express an opinion. I've demonstrated that the tagged sentence follows logically from other, unchallenged information in the preceding text. I've also shown how the logic can be clarified by providing additional information. (An added sentence should suffice.)

There has been more than enough time for Tom to to propose an edit but all Tom does is theaten and attack people instead. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 02:28, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I'll put the case more explicitly: We know that A (adequate ambient air pressure) is necessary and sufficient to ensure B (proper head/platter air gap) is true. We also know that A is necessary (although not sufficient) to ensure C (neighboring humans breathing and healthy) is true. I've suggested adding a sentence explaining further that HDDs are designed so that "adequate" is the same for them and humans. Thus, if we know that C is true, A must hold and, therefore, B is also true. Do you not understand this reasoning, or is it that you understand but believe other readers won't? In either case, where do you believe the logic fails? Perhaps it can be clarified further.[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 03:11, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

:I underdstand because I have more technical knowledge than Tom but other editors won't understand because it is not trivially obvious and the adminstrator's comments also say it is not trivially obvious. Produce reliable sources to support your claims. The claims have been there with the fact tag for long enough and Tom has not produced any valid reliable source. So the claims get removed. I must now warn Tom that he must not edit against consensus. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 06:00, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

You haven't responded to my request to specify where the logic fails in the case I presented. That case requires no technical expertise WRT HDDs to understand, so even if your assertion that yours is superior to Tom's is correct, it's beside the point. As for the admin's comments, they and the consensus you speak of pertain to the passage you removed and are irrelevant to the present discussion, which concerns the development of a revision that will justify removal of the tag. If you are unwilling or unable to contribute usefully toward this development, you should withdraw from the discussion until a proposed revision is ready for evaluation. At that time, a new consensus can be sought.

Meanwhile, given that the passage was permitted to stand originally and was not edited at all, let alone in a way contrary to the admin's comments, you should restore it. The timing of your removal action smacks of petty vengeance and intellectual cowardice. That is, your behavior can be interpreted as an effort to thwart an improvement to the article that, for some reason you haven't specified, doesn't suit your tastes but you can't/won't argue convincingly against. Furthermore, you appear to be trying to put yourself in a position to accuse Tom of edit warring if he posts a revision. This conduct is unseemly and you should correct yourself.[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 11:26, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

:"You haven't responded to my request to specify where the logic fails in the case I presented." - That is not relevant because you have not [[WP:PROVEIT|demonstrated]] your claim by provding [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. The threshold for inclusion of claims in articles is what you can show with reliable sources, not what you think or claim on the talk page. Don't you dare to even try starting with the personal attacks, Tom is wrong to try that and you are also wrong to try that. Since you resort to personal attacks instead of proving your claims with reliable sources that demonstrates that you are not willing to constructivly edit this article. I gave you several chances to provide reliable sources, you did not. I gave Tom even more chances to provide realiable sources he did not. You both use personal attacks and both just state what you believe without providing proof. You both act like you are the same person with the same agenda. Prove you want to improve the article by providing valid reliable sources. Until you and Tom apologise for your personal attacks you should be removed from this discussion and leave Wikipedia to those like me who work towards improving articles. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 12:17, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I didn't intend a personal attack and regret that you took my remarks this way. I meant to alert you to the unbecoming ways in which your removal action can be interpreted. I apologize for offending you and encourage you again to reconsider what you've done.

Your statements about having to provide reliable sources for claims, etc., suggest you've missed the point of what I (and Tom, I believe) are trying to accomplish: Development of a revised passage for which readers will agree the previously tagged claim follows logically from undisputed facts. A revision that meets this criterion is not apt to be challenged and, therefore, will not need the tag or a citation. It is illogical to request a source when we're trying to eliminate the need for one.

I welcome any assistance you can provide in composing a revision that satisfies the objective I've described. A good way to start would be to either confirm the validity of the case I made or show how it can be clarified. That case can then be used as an outline and expanded into an improved passage. If you don't want to assist, though, I propose that we table this discussion and wait for Tom.[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 20:45, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

*My actions are to stop Tom from being disruptive. I have seen no apology from Tom, but I do see he is continuing to edit against consensus which demonstrates he is being disruptive. He has edit warred on this same topic before and he is doing so again. You have not provided any reliable sources to support your claims. The consensus is that reliable sources must be provided for the fact tags. The consensus is documented above. I have eliminated the need for sources by removing the offending claims until you can find some reliable sources for those claims. It is logical that '''you''' provide reliable sources for '''your''' claims. Your claimed validity is not relevant because you want to include claims that do not have reliable sources and that is contrary to [[WP:RS]] and contrary to consensus. It doesn't matter how longed winded you want to make the argument here because unless you can provide reliable sources it won't appear on the article page.

Therealdp, sorry my question got u into this.  As you can see, Glider87 is not interested in discussion; he is ignoring your analysis just as he ignored my argument and the [http://www.dfrsolutions.com/uploads/publications/2004_HighAltitude_Hillman-Blattau.pdf citation] i provided.  There really has been little discussion, Glider just likes to fight.  I find it particularly appalling his deletion of an entire paragraph which has pretty much been unchanged since 2006.

== Tom being disruptive again ==

I urge an adminstrator to read the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hard_disk_drive#Stepping_in_to_draw_a_line_under_this_and_prevent_it_from_descending_further... summary] by the uninvolved adminstrator and read how Tom was being [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hard_disk_drive#Removal_of_a_.7B.7Bfact.7D.7D_tag disruptive] in the section before the administrator stepped in. Then read how Tom is being disruptive again on exactly the same fact tag issue. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 02:40, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I urge any admin who responds to focus on the more recent discussion, which has become an effort to develop a revision that justifies removal of the tag. If anyone is being disruptive here, it's Glider, who keeps posting without contributing anything constructive and has interfered by removing the passage under discussion without justification.[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 04:34, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

:As any admin who looks at your edit history will find it is you who is being disruptive because you just used several personal attacks. Also as I posted above there is justification for removing the offending content because the fact tag has been there fore quite some time and Tom has repeatedly failed to provide reliable sources related to the fact tag. As any admin will be able to see your account is new and has focussed on attacking me after it was me who showed Tom to be wrong in the first place.

Although I've been consulting Wikipedia for awhile, mainly to bring my computer-related knowledge up to date, it was only recently that I had a question (concerning the SMTP article) and created an account so I could post. Later, when I read this article, I had a suggestion and a question, so I posted those. Tom asked my opinion about the earlier debate and I shared it, then thought of a solution and shared that, too. You made a remark about my post that I thought missed its point, so I replied. Since then, we've debated, but it's only my last post that you deemed a personal attack (and I've apologized about that in the other thread). So, although our exchange has (unavoidably) skewed a near-virgin account, it wasn't created for the purpose of antagonizing you or altering an article I hadn't even thought to read yet and hasn't focused on attacking you. I've no history with you and there's been no collusion or connection between Tom and I (other than what you see on this page), if that's what you mean to imply. I'm merely a newbie who's become interested in improving this (and another) aspect of the article and judged it appropriate to respond to you.[[User:Therealdp|Therealdp]] ([[User talk:Therealdp|talk]]) 22:07, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

:::Tom thinks "it is trivially obvious that ordinary hard drives can safely be used in flight" but the PDF he included does not support that claim because nowhere in the PDF does it state that ordinary hard drives can be safely used in flight. Tom has failed to take into account the changes in pressure, even in a pressurised cabin there is variation, humidity, temperature and vibration. Tom's claim is [[WP:OR|orginal research]] because it makes an non-trivial assumption about a technical subject, see the section titles "Synthesis of published material that advances a position". The PDF link he provided doesn't go into enough detail about sealed disks to be useful for the purposes of being a reference. However I did find a cite that goes into much better detail to replace his poorly sources cite. Tom has a long history of being disruptive on this topic, just look at the consensus that was reached a month of two ago on this talk page.

It seems to me that it's flat out wrong to claim that because hard drives operate to 10,000 ft and commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to a lower altitude it is safe to operate laptops in aircraft. Hard drive altitude rating is not the only issue involved. A laptop's air cooling system, for example, becomes less effective as air density drops. It might, however, be reasonable to say that since commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to a lower altitude, hard drives with a 10,000 ft pressure rating do not preclude safe operation on such aircraft. Or if that is too much of a [[WP:SYN]], simply state that commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to a lower altitude and let readers draw their own conclusion. Incidentally, in looking for refs, I noticed that some hard drive vendors are now offering "automotive" hard drives that, among other things, operate at higher altitudes, e.g. [http://sdd.toshiba.com/main.aspx?Path=StorageSolutions/2.5-inchHardDiskDrives/MK8057GSC/MK8057GSCSpecs] which is rated to 5500 m (18000 ft). I think that might deserve a mention. --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 04:52, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
:::Your example is not a particularly good one since the altitude of some cities is higher than the cabin altitude of commercial aircraft, implying there are cities where such laptops cannot safely be used.  It is difficult to prove a negative, but do you really believe such a prohibition would seriously be allowed by any laptop manufacturer.  My point has always been that safe useage is "trivially obvious" to anyone who has traveled in a commercial aircraft and observed the many users of laptops and the specific enabling of their usage in flight other than during landing and takeoff.  I have yet to hear any argument against this. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]])

:First, my apologies. I saw a recent edit from you and didn't notice that you had self-reverted. As long as everything stays on the talk page and we avoid name calling we're cool. As for your proposed language, I see two problems. First, Wikipedia should not say ''anything'' is "safe" without an attribution or, better, a direct quote. See [[WP:NOTMANUAL]]. Second is the "so" language that draws a conclusion.  I've been looking at manufacturers' pages and they vary a lot. Apple rates its laptops to 10,000 feet. Dell says nothing. Both sell airplane power adaptors. I'd prefer to just say that hard drives are generally rated to 10,000 feet and commercial aircraft cabins are normally pressurized to a lower equivalent altitude, except when servicing an airport at higher altitude.

{{quote|Harsh: C4ISR Aircraft In-Cabin}}

<blockquote>Many C4ISR aircraft are wide-body platforms designed to carry large numbers of crew and large amounts of sophisticated equipment on missions. Examples of aircraft in this class are the E-3 AWACS, Airborne Stand-off Radar (ASTOR), or C-130, which functions in the C4ISR role in several variants. These aircraft present moderate levels of shock and vibration such as that from air turbulence, jet or turboprop engines and their spinning blades or propellers, and landing gear contact with a runway. Cabins in these aircraft are pressurized, typically to an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level, and temperature controlled to enable the human crew to work comfortably.

In-cabin use is a good example of an application where hard disk drives can be used. As long as the equipment is mounted inside the cabin, hard disk drives are able to operate because the required pressurization needed to float the drive head exists, and the ambient temperature is above freezing. With steps to isolate the hard disk drives from the moderate amounts of shock and vibration encountered during flight, they can function very reliably.</blockquote>
I think that is probably sufficient to include the statement in the article about using laptops with hard disk drives in normal pressurized aircraft cabins (in-cabin environment). Note:  C4ISR = Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. See: [[C4ISTAR]]  — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 21:20, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

*Can you find a link to something that doesn't include Google cache? That cite is probably going to disappear soon and isn't very good for [[WP:V|verifiability]]. The cite also mentions vibration/shock and isolation from the drives to enable them to operate reliably which refutes Tom's claims on the subject. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 22:59, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

So with or without a fact tag, how about:
<blockquote>Ordinary HDDs do not have flying problems in commercial aircraft because the [[Cabin pressurization |cabin is pressurized]] to an altitude that is less than the HDD's specified maximum altitude.</blockquote>
This combines the two sentences that Glider has unilaterally obliterated.  Note that [http://www.dfrsolutions.com/uploads/publications/2004_HighAltitude_Hillman-Blattau.pdf the article I cited] states "typical hard drive specifications are ... Max operating altitude 10,000 ft".   [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 23:43, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

:That still violates [[WP:SYN]]. I did not unilaterally obliterate anything either, I removed your attempts to be disruptive and removed text that doesn't have valid supporting cites. The Blattau cite is useless because it does not support the claim you are making because as ArnoldReinhold says above it is "flat out wrong...". So Tom a challenge for you, prove me wrong by showing the exact place in the Blattau cite where it says clearly that "Ordinary HDDs do not have flying problems in commercial aircraft" like you claim. The cite of course does not therefore what you write violates [[WP:SYN]]. End of story. Now then the cite from Becksguy is good to know but it is a link to the Google cached version which will probably disappear quite soon so a more permanent link would be useful.

:::Good! All this time Tom has been claiming "typical hard drive specifications are ... Max operating altitude 10,000 ft" or "Ordinary HDDs do not have flying problems in commercial aircraft because the cabin is pressurized to an altitude that is less than the HDD's specified maximum altitude" i.e. Tom has completely failed to represent the effects of vibration in any of his claims. However the cite from Becksguy proves that Tom's point of view is wrong because the cite clearly states "with steps to isolate the hard disk drives from the moderate amounts of shock and vibration encountered during flight, they can function very reliably." i.e. Pressure, temperature '''and vibration''' are important factors. This is a good example of why we cannot rely of what Tom thinks is "trivally obvious" because Tom's synthesis of material has completely forgotten the effects of vibration and as the cite seems to show the effects are important things to consider for drives to function reliably. If we had just believed Tom and let him keep claims in the article that did not have a valid cite then the information in the article would be incomplete and unverifiable. Tom has still yet to prove exactly where in the Blattau cite it says says clearly that "Ordinary HDDs do not have flying problems in commercial aircraft" like Tom claims. There is just one point of order I feel I must point out: The article cited is written by "Tom Boham, vice president for business development, VMETRO" and the article does make advertisement like claims for VMETRO SANcab and other VMETRO products. It is a bit like a paid for advertisement like appears like a news story. So I think the cite is a bit like a primary reliable source rather than a reliable secondary source, can we try to find a reliable secondary source that says something similar to this seemingly primary source?

::It is hard to see the relevance of an article in the Journal of '''Military Electronics''' and Computing discussing [[C4ISTAR |C4ISR]] about JBOD storage in military aircraft has much to do with use of HDDs in laptops in a '''commercial aircraft'''.  The current proposed sentence is not [[WP:SYN]] since it combines three reliably documented facts with mathematics:
::*HDDs rely on air pressure inside the the enclosure to support the heads at their proper flying height. 
::*HDDs are typically specified to operate at up to 10,000 ft.
::*Commercial aircraft cabins are pressurized so that the altitude typically does not exceed 8,000 ft.
::*8000 < 10000 
::HDDs have many physical specs, dry and wet bulb temperature, temperature gradient, humidity, shock, vibration, altitude, RFI/EMI, amongst others any one or all of which may be exceeded in any operating environment, including aircraft.  The current proposed sentence only deals with altitude and raising any or all of these is just a strawman's argument.  Glider never has proposed anything constructive and I suppose we will have to see if we can come to a consensus not withstanding his obstructionism.  Any one have any comment on this:

== My thoughts ==

After reading the whole article i think someone with a technical knowledge in the subject should go thoroughly over the language to make sure it is more exact. As it stands now it seems to me its a bit superficial and in many cases the language used makes the point unclear. I.e the use of plate instead of platter, "laptop HDDs" insted of 2,5" HDD etc. It could also be a bit more organized.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.236.242.126|213.236.242.126]] ([[User talk:213.236.242.126|talk]]) 02:02, 4 July 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
== Capacity and access speed ==

Under the "Capacity and access speed" section, the article reads, <blockquote>
"A typical "desktop HDD" might store between 120 GB and 2 TB although rarely above 500GB of data (based on US market data[17]) rotate at 5,400 to 10,000 rpm and have a media transfer rate of 1 Gbit/s or higher. Some newer have 3Gbit/s.[citation needed] (1 GB = 10<sup>9</sup> B; 1 Gbit/s = 10<sup>9</sup> bit/s)."
</blockquote>

It then talks about enterprise hard drives: <blockquote>
"The fastest “enterprise” HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000 rpm, and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6 Gbit/s.[18] and a sustained transfer rate up to 125 MBytes/second."
</blockquote>

I would argue that the article incorrectly sites the media transfer rate for the desktop HDD and should instead refer to it as the drive interface rate (3Gbit/s is the maximum interface transfer rate of SerialATA 2nd generation.  I know of no HDDs that can actually read/write that fast).  If you agree with that statement then I would continue and argue that providing only the interface rates for desktop HDDs and only the media transfer speeds for enterprise hdds is confusing to the reader.

I can provide some links to average transfer speeds for both types of hdds if someone wishes to continue this discussion.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Axonjacksn|Axonjacksn]] ([[User talk:Axonjacksn|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Axonjacksn|contribs]]) 14:40, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

How long I can assume that data is readable from hard drive if it is not used while storing? In other words how long data remains unchanged in magnetic hard disk plate in ideal environment? --[[User:Jouni Valkonen|Jouni Valkonen]] ([[User talk:Jouni Valkonen|talk]]) 02:16, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:There is no reason to expect the data to be gone although it might be difficult to access it.  For example, an IBM RAMAC 350, last used in the 60s still has readable data today at the Computer History Museum! Most of the electrical and mechanical components had long since failed or disappeared so it took a restoration team to access the data, but it was there.  I recently powered up an HDD last used circa 1995; it worked and I was able to retrieve data.  If a drive hasn't been used for a long time, I'd worry about parts sticking together and preventing motion (either spindle turning or actuator moving heads or both).  Rumors are that some folks have recovered stuck drives by freezing and thawing them.  If its a real old drive, you might have trouble interfacing it to a system, but the data are likely there.

== "RAID should never be relied on as a backup" ==

From [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=354879234 the article]]:
<blockquote>
"Eventually all mechanical hard disk drives fail. And thus the strategy to mitigate loss of data is to have redundancy in some form, like RAID and backup. RAID should never be relied on as backup, because a localized event such as a power-surge or a fire could destroy several drives at once. Following a backup strategy; for example, daily differential and weekly full backups, is the only sure way to prevent data loss."
</blockquote>

This seems controversial, is it just an endorsement for offsite backup providers? --[[Special:Contributions/129.244.241.84|129.244.241.84]] ([[User talk:129.244.241.84|talk]]) 18:26, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

:No it is not.  How does RAID protect you in the event of fire, theft, or plain old operator error?  It doesn't.  Mechanical breakdown is not the only reason to keep backups. [[User:Crispmuncher|CrispMuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 02:10, 10 April 2010 (UTC)

:Yes it is controversial.  RAID protects you to a degree, that is, no single failure of the RAID protected components will cause loss of data.  That may be sufficient for most people.  A power surge is unlikely to cause any one drive failure much less multiple failures and with regards to fire, how many people make duplicate copies of their photos and store one copy off site?  Personally I use a pair of local mirrored systems with a third local backup system - basically three copies and take my chances that a fire will take them all out.  However, if you really value your data then an off site backup may not be enough, take a look at [http://lockss.stanford.edu/lockss/Home LOCKSS] (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) for one end of the spectrum - a key aspect there is continuous checking that all the copies are correct.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 03:47, 10 April 2010 (UTC)

Not controversial, in my opinion, but should be expressed in a more factual and less authoritarian manner. Just as RAID does not cover the situations listed, backup is not a 100% "sure way to prevent data loss" either, as the backups could be destroyed or rendered useless due to any number of causes. How about:
:"RAID <span style="color:green">cannot</span> be relied on as backup, because a localized event such as fire <span style="color:green">or theft</span> could destroy <span style="color:green">all the</span> drives at once.

== Intro Missing Binary vs SI Units Discussion ==

I am going to jump and and say it's fascinating for people to argue over the trivial and ignore the elephant in the room.  You would think for the NPOV you could have at least have a mention of that whole GB/GiB 2+2=5 rewriting of history.  A more disturbing clearly not NPOV or rewriting of history is:
:{{Blockquote|Raw unformatted capacity of a hard disk drive is usually quoted with SI prefixes (metric system prefixes), incrementing by powers of 1000...}}

::With no mention that apparently for pretty much all of the consumer PC era up to about 1994 or 1995, since after that...when the "1 GB" mark was "reached" by changing the definition...not only was it confusing and a major story, but actually for a time only drives above that "1 GB" threshold used the "SI" math that it took years for them to get groups like the IEEE  and NIST to change the definition for them.  

:::No standards body changed the definitions of the SI prefix; we misused them deliberately, and often grotesquely, e.g., "M"=1024000, "Octal K"=512, and newcomers were unaware that it was a misuse. What the IEC did was to introduce a new series of prefixes. [[User:Chatul|Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul]] ([[User talk:Chatul|talk]]) 11:19, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

::Excluding this part of history and more importantly the huge impact and ripple effect it has had in general on the concept of specs and standards is to not give credit or blame where it is due.  Strangely (or no surprise) almost all the timelines of storage history skip over that "1 GB" mark for 3.5 inch hard disks which turned out to be the most important storage or capacity threshold in history and the first and only one I know of where a single sector's or company's marketing scheme retroactively became a standard in time.  This is not like rewriting even the 1950s.  If the car or airline industries are stuck with their historic mistakes or legal or marketing missteps...why should another get off so easily when it is well within recent memory.  

::There must be a single person in the industry or otherwise to put in a proper reference.  I think I recycled all my hard copies of Byte making fun of the first past that goal line...after moving the line.  This almost makes many historic war revisionist history seem pale by comparison.  The public evidence in all the lawsuits related are likely available too and will not be scrubbed so easily.

:: Can I really be the only person this bothers?  I know they already won and we have our new "GB" and "MB" now, but I would like to keep my reality based memory and history and give these influential companies full credit/blame for a monumental shift in computing history....pretty much the day the marketing departments got the engineers to surrender.

:I'm not sure I understand or agree with yr Bernoulli comment - the word does not appear in the article.

Some might argue there was a change in 1973 with the 3340 from high mass high load slider to low mass low load sliders and then in 1990 with the IBM Sawmill from positive pressure air bearings to negative pressure air bearings, but that would be TMI.

'''Performance Paragraph''' [added for clarity [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 20:55, 28 May 2010 (UTC)]
:{{Blockquote|Despite their utility, hard disk design introduces inherent performance compromises. The manipulation of sequential data depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the sole method to improve sequential transfer rates. While these advances exponentially increase storage capacity, the performance gains they enable are only linear. Performance relative to capacity in new generations of hard disks has therefore fallen with time. Operations on non-sequential data are further compromised by the overhead of moving the read/write heads to new positions. The more scattered the data, the more transfer rates suffer. The multi-layer caching structure of modern computers is a direct response to these limitations.}}

HDDs and SSDs power consumption is similar according to Tom's Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-hard-drive,1968.html). I agree with the durability of HDDs vs. SSDs, however, the instant-access of each storage device is dependant on the interface, whether its in a lower power state or not as well as condition, generally HDD dependant though. The access times are on the order of milliseconds and only enthusiasts would really be able to tell much of a difference.
:::::::: The gist of the first part of that sentence is that local storage isn't as important as it once was. The primary driver of the storage market is media: movies, music, and recorded television. While a few people may keep movies and the like on a personal server, the rest rely on Netflix, Pandora, and other streaming services that require very little local storage. 
:::::::: The second part of the sentence is an overview of solid-state characteristics that benefit portable devices. Any counterpoint is quibbling; almost every small portable device (e.g., iPads, smartphones, music players) uses solid-state storage for those reasons, and for at least five years, the market share of non-mobile computers has fallen relative to portables.

Again, no distinction between HDD and SSD as *hard drive* is a technical term shared by both. Should be re-written with less opinion and designations made between HDDs and SSDs.

::The second sentence is incomplete and not necessarily accurate. Some would say that storage capacity drives storage utilization, or that the two are symbiotic. The real reason hard disks dominate is that all other technologies have had flaws fatal to mainstream adoption. Other forms of long-term storage have all been one of two types: magnetic and mechanical (tapes, floppies), or optical and mechanical (CDs, DVDs). Both were either displaced by hard disks or never intended to be primary storage. We haven't had any attempts at the use of non-volatile memory for mass storage in the last thirty years. Flash memory is a paradigm shift with little historical precedent.

::HDD and SSD cost-per-gigabyte have accelerated at near the same rate for years. If this trend continues, we can expect SSDs to stay more expensive at any particular capacity. But since capacity requirements for mainstream users rise at a much slower rate, we can also expect that small-capacity drives (relative to the largest available capacities)  will eventually become acceptable for most users. Since the cost advantage of hard disks at these sizes will be minimal or even inverted (hard disks have a higher base materials cost), SSDs will eventually displace hard disks. The question isn't if, it's when, and since it's already happening with high-end laptops, I don't think it's reasonable to say 'hard disks will be dominant in the foreseeable future'. 
:::I actually agree that there is chance that SSDs might replace HDDs in laptop computers and even desktop computers since there maybe a capacity above which there is no value in these applications, much like there was not much value above 4 GB in  MP3 players.

===Comments on Performance Paragraph===
As I stated above this paragraph is all about alleged performance issues with HDDs whereas a neutral paragraph would talk about both the advantages and limitations.  HDDs have dominated the secondary storage portion of the storage heirarchy since the 1960s and all observers believe they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  In an introduction to HDDs I would think the article would point to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage|Computer Data Storage]] article and explain how a disk drive works and thereby achieves a balance in cost and performance between memory on one hand and secondary storage such as tape on the other hand.  The introduction should be based upon a reliable source and not some ad hoc WP:OR by an editor.  By reliable source, for example, I mean this paraphrase:
{{Quote box
|quote = Hard disk drives consist of a single disk, or stack of disks, which have a thin magnetic coating and rotate at a high speed. The disk surfaces are recorded using heads mounted on arms that are moved across the disk surfaces by a high-speed actuator. User data are recorded in sectors of circumferential tracks on the disk surfaces. Position information (called servo data) is embedded in the tracks as prerecorded sectors. Digital recording is used and information is read back as strings of encoded positive and negative voltage pulses that are detected in a recording channel. The mechanical and electronic systems of a hard disk drive usually consist of a head-disk assembly; the data channel, which processes the analog read signals and digital write-current pulses; and the actuator control system, which controls the position of the actuator and the head-arm assembly over the disk surfaces.

[[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 20:55, 28 May 2010 (UTC)


Alexdi now proposes the following paragraph about performance:
{{Quote box
|quote =The mechanical nature of hard disks introduces certain performance compromises. The manipulation of sequential data depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the sole method to improve sequential transfer rates. While these advances exponentially increase storage capacity, the performance gains they enable are linear. Performance relative to capacity in new generations of hard disks has therefore fallen with time. Operations on non-sequential data are further compromised by the overhead of moving the read/write heads to new positions. The more scattered the data, the more transfer rates decline. The multi-layer caching structure of modern computers is a response to these attributes. 
|width = 90%
|align = center 
|bgcolor = #F9F999
}}
There are a multitude of technologies that have contributed to the increased capacity and performance of hard disk drives.  Of the many, rotational speed is relatively unimportant and therefore is TMI for the introductory section of this article.  Furthermore there evidence is that both speeds and data rate can and will be increased as the market demands - if nothing else we can always go to parallel head transfer.  There is no evidence that performance relative to capacity is a meaningful metric.  There is no evidence that the caching structure has anything to do with disks, in fact, it has much more to do with memory bus bandwidth.  This whole paragraph is POV and/or bad OR and should be stricken.  A few sentences about the progression in areal density, its likely continuation and something placing its performance in the memory heirarchy is all that should be in an introductory paragraph.

:The disputed section absolutely has to go.

Make a section called limiting factors or something similar and stick it there, but please take it out of the opening.

::This article is not the place to decide which is the superior technology, and it is absurd to have an editorial on the merits of flash memory in the lead of an article on hard disks.

::::But there is no section in the article on the future of flash, so there should not be such a section in the lead (which is a summary of the article).

I agree with Johnuniq that there is no section in the article on flash and that is something we should address. I would recommend something at the end possibly titled "Alternative secondary storage" or maybe just get to the point and call it "Solid state drives impact on HDDs". We could start with a {main|Solid state drive} entry and then point out the numerous sources that talk about how little an impact the SSD has had on total HDD volume and cover the different viewpoints on the controversy. We could cover the basic differences between HDDs and SSDs without getting into the significant details. I think anyone looking at the HDD article would expect to see something on the technology that at least claims to be on the forefront of taking part of its marketshare.

Alternatives to hard disks for large-scale non-volatile storage are few. Only solid-state disks based on flash memory have made significant headway, aided by the popularity of portable devices that call for a level of power consumption, durability, and instant-access that hard disks cannot provide. These benefits come at a comparatively high cost-per-gigabyte, a factor that has slowed mainstream adoption. As of 2010, hard disks maintain the dominant market position.

::::I apologize for the lengthy reply, but I thought I would put all my thoughts together in one place. I certainly have an opinion on this topic, but I did want to clarify that I had not made any changes to “data is” or “data are” on this article. I believe they way Wikipedia tracks changes, if you make a change to a page it will assume you are making a change to something written by the last person to edit the article. I had made an insignificant change to the XML in the company infobox, but Wikipedia assumed the subsequent “data is” change was modifying my work (which it was not, unless I forgot another edit I did).

::::I often look to relevant style and grammar guides when trying to determine for myself whether I am right or wrong on a point of the English language (yes I am a native English speaker). In addition to that I also look at common usage where it makes sense.

::::I don’t think we are arguing that the original definition of Data (plural) and Datum (singular) are unclear. I think the question is whether society has now changed the meaning of the words. I think we all know this happens over time. Check out this from AskOxford.com:

::::http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/data

::::<blockquote>“Strictly speaking, data is the plural of datum, and should be used with a plural verb (like facts). However, there has been a growing tendency to use it as an equivalent to the uncountable noun information, followed by a singular verb. This is now regarded as generally acceptable in American use, and in the context of information technology. The traditional usage is still preferable, at least in Britain, but it may soon become a lost cause. Compare with agenda.”</blockquote>

::::Note the comparison with “agenda” which was in a similar situation and has since mutated like we are seeing for “data.”

::::Then I found this article and realized there was more to the definition than we all may be considering. I did not realize that Alexdi had already noted the mass noun definition for which I had not previously considered for this debate.
 
::::http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data

::::<blockquote>“Data leads a life of its own quite independent of datum, of which it was originally the plural. It occurs in two constructions: as a plural noun (like earnings), taking a plural verb and plural modifiers (as these, many, a few) but not cardinal numbers, and serving as a referent for plural pronouns; and as an abstract mass noun (like information), taking a singular verb and singular modifiers (as this, much, little), and being referred to by a singular pronoun. Both constructions are standard. The plural construction is more common in print, perhaps because the house style of some publishers mandates it.”</blockquote>

::::Here was the clincher for me when I considered other similar words (mass nouns):

::::Water, wheat, and information (mass nouns) are similar examples to the use of data in question. You can have “4 cups of water”, “5 pounds of wheat”, “9 pages of information”, and “500 bytes of data”.

In particular, not only is it incorrect that disk drives have an arm per platter, but the article cites drives that do not.

Yes a track is a block when that's all you can read/write.  Variable block size, that is variable by the user or application, was introduced by IBM with the 1301 and [[Count Key Data|keyed variable block size]] called Count Key Data (CKD) was introduced by IBM with System/360.  Most computer systems used fixed block sizes.  Variable block formats fell out of use during the 1990s - with IBMs [[Count Key Data|ECKD]] Extended CKD the smallest block is one track.

Variable block formats did '''not''' fall out of use in the 1990's, at least on IBM mainframes. Your claim about ECKD is incorrect; the organization of data on the track for ECKD is the same as for CKD. IMHO the details belong in the article on CKD, unless that would be TMI, but not in this article.
:I agree that any such material belongs in the [[Drive format]] and or [[Count Key Data]] articles.  I was quoting an IBM article about the "smallest block size" and can't find it right now but the point is that at one time disk drives were written with variable block sizes, even on one track, but today the block size is fixed and the variation in file size is accommodated in the system or disk storage subsystem.

== Notes on a reversion of some intro changes ==

Per the three sentences added in this revision:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=371238723

: "Hard disk drives have been dominant device for secondary storage of data in computer systems since the early 1960s. They have maintained this position because advances in their areal recording density have kept pace with the requirements for secondary storage."

The problem with the first sentence is that 'computer systems' is too broad a term. Personal computers existed for almost ten years before the first feasible hard disk entered the market, and it was ten more before they became standard equipment. While they may have been dominant storage mechanism for mainframes and the like, I see no information on Wikipedia or otherwise to support that assertion. My impression was that many large systems relied on solid-state memory long after the introduction of hard disks.

The second sentence is akin to saying 'The United States continues to exist as a nation because it has adhered to its Constitutional principles.' It's almost a tautology, grossly incomplete, and not necessarily accurate. Some would say that storage capacity drives storage utilization, or that the two are symbiotic. The article could benefit from a section comparing the hard disk to other technologies in a historical context, but a single line in the introduction is the wrong place for it.

::These two sentences are a paraphrase taken from Magnetic Storage Handbook 2nd Ed., Section 2.1.1, Disk File Technology, Mee and Daniel, (c)1990 and as such are a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] which is more than can be said for your replacement sentences or your "impression."  Furthermore since disk drives predate PCs by about 20 years so having a statement limited to PCs is a rather myopic presentation in an introductory paragraph.  The Wiki link [[Computer_data_storage#Secondary_storage|secondary storage]] in part answers a need for discussion of alternatives.  I do agree that a better term could be found for ''computer systems'' perhaps [[History of general purpose CPUs| general purpose computers]].  With this change, I suggest we revert.

::: There mere act of writing a sentence in a book does not make it accurate or  authoritative.

If the removed paragraph is incomplete, which I don't think so, then the appropriate action is to add to the article rather than remove it, or tag it for additional work, not revert to an even more incomplete paragraph.

Several comments.

First, for the use of disk drives as '''secondary''' storage on mainframes, IBM was not the only company to introduce operating systems in the 1960's that required disk drives: Burroughs, GE, RCA and UNIVAC all did. Solid state memory came along '''after''' disk drives were in wide use, and was far too expensive to displace them except for high performance applications, e.g., as replacements for 2305 paging disks. What solid state memory displaced was core, except in hostile environments. These days that's changing, but disks are still less expensive.

Second, if the article is intended to discuss only the head-disk assembly then inappropriate redirects to the article, e.g., from <nowiki>[[Enterprise disk drive]]</nowiki>, should be removed.

== Data Transfer rate is an exponential behavior relative to time, not linear as the article states ==

In the Data transfer rate section of the article,
 "While these advances exponentially increase storage capacity, the performance gains they enable are linear. Throughput relative to capacity in new generations of hard disks has therefore fallen with time."

This is incorrect, at least with modern drives that utilize the Perpendicular Magnetic Recording (PMR) design. The sustained transfer rate of newer drives that have far higher areal densities than previous generation (because storage capacity is advancing exponentially), are showing large leaps in sustained transfer rate improvement over a short period of time (large improvement across each newer generation; Exponential.

== HDDs vs HDD's ==

Recently Sanspeur tried to correct the grammar in the intro section.
:''The presentation of an HDD to its host is determined by its controller. This may differ substantially from the '''HDDs''' native interface particularly in mainframes or servers.''
The change was to correct the entry ''HDDs'' to ''HDD's'' as a possessive of a singular noun. Currently it reads as a plural of a noun, but that is not the intent of the sentence. Often times people will erroneously add an apostrophe ''s'' to a word to show a plural noun which is in error. This time the change to apostrophe ''s'' would have been appropriate. You can see that the sentence is a possessive condition because you are reword it as:
:''This may differ substantially from the native interface of the '''HDD''' particularly in mainframes or servers.''
You can see the sentence makes sense because we are talking about the interface which is a possession of the HDD. Unless there is opposition to this change I propose we get a few to confirm my assumption and make the change to ''HDD's''.

Short answer: In hard drive labeling, the M, G, etc., prefixes are used in their powers-of-1000 sense: 1 GB on a hard drive box means 1000 MB, 1 MB means 1000 KB, and 1 KB means 1000 bytes; and so it has been since the very first hard drive. Windows however reports the sizes of hard drives, partitions, files, etc., using the same prefixes to mean powers of 1024 - as it does with memory. See [[Binary prefix]] for the whole confusing story. p.s.: MB = 1024000 bytes was only ever re. floppy disks AFAIK.  [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 19:37, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

== Misleading text ==

From the "Technology" section:

:HDDs record data by magnetizing ferromagnetic material directionally, to represent either a 0 or a 1 binary digit. They read the data back by detecting the magnetization of the material.

Although it does not say so outright this verbiage at best does nothing to countradict, and at worst could be read as perpetuating, the myth that a 0 is represented by magnetization with one polarity and a 1 with the opposite polarity. I have tried but have not been able to come up with a succinct way of telling, if not the whole truth, something which is much closer to the truth than this. Anyone? [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 06:36, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

: how about

::User data are recorded by HDDs as a series of physically separated magnetic transitions (north to south, south to north, etc) written onto a ferromagnetic material; during playback the transitions are detected and decoded to recover the user data.

:More precisely, user data bits are encoded into channel data bits where the ones in the channel data bits are represented by a transition written onto a ferromagnetic material ...  But that maybe TMI [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 16:50, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

== Firewire drives ==

To the best of my knowledge all Firewire drives are a subsystem consisting of a conventional HDD with a controller that translates the native interface into a Firewire interface.  This is an article about HDDs and not about the subsystems so Firewire as well as many other subsystem's interfaces, e.g. ethernet, should not be listed in the "connects to" portion of the info box.

::When a SCSI attached subsystem consisted of an HBA a SCSI controller and an MFM drive, SCSI was not a drive interface and would not be appropriate for the article. As soon as native SCSI drives became available, SCSI became a drive interface and thereinafter should have been be included.  This all happened before Wikipedia.  USB recently became a native HDD interface; its disk controller built into the HDD.  Firewire is not yet and probably never will be a native drive interface.  Nor for that matter is Ethernet even though NAS subsystems could arguably be just as much an HDD as are firewire drives (a drive with its native interface plus a controller and maybe a power supply all in one box).

We should explain this in the article. I truncated the "info" box because I thought it was ambiguous, irrelevant, and just too much detail to put into a box. FireWire, Ethernet and so on are ways to interface to a box that has drives+cable interface+power supply  in it. We have to be clear about what "drive" means when talking about "drive interfaces" - if I buy a disk drive at Staples, I'm as likely need an Ethernet cable as an SATA cable. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 22:39, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

== "Temporary" ? ==

The article says something like ''Since hard drives have reached a temporary 2TB MBR partition limitation in the last few years,''.  This wants explaining. We should probably link MBR which I think means "Master boot record".  Why is this "temporary"?  How "temporary" - fixed in the weekly Windows service pack, or fixed when all of today's computers have hit the trash and new machines with new BIOSes come out? And why does the MBR limit drive size to 2 TB? As long as the BIOS can find the Windows boot loader, what does the MBR matter? --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 13:43, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

: The trouble is that the MBR sector also contains (in addition to the boot code) the partition table, which is of extremely constrained size. The whole truth would be close to: "The format of the MBR limits the location of any partition an MBR-only BIOS wants to boot from to within the first 2 TB, and similarly limits the location of any partition an MBR-using OS wants to find." There is no hard and fast reason why partitions beyond 2 TB could not be located by other means, even if the boot partition was found via MBR. It is just a widely accepted convention that either the MBR partition table describes all of the drive's partitions, or else the drive is organized with a GPT.  Never MBR + something else to describe partitions beyond 2 TB. (Well, unless you're running VMS, which lacks the partition concept completely; no one misses it.) 

: Windows today can already boot from GPT disks (assuming an EFI BIOS) as of course can MacOS and Linux. I think the real point here is to avoid an implication that the hard drive makers are somehow responsible for the limits of the MBR. It is probably the case that HD makers are reluctant to ship 3 GB drives to the consumer space as they will be just asking for a bazillion support calls due to the MBR issue...  but at the moment that guess is pure OR.

== List in [[Hard_disk_drive#History|History]] Section ==

I suggest we all should feel free to add a '''FEW''' more highlight measurements and possibly metric conversion to the list of measurements in [[Hard_disk_drive#History|History]] Section, but I think the list should be short with all product specific examples in the main history article.  I also think the values of the measurements in the list should be generic so that the list does not have to be continuously updated as the areal density progression continues. 

Accordingly I backed out some recent changes that reflected the latest products and prices but really didn't add to the point of the section. As it reads now I believe the progression is reasonably accurate for today's state of the art. Comments? [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 18:15, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

== Technology > Components and overall quality ==

After having read the whole article, here are my thoughts:
* The overall quality is quite high and very accessible. It is well written and has a good flow.
* The components subsection inside the technology section is a bit obscure to me. I think it needs rewording.
* There are many images showing the same things in the articles. Maybe consider removing some of them?

Kudos to the writers anyway.

: In the vast majority of drives there is just one head per surface.

Aside from tone, which I don't see as a big deal, the real problem with the referenced imbedded comment is this: It says "The purpose of the table is to compare kilo- and kibi-style prefixes", but no OS in anything like common use uses kibi-style prefixes to display HD sizes - so why compare them?

:We should have put a stop to this nonsense just by pointing out that the RSs directed to a general-interest readership aren’t using kibibytes and tibibytes to denote storage space, and the hard drive manufacturers aren’t using such terminology when they sell bare drives or external drives in boxes at retail locations. To my knowledge, the hard drive manufacturers aren’t even using such terminology to communicate with engineers, but that’s just icing on the cake since this article isn’t directed to that kind of readership.<p>The First Commandment on Wikipedia is “Thy articles shall follow the majority of the RSs”. Why this table has been allowed to persist so long is only because of certain editors who have claimed ownership to this article and cybersquatted it.

:That seemed terribly combative and to be an unusual tone that would never normally be permissible on Wikipedia. But then, this particular article doesn’t seem to be a normal part of Wikipedia nowadays. I can only guess as to what editor might have been responsible for such an editors’ note. And, given that we have some tendentious editors on Wikipedia, I thought it unwise to delete such an tone and instead simply expanded it with this:

::<code>Please see <nowiki>[[WP:MOSNUM#Quantities of bytes and bits]]</nowiki> for additional  guidance in communicating binary capacity.</code>

:I expect that no one will object to my addition; it seems rather benign and objective to me, the purpose being to point editors to Wikipedia’s style guide for more information since not every editor is familiar with the inner workings and resources as are those engaged in this discussion.

In order to game the above RfC, [[User:RaptorHunter]] contacted over 100 members <s>of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Linux]]</s> <u>[''correction:'' directly, 18% of whom were members of  [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Linux]],]</u> only a day after noting on this talk page ({{diff|Talk:Hard disk drive|prev|423237198|here in this ∆ edit}}) that Ubuntu uses the IEC prefixes. Clearly, with Ubuntu at something like a 1% share of the computer operating system market, this was vote-stacking at its finest.

This use of the IEC prefixes in that table has only persisted because of a few tendentious editors preventing the removal after MOSNUM adopted guidelines against their use to denote binary capacity. The consensus view on MOSNUM after three months of debate was that the IEC prefixes simply aren’t used in mainstream computing for communicating to a general-interest readership and are therefore entirely unfamiliar to an overwhelming percentage of our readership. Since terminology like “mebibyte (MiB)” is not even in Microsoft’s Dictionary of Computing Terms and is not used by manufacturers of PCs nor by even manufacturers of hard drives, it comes as no surprise that computer magazines directed to a general-interest readership don’t have mention of “computers with 2&nbsp;GiB of RAM”. As always, Wikipedia must follow the RSs. [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits|MOSNUM#Quantities of bytes and bits]] is has perfectly crafted advise on how to address describing the magnitude of binary quantities that makes perfect sense and adheres to Wikipedia’s core principals so that the information its pages are of accurate and balanced and of utility to our readership.

|2=Canvassing argument not germane to the article}}
== IEC prefixes and WP:MOSNUM ==

Per [[Wikipedia:MOSNUM#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits]]:
One of the exceptions for binary prefixes is:

" in articles specifically about '''or explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes'''. "

This table compares SI and binary prefixes. That counts as "explicitly discussing" it. Saying that 1000 TB = 931 TB is just confusing. For the purpose of this table, it makes much more sense to use binary prefixes for comparison purposes: 1000 TB = 931 TiB 

Also, some editors are under the mistaken impression that no one uses IEC prefixes, ergo they are not worth mentioning. Here is a list of all the software using IEC prefixes: [[Binary_prefix#Software]] and [[Timeline_of_binary_prefixes#2000s]] The second most popular OS: '''Mac OSX''' defines SI units properly. (1GB = 1000000000 bytes) The entire '''linux kernel''' use the IEC standard. Is it really so terrible to have a table comparing them in this article?

To the guy that keeps changing IPs to edit the table, yes WP:MOSNUM does say that. I have directly quoted it. If you can't refute my point on this talk page, then you don't get to continually revert. --[[User:RaptorHunter|RaptorHunter]] ([[User talk:RaptorHunter|talk]]) 17:11, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

: This article is about hard drives not IEC prefixes so that exception in MOSNUM does not apply. The table is to compare kilobyte with numbers of bytes. The consensus on Wikipedia is to not use IEC. WP:MOSNUM says do not use this disambiguation. According to MOSNUM it makes more sense to numbers and not use IEC.

*This is an appropriate and useful application of IEC prefixes, per [[WP:COMMON]], and arguments by Wtshymanski, RaptorHunter, and Jeh. I believe the IP editor means well, but an inflexible application of the guideline [[WP:MOSNUM]] leads in this case to the logical absurdity of saying that 1 TB is equivalent to 0.9095 TB, using exactly the same unit of measurement. It should be obvious that any guideline cannot possibly cover all conceivable circumstances, and this use does seem to fall within the spirit of the exemption noted there and above. The argument that using both prefixes improves clarity seems to be the best for our readers. Although I have edited this article in the past, I'm uninvolved in this particular edit war or issue. Good call on the page protection. — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 21:30, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

: Note that [[WP:MOSNUM]] proclaims itself to be a guideline, which is a different thing from policy. And it even says at the very top: "Use common sense in applying [this guideline]; it will have occasional exceptions." This looks like one of them. Even if there was no credible argument that the exceptions in the [[WP:COMPUNITS]] section applied here (and there is), there's certainly credible argument that the global "escape clause" applies. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 23:33, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

*I do not think this is an appropriate use of IEC prefixes for a few reasons.
*#Is the column of extra values needed? I think not because there are already two columns of values to disambiguate, one in the decimal sense and one in the binary sense. It looks overly messy to include fractional values with the IEC prefix.
*#As far as I know there have been no instances of hard drive manufacturers using IEC prefixes and certainly none cited for the use in the table so it is against [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:NPOV]] to try to make it look like they are used for this topic. Since the sources for this topic do not use IEC prefixes then this article should not do so especially since [[WP:MOSNUM]] gives alternatives.
*#Even assuming the extra column of values is needed with the fractional values the question then becomes one of how to write these values and on this [[WP:MOSNUM]] is clear where it says "Disambiguation should be shown in bytes or bits, with clear indication of whether in binary or decimal base." There are some exceptions "when the article is on a topic where the majority of cited sources use the IEC prefixes" but this is not relevant since the sources do not use IEC prefixes. Or "when directly quoting a source that uses the IEC prefixes" again this is not relevant for the same reason. Lastly there is "in articles specifically about or explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes" which does not apply because this this article is not specifically about or explicitly discussing IEC prefixes.
*Instead the table can be edited in this way which makes it smaller and easier to read as well as following the guidelines.

*As everyone can see the table still makes it clear what numbers are in the binary or decimal sense. So as you can all see when written like this it is superfluous to include the third column. Keep in mind the text in [[WP:MOSNUM]] regarding IEC prefixes was written to give guidance on how to reduce the use of IEC prefixes to places where it is strictly necessary to use them. In this case it is obviously not necessary. It follows [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:NPOV]] by specifically not including any conversions to IEC prefixes. It follows [[WP:MOSNUM]] by using powers.

::For some strange reason you are doing everything in your power to avoid using these binary prefixes. You even changed the words binary prefix to the very strange "in the binary sense".

::Furthermore, your argument that HDD manufacture's do not use binary prefixes is invalid here. The table is comparing how the OS measures space to how the hard drive manufacturer's measure space.
::It's as if some Wikipedia editor's want to do everything they can to censor any Byte measurement that has a little "i" in it. The "i" is accepted by an international standard's body.

It does no good to waste one single line of this article to using units of measure (gibibytes) when such units and terminology are not used by one single computer manufacturer in any materials directed to their customer base—not in their advertising, brochures, packaging, or instruction manuals. Because of this fact, no computer-related magazines that are directed to a general-interest readership use such terminology.

:RaptorHunter replying to your comment: The article about [[Binary Prefix|binary prefixes]] uses the phrases "in the decimal sense" and "in the binary sense" so it is not my use, nor is it "very strange" or vague. It is very relevant that HDD manufactures do not use IEC prefixes because to try to use IEC prefixes in an article about hard drives is against [[WP:NPOV]]. That is the consensus that was agreed for [[WP:MOSNUM]]. As for "is accepted by an international standard's body" [[WP:MOSNUM]] says "Wikipedia follows common practice regarding bytes and other data traditionally quantified using binary prefixes" and then says "Despite the IEC's 1998 guideline creating several new binary prefixes". It is not relevant what a "international standard's body" thinks because what is relevant is Wikipedia showing what is in common use. A question for you, keepng in mind Wikipedia follows common practice is it common practice to use IEC prefixes for the subject of hard drives? The answer is, of course not. Another question, has consensus changed to show a common practice of using IEC prefixes? Answer, no of course not.

:: It occurs to me that the goal of the table is to contrast correct numbers with how they are displayed by a very commonly used operating system (among other software). And Windows does say e.g. "500 GB", but using "GB" in the binary sense. One solution: in the table proposed above by Glider87, change the "binary sense" column head to "As displayed by Windows and some other software", use the TB or GB notation in that column, and not use it at all elsewhere in the table? That is after all how Windows displays hard drive and file sizes - with SI-like prefixes but used in the binary sense. And it sidesteps the "1000 GB = 931 GB" issue. It does not however address the software that exists that ''does'' use IEC prefixes, or SI prefixes in their decimal sense. Do we just pretend that no such software exists? That HD and file sizes are ''never'' displayed with either SI prefixes used in the decimal sense, or with IEC prefixes? [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 02:06, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

Reference [[WP:UNDUE]] and ask is it relevant to this article that a minority of software uses IEC prefixes or is it relevant that the majority of software does not use IEC prefixes.

Did you read what I wrote in my 01:25, 8 April 2011 post, Glider87? Yes, I agree with you 100%. You are correct and this debate is moot. This was settled a long time ago and it’s final. See [[Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Avoiding_confusing_IEC_prefixes|WT:MOSNUM#Avoiding confusing IEC prefixes]]. This attempt to use the IEC prefixes in a computer-related article is precisely what MOSNUM’s guidelines are intended to prevent. There isn’t a snowball’s chance in h-e-double hockey sticks that there would ever be a consensus to allow the IEC prefixes to be used in this fashion. The admin might as well unlock the article for this isn’t a close call and the argument that the IEC prefixes can be brought back is without any foundation.

To RaptorHunter: Please take two readings of [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)/Archive/Complete rewrite of Units of Measurements (June 2008)|Complete rewrite of Units of Measurements (June 2008)]] and call me in the morning if you still don’t *get it*. We don’t use the IEC prefixes like you are trying to do because ''it doesn’t matter if they are way-cool.'' The consensus after long debate was that they are clearly unfamiliar with our readership and will not be used on Wikipedia unless the article is squarely on the issue of discussing the units of measure—not by merely using them in a table.

User:Jeh offers a perfectly satisfactory solution to this, none of which relies upon using a stuttering unit of measure (gibibytes) that precious too few readers have ever heard of. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 02:17, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

::Futhermore, I don't want IEC prefixes because they are "way cool". In fact I think they sound kind of stupid. (kibibyte?) They need to stay because they clarify the difference between SI units and computer units. The software industry has been misappropriating SI prefixes to mean something they don't for decades. The ideal solution of course would be for software makers to actually use SI prefixes correctly, just like hard drive manufactures are now. 1 GB = 1 billion bytes and 1 MB = 1 million bytes.

What you have written looks a lot like [[WP:IJDLI]] which is a "weak and feeble an argument" and "hold little to no water at Wikipedia".

*So given that RaptorHunter's arguments have been refuted. I agree with Jeh that we should "punt the issue entirely" and refer to the [[Binary prefixes]] article. Remove the "Following are the several ways of reporting one Terabyte." and the table. Instead replace the text "some operating system utilities" with [[binary prefixes|some operating system utilities]]. That should solve the issues. Anyone have any problems with that?

::*RaptorHunter, quoting you: {{xt|You are attempting to censor the existence of a unit recommended from an international standards body.}} “Censored” “Banned”. “Matter of style”. Call it what you will. That argument was the ''very foundation'' of the IEC-prefix proponents over on MOSNUM when this issue was settled. Ultimately, ''that argument was rejected by a consensus''. So you are re-raising arguments that were carefully considered and soundly dismissed by the community. Do  you understand this point? Or do you understand that this is a sad fact but think that by convincing Glider87 and me you can turn MOSNUM on its ear?<p>The BIPM (the SI gods) say that a space must be used between the numeric value and the unit symbol. Thus, it is supposed to be {{xt|75&nbsp;%}} and not the {{xt|75%}} the rest of the world (including Wikipedia) uses. It matters not that there is a standard from a widely respected organization saying we are supposed to do otherwise. If you want to debate the issue here, then—by definition—an outcome per your wishes on this article will be contrary to MOSNUM.

We won’t have the standard handful of IEC fanatics violating the clear intent of MOSNUM. The consensus finding was that the IEC prefixes are unfamiliar to readership because not one single manufacturer of personal computers when communicating with their customer base uses such terminology. Consequently, no general-interest computer magazine uses such terminology to describe capacity—that is, unless it is a special article talking about the IEC’s proposal that colossally failed to catch on in the real world. The normal routine, when faced with communicating drive capacity, merely state something like “2 terabytes” and add an asterisk leading to a footnote that “1 terabyte equals 1,000,000,000,000 bytes.” MOSNUM provides guidance on how to do this. It’s not difficult. Any proponent of the IEC prefixes who participated in those past MOSNUM discussions and who now attempts to exploit this flare-up by trying to use measures that are entirely unfamiliar to our readership in contravention of the guidelines will end up the subject of an ANI because they ''know better'' and are just being tendentious and disruptive.

I cannot believe this is still going. Here are some reasons for <u>not</u> including the IEC prefixes in this article:
#They are not recognised by the average readership of WP.
#They serve to make the article more complex, and we should be aiming to explain things as simply as possible.
#Try walking into your local computer store and asking for a 500 gibibyte hard-disk drive. The guy will stare at you until you come back to reality.
#Just because a unit ''can'' be used in an article doesn't mean it has to be.
#Their use here is simply elitist box-ticking—not because they deepen the understanding of the topic.
#It is not up to this article to provide conversion factors between different units. The most commonly used unit is sufficient for the average reader to get their bearing/scale.
#There has been previous discussions on the use of the IEC units, and the consensus has been not to use them.
#I've worked in the IT industry for quite a while now, and I've never (that's right, never) come across the use of a single one of the IEC units. (That's just the opinion of one expert witness in case one was necessary.)
#If some mention need be made of such irrelevant terms, a footnote is more than sufficient.
The article is fine without mention of the terms. Those wanting to include the terms are doing so simply because they can, not because there is any compelling reason to do so. How about moving on to tackle the 100-kibi more important issues needing attention on WP?

:Yes indeed GFHandel, so much for the claims of consensus being for IEC prefixes. The problem is ask someone who wants to use IEC prefixes why they was to be inconsistent with other articles or the guideline. Then there is no reason given except "I want to" and here at Wikipedia that is not a good enough reason to add content because it goes against [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:NPOV]].

# [[WP:MOSNUM]] is a guideline, not policy.
# In the hatnote at the top of the MOSNUM page, it says: <i>"Use common sense in applying it; it will have occasional exceptions."</i> and links to [[WP:COMMON]] and to [[WP:IAR]].  
# WP:COMMON says in part: <i>"Wikipedia has many rules. Instead of following every rule, it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause loss of perspective, so there are times when it is better to ignore a rule. Even if a contribution "violates" the precise wording of a rule, it might still be a good contribution."</i>
# [[WP:COMPUNITS]], the section of MOSNUM that specifically deals with computer related units of measurements says in part: <i>"Specify if the binary or decimal meanings of K, M, G, etc. are intended as the primary meaning."</i>.  The table at question uses the SI units as primary, with the IEC units as secondary, therefore it's clearly permitted in the guideline.
# The archived discussion, referenced in MOSNUM, [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)/Archive/Complete rewrite of Units of Measurements (June 2008)|compete rewrite of UoM]], is almost three years old. The last three years is a blink of the eye relative to the field of Elizabethan literature, for example, but it's generations relative to computer technology.
# That archived discussion had about a dozen participants, not an atypical number when compared to the number of participants in AfDs. How can a claim be made that an extremely small subset of the community can set up a guideline for the entire community, when it can take that number of people just to delete or keep one single article. That is not a meaningful or reasonable community wide consensus.
# Regardless of how much weight one places on the discussion by a group of twelve editors from three years ago, consensus can change, per [[WP:CCC]].

Conclusion: The subject table with IEC units in a <i>secondary</i> position does not violate [[WP:MOSNUM]], per [[WP:COMPUNITS]] and [[WP:COMMON]]. — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 06:53, 9 April 2011 (UTC)

:No that is not the conclusion because using IEC prefixes in the secondary position still violates [[WP:MOSNUM]]. The correct method to disambiguate is to use numbers not any prefixes. Claiming MOSNUM says it is "clearly permitted in the guideline" to use IEC prefixes in the secondary position is wrong. It does not allow that at all. If you don't believe me then ask someone at [[WP:MOSNUM]]. Oh wait, that has already been done, the conclusion is not to use IEC prefixes. Wanting to use IEC prefixes here also violates [[WP:COMMON]] because common sense tells anyone that using prefixes that are not familiar and "have seen little use by the press or the computing industry" is not good for any article. In summary Becksguy your claims about what [[WP:MOSNUM]] allows are wrong. [[Special:Contributions/220.255.2.87|220.255.2.87]] ([[User talk:220.255.2.87|talk]]) 06:58, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
::I do not see ''anything'' on this page that you have written which is correct. It is obvious to anyone with knowledge of standard operating procedures here that IEC prefixes are not "banned", so this article is entitled to use them if there is a reason to do so. I assume (per AGF) that you are simply misunderstanding what a guideline is, despite its clear "generally followed" wording, but there is nothing at MOSNUM or its voluminous discussion pages which enforces usage here. Sure, it will be taken into account, and we get it: you don't want IEC prefixes. Indeed I would be speaking up against them too if anyone were suggesting that all the disk sizes be quoted in gibis or other gobbledygook, but that is not the topic of discussion.

:::I woke up this morning to a couple of emails asking to comment on this issue because I was one of the editors who worked on the original guideline text. As someone who worked on it for so long I have a long memory and unique knowledge of the intention behind the text which is all archived in the 16 or so binary prefix talk archives. It is correct to say IEC prefixes are in effect "''banned''" for this article. They are "''generally not to be used''" on Wikipedia and this also applies to the table that [[User:RaptorHunter|RaptorHunter]] wants to include in the article. The guideline clause which does allow IEC prefixes in an article does not apply to this article because it is not "''specifically about or explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes''". Accordingly the table should use "''bytes or bits, with clear indication of whether in binary or decimal base''". I prefer the style "''64 × 1024<sup>2</sup> bytes''" but any notation style can be used as long as IEC prefixes are not used. I have not read anything in this talk page that convinced me that there should be a special case for using IEC prefixes in this article. There is no value to using IEC prefixes in this article. To [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] and some others on this talk page who have made claims about the guideline: Speaking personally from the point of view of someone who put a lot of effort into the guideline over several years I find it alarming how so many incorrect conclusions can be made about the guideline text. At the time of writing we all thought it was very clear IEC prefixes are not to be used except in the most rare situations. Let me be clear, this article is not one of those rare situations so to claim the guideline allows IEC prefixes in this article is utterly wrong.

::::Where is the policy to back your opinions? I actually don't particularly care about the table under discussion, and in general I fully accept the idea that MOS is wonderful, but the policy misinformation and advocacy against this minor usage are irritating. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 09:51, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::I'm glad you asked. One relevant policy is [[WP:CON]] which describes the way consensus is reached. Applying that to [[WP:MOSNUM]] it can be seen from the archives how many editors took part in the debate over several years to form the consensus. Sanctions can be applied to editors who refuse to accept consensus ([[WP:disruptive editing]]). Another relevant policy is [[WP:NPOV]] because as explained in the talk archive an editor's personal desire to use IEC prefixes (when they are very obviously not familiar to the average Wikipedia reader) is not a neutral point of view, it is a biased point of view. From reading this talk archive what I see are a couple of editors who have a desire to use IEC prefixes for the table when others have already proposed alternatives (power notation style) that are not biased towards either the old or new prefix systems. Obviously the least biased system is more aligned to the goals of [[WP:NPOV]] which is why power notation style should be used to replace the IEC prefixes. There are a couple of other policies that are relevant and these are also explained in the talk archives. The general thrust of the argument is that while the IEC prefixes are not widely used (and they are still not, this is a fact); Then any attempt to force them to be used in general articles (of which this is one example) against the [[WP:MOSNUM]] consensus is in violation of [[WP:NPOV]] policy and can be seen as disruptive editing behaviour.

You, RaptorHunter don’t have to concede on this point; we can simply have a nice quick RFC here to see if the IEC prefixes are “specifically about or explicitly discussed”as MOSNUM requires (as is done on [[Megabyte]]) or if it is the obvious reality: using them in an “Oh… didn’cha know?”-fashion to describe capacity.<p>You can save your wind arguing that up is down; a simple RFC here will settle the issue.

My thoughts on the matter: 
* Point 1: [[WP:MOSNUM]] allows the use of IEC prefixes where they themselves are, if not the primary topic of discussion, at least a significant topic. But this ''article'' is not about IEC prefixes. The ''section in question'' is not about IEC prefixes. It is about the meanings of true SI prefixes as used by hard drive makers, compared to identical-looking prefixes with binary meanings ("customary binary prefixes", per [[Binary prefixes]]) as used by operating systems and by many other programs to show hard drive capacities. It is attempting to explain the discrepancy between these two measurements. And neither of those measurements (at least as seen by the vast majority of computer users) uses IEC prefixes. There is therefore no justification for their use here under the "specifically about or explicitly discussing" provision. 
* Point 1A: I agree that ''if'' the IEC prefixes were widely recognized, used, and understood, then they'd be appropriate to use in this context. Then they would be an aid to understanding the discrepancy. But that is not the case. 
* Point 1B: And if the IEC prefixes ''were'' widely recognized, used, and understood, then MOSNUM wouldn't say what it says about them and we wouldn't be having this discussion at all. In fact, we might not have any apparent discrepancies to explain. But in the meantime, WP is supposed to document the ''status quo'', not promote change. 
* Point 2: The fact that IEC prefixes were added to this little table (or even the paragraphs surrounding the table) does not provide an "out" for the previous point. That would be self-referential, using the disputed usage as justification for itself. (And I think claims in that direction border on the ludicrous.) To satisfy MOSNUM's requirement of "specifically about or explicitly discussing" requires context ''other than'' the usage in question. 
* Point 3: MOSNUM specifically calls out two other cases where IEC prefixes may be used: Where a majority of the references cited in the article use them, or (of course) when directly quoting a source that uses them. The usage under discussion here does not meet those requirements either. The "sources" here would be operating system displays and hard drive makers' marketing. Except for ''one'' Linux distribution (that has literally about 1% market share) and perhaps a double handful of applications and utilities, none of the above use IEC prefixes, so they cannot be used as a "source" that supports their usage here. So why include the IEC prefixes in the table? To do so does not help explain anything; rather it adds a point that needs further explanation! 
* Point 3A: Mac OS is also not using IEC prefixes for displays of e.g. memory sizes, not that that would be relevant to this article anyway. 
* Point 4: It is true that the lede at [[WP:MOSNUM]] allows for exceptions to the whole page, citing the "guideline" nature of the page as opposed to "policy." But I don't think that gives excuse to ignore the guideline just because some editor wants to. In my opinion, given the strong position at [[WP:MOSNUM]] against the general use of IEC prefixes, a compelling reason to use IEC prefixes must exist to properly invoke this very nonspecific "exceptions clause." Since the section can say everything it needs to say without using IEC prefixes, such reason does not exist here. 
* Point 5: I still don't think "1000 GB" and "931 GB" should appear in the same table row to represent the same number, at least not as the table is (was) annotated. But that issue can be fixed other ways (better annotations). Fact is, HD boxes do say "1000 GB" and the OS will say "931 GB" for the same drive, and that needs to be explained. I think the answer is not binary prefixes, but better annotations. In fact, I'm creating a differently-formatted table to put in the [[Binary prefixes]] article specifically to address this issue. 

Please note that I am not ''at all'' an opponent of the IEC prefixes. In the past, in fact, I argued against the adoption of MOSNUM's current stance on this topic. Since then, though, I have realized that MOSNUM's position is the correct one for Wikipedia, given IEC prefixes' almost complete ''lack'' of adoption in the real world. It is not the job of an encyclopedia to promote what some editors think are good ideas; it is the job of an encyclopedia to document information that exists in reliable sources. Yes, exceptions to MOSNUM are permitted, but such exceptions must have justification and consensus. I haven't seen any compelling justification for an exception here, and there clearly is a lack of consensus in that direction. The proper action is therefore to comply with MOSNUM. (p.s.: Yes, I opined otherwise previously. After further thought, I've concluded that I was wrong.) [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 20:34, 9 April 2011 (UTC)

===RFC on the use of the IEC prefixes===

With regard to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=423180773#Capacity the table here in “Hard disk drive”,] is the use of the IEC binary measures and their symbols such as GiB ''“specifically about or explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes”'' as is required by [[Wikipedia:Mosnum#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits|MOSNUM:Quantities of bytes and bits]], or are they being used to describe the magnitude of binary quantities? Is such use '''compliant''' or '''in violation'''? If you find it to be in violation of MOSNUM but to still be a sound technical writing practice worthy of exemption from MOSNUM’s guidelines, please elaborate. If you find this use here in this fashion to be compliant with MOSNUM, please elaborate. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 15:18, 9 April 2011 (UTC) 

* '''In violation''' This isn’t  “explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes” as exemplified at [[Megabyte]] and [[Binary prefixes]], and is simply using them to describe a binary quantity, which is ''specifically'' prohibited by MOSNUM precisely because terminology like “gibibyte (GiB)” isn’t used in the real world (computer manufacturers and computer magazines) when communicating to a general-interest readership. The overwhelming consensus of the Wikipedia community when the applicable MOSNUM guideline was debated (a three-month-long process) was that the IEC prefixes were unfamiliar to our readership. They still are. Since Wikipedia simply follows the practices of RSs, the use of these units in this fashion is poor technical writing practice and is—not surprisingly—entirely contrary to the guidelines of MOSNUM.  [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 15:18, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
* '''Compliant'''
:Per [[Wikipedia:MOSNUM#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits]]: One of the exceptions for binary prefixes is:
:" in articles specifically about '''or explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes'''. "
:This table compares SI and binary prefixes. That counts as "explicitly discussing" it. Saying that 1000 TB = 931 TB is just confusing. For the purpose of this table, it makes much more sense to use binary prefixes for comparison purposes: 1000 TB = 931 TiB 
:It has even been suggested that we replace the words [[binary prefix]] with [[binary prefix|in the binary sense]], which of course links back to [[binary prefix]]. This euphemism is nothing more than obtuse language to avoid talking about [[binary prefixes]]. It sounds like little more than a case of [[Wikipedia:I just don't like it]] This issue has been brought up again and again in the courts and the tech media. The table clarifies for our readers why a 1000 TB hard drive only has 931 TB.

*'''Deceptive''' 
To simply state that binary quantities may be reported as a certain number of GiB is deceptive in that few sources (including operating systems) actually report hard disk capacities using that symbol, especially when one considers that consumers of such information will read the used or unused capacity of a drive much more frequently that the capacity of a new drive, and (so far as I know) operating systems do not use the IEC symbols to report used or unused capacity.

:*Or, we do as is done everywhere else on Wikipedia to address the dual meaning of “GB”: we write that in some contexts, such as the capacity of RAM, it means 1,073,741,824 bytes (1024<sup>3</sup>) and in others “GB” means 1,000,000,000 bytes. What is ''not'' done is to have Wikipedia expressing these quantities using terminology that is soundly being ignored by the computer industry; that much is part of ''Technical Writing 101''. Our three-year-long experiment trying to be all futuristic and use the terminology here on Wikipedia in hopes that the idea would catch on and everyone will become familiar with the units of measure and the computer industry will follow suit was proven to be a pipe dream by idealistic, wide-eyed futurists.

* '''In violation''' (and not appropriate). The MOSNUM explicitly states "''...decimal definition in an article on [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]]...''". The IEC prefixes are not used in practice to describe the size of hard disk drives, and their use in this article can only serve to confuse the average readership. There are many links in the article (e.g. [[SI prefix]], [[Gigabyte]]) that lead the interested reader to tables of conversions between the different units (and this article doesn't need to provide another one). For other reasons why using the IEC prefixes in this article is not a good idea, please see my post above. <font style="color:Navy;background:#C2D1F0;font-family:Arial;" size="2">&nbsp;[[User:GFHandel|GFHandel]]</font><font style="color:Navy;background:#C2D1F0;font-family:Arial;text-decoration:blink;" size="2">[[User_talk:GFHandel|.]] &nbsp;</font> 20:27, 9 April 2011 (UTC)

* '''In Violation'''.  Per Greg L but with a few comments of my own.

::::::Exactly. Ubuntu is written ''by'' space cadets, ''for'' space cadets. Those people already know this stuff anyway. This article is written for a ''general-interest'' readership, not for Wesley Crusher in the year 2350. With the exception of space-cadet OS, Jeh is 99 times more correct than RaptorHunter. All the major computer OSs don’t mention KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB. They either typically say {{xt|1=1&nbsp;TB* (*&thinsp;1&nbsp;TB = one terabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes, actual formatted capacity is less)}} or they say {{xt|Actual formatted capacity: 986,710,016 bytes.}} No computer manufacturer or hard drive manufacturer when communicating to a general-interest readership (consumer) is using the IEC prefixes. Arguments that “931&nbsp;GB” is somehow explained by saying “It’s 931&nbsp;GiB” is either galactic cluelessness over how to do technical writing or, more likely, grasping at logical straws in hopes no one here will notice. The actual way one would explain this supposed “931 dilemma” is along the lines of {{xt|One terabyte equals 1,073,741,824 bytes (1024<sup>3</sup> bytes) in some contexts (typically memory such as RAM), and in other contexts can mean 1,000,000,000 bytes (typically storage such as hard disk drives. It doesn’t really matter much except to Wikipedians who don’t have a life and argue on talk pages.}} All but that last sentence is clearly covered on MOSNUM.

I started this RfC because debating this with RaptorHunter was like some sort of electronic feedback loop that could go on forever. I’ve seen that when editors insist “up” is “down” and “''mentioning'' the IEC prefixes in a table amounts to directly discussing them”, there no point arguing. I’ve seen that when some editors don’t get their way in an AfD (article for deletion) and when it fails, they go tag-bomb the article, the best thing is to not argue or editwar over the tag. The best thing is just to ''(*sigh*)'' and do an RfC and when the results are in, revert to the community consensus. Sometimes the smart ones go on to something else. Others continue to editwar and get blocked or banned. But the only way these things are ever settled is by just having an RfC and be done with the nonsense.

I note that Fnagaton hasn’t even weighed in and we all know full well how he will !vote. Then the community consensus will be quite clear: MOSNUM correctly has the proper guideline and this stunt was an attempt at circuitous, self-referential logic to circumvent the obvious.

I'm AGF that there was no intent to push this RfC in any particular direction. Neutral "canvasing" occurs when all editors are asked for input, which is why I added the <nowiki>{{RFC}}</nowiki> tag to open up this discussion to a wider audience. I fully accept Fnagaton's statement that the email requests were neutral and intended to "broaden discussion", and withdraw the comment. Yes, these discussions are not votes, yet I sometimes see comments in RfC and XfD discussions effectively counting how many editors support vs oppose. So there is some tendency to headcount even though we are not supposed to. This is not about sanctioning anyone, or accusing anyone, just about increased transparency. However, in retrospect, I should have just asked Fnagaton, who has gained considerable respect in my eyes, about the emails on his talk page. It would have saved a boatload of wikidrama.

What part of "use the decimal definition in an article on hard drives" is so hard to understand?<br />
Here is how crazy capacity claims can get:<br />
A 3.5" floppy disk holds 1,474,560 bytes.<br />
If you assume K=1,000 and M=1,000,000 (1,000x1,000), that's 1.47MB.<br />
If you assume K=1,024 and M=1,048,576 (1,024x1,024), that's 1.40MB.<br />
Only by making an "M" by multiplying 1,000x1,024 (1024,000) do you get 1.44MB.<br />

This RFC is for use with hard disk drives and that industry has explicitly rejected the IEC binary prefixes.

== Let's not lie to the readers ==

Could we at least have a version of the table that doesn't say something that is on the face of it stupid, like 1 terabyte = 0.905 terabytes? Or are we so used to clicking on "Start" to shut down the computer that we no longer care abuot the lies on the screen? Logical machines, these. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 14:03, 11 April 2011 (UTC)
:Nobody on this page has suggested using "1 terabyte = 0.905 terabytes". A table was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hard_disk_drive&diff=422947845&oldid=422938970 proposed] that was less confusing than the IEC prefixes version but was rejected by someone because it didn't use IEC prefixes.

:: Sorry but I think that table is horrible. I think the original table is horrible too. "Here are the different ways of expressing one terabyte" is not a particularly useful thing to present here, as this article is not about "the terabyte". It's about hard drives. Furthermore, just as very few users will ever see one terabyte expressed as "931 KiB", very few will ever see it expressed as "1000000 megabytes" or "1000000000 kilobytes". [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 16:34, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

I also think both tables don't work. Either we design a new table that's acceptable to the different camps, and is actually useful for our readers, or do with text only in the capacity section of the article, using RS in either case. Despite my position that the table is MOSNUM compliant, since IEC Units of Measure (UoM) isn't the primary usage, my major concern is that the table has the logical absurdity of saying that 1000 GB = 931 GB, using exactly the same UoM. If we can get around that somehow, without using IEC units, I'm happy. When I first saw the table, I thought that using IEC units was a neat way of avoiding the 1000 = 931 problem, but I'm not an advocate for the usage of IEC units in WP. I think there is potentially some merit in the position that most general readers probably won't know what they mean. In any case that's an issue to revisit at MOSNUM, not here. However, most general readers will probably also not intuitively understand scientific notation or powers of ten notation either. I think Jeh is absolutely right in saying that  <i>... this article is not about "the terabyte".</i> An IEC free section that actually helps reader understanding also has the absolutely wonderful effect of making this whole brouhaha become moot, at least here. On a side note, I still don't quite understand how this became a hot button issue here. Using IEC units just isn't worth the drama, angst, user blocks, gallons of virtual ink, and edit wars. Nice postings, Jeh. — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 18:30, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

: The only mathematically correct way to write this equation would be use distinct dimensional units, e.g. <math>1000\ \overline{\mathrm{GB}} \approx 931\ \widehat{\mathrm{GB}}</math>, where <math>\overline{\mathrm{GB}} = 1000^3\ \mathrm{B}</math> and <math>\widehat{\mathrm{GB}} = 1024^3\ \mathrm{B}</math>. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 20:23, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

::::: Can this explanation really not be done without using IEC prefixes? If you do use IEC prefixes, then since literally 99% of the OSs on desktops and laptops do not display using IEC prefixes, how is this helpful?  My opinion is that anyone who understands IEC prefixes won't be in need of any such explanation. I agree that the IEC prefixes would be helpful to the explanation ''if they were understood by the general readership''. The case has not at all been made that they are so understood.

It should therefore be discussed right here, in this article, not somewhere else. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 23:47, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

{{od}}Or Wikipedia can communicate to our readership ''precisely'' as the computer industry has been doing for years, e.g. the following:

{{xt|1=Terminology like gigabyte (GB) is ambiguous as it means slightly different values depending on the application. For many uses, such as computer memory (RAM), 1&nbsp;GB equals 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes, which is 1,073,741,824 bytes. For other uses, notably storage such as hard disk drives and even solid-state drives (SSDs),  1&nbsp;GB equals 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes, which is 1,000,000,000 bytes.}}

That this sort of approach is the one [[Wikipedia:MOSNUM#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits|recommended by MOSNUM]] ‘twas no accident; it avoids confusing our readership with terminology they will only see here and won’t remember after they leave our pages.

Someone on this page wrote as follows:

{{xt|One of the exceptions for binary prefixes is:

" in articles specifically about '''or explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes'''. "

This table compares SI and binary prefixes. That counts as "explicitly discussing" it.}}

Well, the editor may'' think'' that is what the community had in mind when it adopted that MOSNUM guideline, but the community obviously had in mind articles such as [[Binary prefix]] and [[Megabyte]]. The MOSNUM guidance the community adopted is exceedingly explicit on how to describe the magnitude of binary quantities with advise and examples as follows (note how the given examples include hard drives):

<hr/>
* Disambiguation should be shown in bytes or bits, with clear indication of whether in binary or decimal base. There is no preference in the way to indicate the number of bytes and bits, but the notation style should be consistent within an article. Acceptable examples include:
*:{{xt|A 64&nbsp;MB ({{nowrap|64 × 1024<sup>2</sup> bytes)}} video card and a 100&nbsp;GB ({{nowrap|100 × 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes)}} hard drive}}
*:{{xt|A 64&nbsp;MB ({{nowrap|64 × 2<sup>20</sup> bytes)}} video card and a 100&nbsp;GB {{nowrap|({{val|100|e=9|u=bytes}})}} hard drive}}
*:{{xt|A 64&nbsp;MB (67,108,864&nbsp;bytes) video card and a 100&nbsp;GB (100,000,000,000&nbsp;bytes) hard drive}}
<hr/>

Just three editors are the shepherding authors behind our article “[[Timeline of binary prefixes]]”. One of them wrote here as follows: {{xt|The software industry has been misappropriating SI prefixes to mean something they don't for decades. The ideal solution of course would be for software makers to actually use SI prefixes correctly, just like hard drive manufactures are now.}} Such editors believe the world would be far better off if the computer industry better embraced the use of the IEC prefixes so that terms like GB don’t have two different meanings. But the computing world hasn’t embraced them. Wikipedia follows the majority of the RSs. If you go into a computer store, you won’t find memory upgrades marked as “1 GiB SIM card”.

As for the IEC prefixes being a recommendation of a standards body, that doesn’t matter at all. The BIPM—the mother of all standards bodies and the one behind our current incarnation of the metric system, the SI—has steadfastly insisted that a space is ''always'' inserted between the numeric value of a quantity and the unit symbol and that this applies to the percent symbol (%) just as it does to the meter symbol (m). Thus, according to the BIPM, one properly writes {{xt|75&nbsp;%}} and not {{xt|75%}}. Regardless that this is consistent and logical and recommended by the mother of all standards bodies, Wikipedia follows the practices observed by the way the real world works. Even though the use of {{xt|75&nbsp;%}} would likely not confuse anyone and using this style would be futuristic, logically consistent, and compliant with a respected standards body, we don’t use it. And ''that'' is over a mere issue of ''*style*'' over which readers would easily recognize the measure and understand its meaning; it isn’t something much more substantive like a unit of measure that exceedingly few readers have seen before and will likely never see again after they leave our pages. Seriously… that’s really against the fundamentals of ''Technical Writing 101''. That “kibibyte” is a swell idea isn’t sufficient to offset this colossal shortcoming.

It’s just that simple. We follow the advise of MOSNUM and we follow the majority of most-reliable RSs. With precious little if any exception, the hard drive industry and the operating system industry (Ubuntu at 1% being the exception) and the computer industry and the aftermarket RAM industry doesn’t use the IEC prefixes. So we don’t either. That is a bedrock principal of Wikipedia. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 23:42, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

:OK, how about we recast the section to be a summary section for the [[Binary prefix]] article per [[WP:SUMMARY]]. Write one paragraph without IEC units and without a table, but that abstracts the dichotomy by saying just essentially that HDDs are advertised and packaged as one size (e.g. 1 TB), and reported as various sizes, and linking the readers to the main article, SUMMARY style. Something like what Greg L suggested above that starts with: "Terminology like gigabyte (GB) is ambiguous...". In the [[Binary prefix]] article there is a whole section with five paragraphs about the decimal vs binary capacity issue in HDDs. In other words, here we get: no tables, no IEC units, no unnecessary verbiage and explanations, no 1000 = 931, and no squabbling. — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 00:12, 12 April 2011 (UTC)
::Dude. That’s fine.

I do think "gibibyte" should be mentioned in the section or else we've got an NPOV problem since multiple RS's do use the term.  Most of all I believe that the idea here is to describe the topic as clearly as possible, using or not using binary prefixes as the article editors see fit.  The recommendations of MOSNUM should be taken on board but MOSNUM does not have absolute authority.  As it says in the infobox at the top of the MOSNUM page: "Use common sense in applying it; it will have occasional exceptions."  It's up to the editors of this talkpage whether the affected section of this article should be one of those occasional exceptions.<p>Note that whether SIM cards are advertised as "1 GiB" is immaterial; the RS's to follow most closely are the ones narrowly specific to the topic at hand, not the whole wide universe of data capacity specifications.  The topic at hand is explaining the disparity between "1TB hard drive" (written on the outside of the box) and "937 GB" (reported as the same drive's capacity by OS software).  There are tons of RS about that topic and a lot of them '''do''' explain it in terms of gibibytes.  My own attitude towards binary prefixes is I've seen them used on occasion, they seem a bit precisionistic in most contexts since one can usually figure out what type of "GB" is actually intended.  But this is one of the places where precision is required.  Beckguy's suggestion of kicking "GiB" off to the binary prefix article is well-meaning but sub-optimal, since it is notable reference info about hard drives rather than merely being about binary units.  So it belongs in the hard drive article.  Ruud has explained it pretty well. [[Special:Contributions/75.57.242.120|75.57.242.120]] ([[User talk:75.57.242.120|talk]]) 02:26, 12 April 2011 (UTC)
:::* The test isn’t that ''some'' hits come up on Google that mention the IEC prefixes; <u>of ''course''</u> they are going to be there. The test is what the “majority of reliable RSs” do. This advise is repeated right in [[Wikipedia:Mosnum#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits|MOSNUM’s guidance]] on expressing quantities of bytes and bits, where it states that we may use such terminology {{xt|when the article is on a topic where the majority of cited sources use the IEC prefixes}}. Clearly this is not the case; not by a long shot because the imbalance is wildly disproportionate against the IEC prefixes. So to avoid running afoul with [[WP:WEIGHT]], we simply follow mainstream practices. The use of the IEC prefixes should be most prevalent amongst manufacturers and retailers of RAM, yet [http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%221GiB%22+RAM&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 "1GiB" RAM] produces 128,000 hits and [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=%221GB%22+RAM&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&oq= "1GB" RAM] produces 14.3 ''million'' hits, including all manufacturers and distributors of RAM. If we didn’t have [[WP:WEIGHT]] as a bedrock principle, our [[Apollo 11]] article would talk about how “''Most'' experts believe Apollo&nbsp;11 was when men walked on the Moon” in order to allow for the conspiracy theorists, which is something like ''20% of Americans'', which is far in excess of the 0.9% of Google hits in IEC-prefix example.

::::*We're not talking about RAM, we're talking about hard drives, and specifically we're talking about a narrow topic within the subject of hard drives.  What do the majority of RS's about that narrow topic say?  Have you checked?  Comparing NIST-recognized units to moon landing conspiracies isn't persuasive.  There's no facts in dispute here; it's just a question of the clearest way to write the exposition.  GiB isn't fringe.  It may be minority but in that case it should still be represented per NPOV (i.e. with some citations like the ones I gave above).  Fwiw, the article's description of why hard drive capacity uses decimal figures is itself uncited and looks more OR-ish than the gibibyte thing, from what I can tell, and a lot of the "binary prefix timeline" looks OR-ish too.

== Replace table with this paragraph: ==

A one terabyte (1 TB) disk drive would be expected to hold at least 1000 GB with a GB defined to equal 1,000,000,000 bytes; and indeed most 1 TB hard drives will contain slightly more than this number. However some operating system utilities would report this as around 931 GB or 953,674 MB with a GB defined to equal 1024^3 or 1,073,741,824 bytes. To alleviate confusion, a new standard has been put forward by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] that would refer unambiguously to powers of 1024 with special [[binary prefixes]]. In this system 1024^3 or 1,073,741,824 bytes equals 1 GiB and 1000^3 or 1,000,000,000 bytes equals 1GB. However, as of 2011 adoption has been slow and usage has been limited in the marketplace and in the press.

If we try to include IEC units in the summary paragraph, then we will still have content that is contentious, just a shorter version of it. The whole point of the suggestion for a summary section is to avoid the contentious content. One editor suggested that it's "sub-optimal" and I can't disagree. But it's better than the disruption we been having, and if it doesn't work, toss it out and try something else. We should not mention IEC or it's units at all, since all that is in the [[Binary prefix]] article. The shear amount of disruption over this issue totally overwhelms any possible benefit in using IEC units in this article, since we can describe the capacity issue without using them. I think it speaks volumes that two established editors came in supporting the inclusion of IEC units, but have switched. I also think it's amazing that we are actually collaborating here.

== Proposed new section and table ==

[[Image:Hard drive capacity over time.svg|right|thumb|[[personal computer|PC]] hard disk drive capacity (in [[gigabytes|GB]]) over time. The vertical axis is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], so the fit line corresponds to [[exponential growth]].]]

===Capacity measurements===
Hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in  multiples of [[SI prefix|SI]]-standard powers of 1000, where a ''terabyte'' is 1000 gigabytes and a ''gigabyte'' is 1000 megabytes.<ref>i.e. see [http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/B259B4A73296DA628625751600058A80/$file/ProductBrochureMarch2009.pdf HGST], [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/faqView.do?b2b_bbs_msg_id=167 Samsung], [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/storage_solutions_guide.pdf Seagate], [http://sdd.toshiba.com/techdocs/MKxx33GSG_MK1235GSL_r1.pdf Toshiba] and [http://www.wdc.com/en/library/2579-001028.pdf Western Digital] websites</ref> Many operating systems and utilities &ndash; including Microsoft Windows, Apple's MacOS X prior to version 10.6, and Ubuntu &ndash; report hard disk capacity in powers of 1024, where a ''terabyte'' is 1024 gigabytes and a ''gigabyte'' is 1024 megabytes. Therefore available space appears less than advertised capacity. The relative difference between the two capacity measurements increases logarithmically with the capacity of the hard disk. The actual number for a formatted capacity will be somewhat smaller still, [[comparison of file systems|depending on the file system]].

The discrepancy between the two methods of reporting sizes had financial consequences for at least two hard drive manufacturers when a [[class action suit]] argued the different methods effectively misled consumers (see ''[[Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation]]'' and ''[[Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.]]'').<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,201269,00.html Western Digital Settles Hard-Drive Capacity Lawsuit, Associated Press June 28, 2006 retrieved 2010 Nov 25</ref><ref>[http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/10/26/seagate_lawsuit_concludes_settlement_announced/1 Seagate lawsuit concludes, settlement announced], bit-tech.net</ref>

Starting in about 1998, a number of standards and trade organizations approved standards and recommendations for a new set of [[binary prefix]]es, proposed earlier by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), that would refer unambiguously to powers of 1024. According to these, the SI prefixes would only be used in the decimal sense, even when referring to data storage capacities. As of 2011 they have seen little adoption in the computer industry. Microsoft Windows reports disk and file sizes using customary binary prefixes, Apple MacOS X switched to decimal SI prefixes in version 10.6. and Ubuntu uses the IEC binary prefixes.

Not good. It includes IEC prefixes which do not have consensus. Not to mention it includes more confusing table that duplicates the work found in [[binary prefixes]] section "Deviation between powers of 1024 and powers of 1000". Basically just remove the whole section, add a small paragraph and link to [[binary prefixes]] is much better. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 10:55, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

'''Oppose'''. IEC units have been introduced (against consensus). Progress was being made in rewriting the paragraphs, so using a table is an unwanted and backward step. The table is bizarre as it makes it look like the world has three major OSs: Apple, Windows, and Ubuntu. The lack of references for any of the data in the table is poor. So the Apple column only refers to 10.6, but the Windows column is universal? I was feeling a little down today, but this amateurish and transparent attempt to push a cause (using Ubuntu instead of Linux is priceless) has given me a laugh and perked me right back up again.

'''Oppose'''  Clearly a contrivance that shoehorns reality to the side too aggressively in order to “get those units in there somehow.” If one were to objectively approach that last one (Ubuntu), it would just say “Linux” and the units would read “varies”. I see our own [[Usage share of operating systems]] mentions Linux and it bifurcates that into “mainstream” and “Android”. This outside article, [http://www.astahost.com/info.php/Guide-Linux-Flavours_t1812.html A Guide To Linux Flavours] lists quite a number of different flavors, as follows: [http://www.redhat.com/ Redhat,] [http://www.fedoracore.org/community/ Fedora,] [http://www.mandrakesoft.com/ Mandrake,] [http://download.novell.com/patch/finder/ Suse] (by Novel), [http://www.debian.org/ Debian,] [http://www.knoppix.org/ Knoppix,] [http://www.mepis.org/ Mepis,], [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] ('''there''' it is), [http://www.slackware.com/ Slackware,] [http://college.ch/linux/ Collage Linux], and ''(*sigh*)'' [http://www.gentoo.org/ Gentoo.] Given that all of Linux totals around 2%, slipping the ol’ '''Ubuntu®™©''' seems quite the contrivance. The sensible thing to do here is dump it because it comprises cherry-picked flavors of the highly fragmented Linux cloud. Everyone else’s computers are just reporting KB, MB, and GB. Even'' Apples iOS'' for iPads and iPhones has a greater share than all of Linux combined. So…

The addition of two flavors of Linux in this table, when Linux in total is around 2% of the OS market, is unwise, cherry-picked, and it’s obvious why.

It’s simple: the majority of the citations in the hard drive article don’t use the IEC prefixes. The vast majority of the hard drive manufacturers themselves don’t. To wedge these virtually unheard-of units into such an article by riding the coat tails of Ubuntu is transparent and not in keeping with the bedrock principal of “follow the majority of most-reliable modern RSs for the discipline.” ''(I revised this after Ruud’s comment, below)'' [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 00:21, 13 April 2011 (UTC)

I told him how this article was an old holdout that slipped beneath the radar years ago when the issue was settled on MOSNUM and how the principals had run off to work on articles ''about'' the IEC prefixes, such as [[Timeline of binary prefixes]]. He responded “Where they can write how ‘This is what it '''''was'''''’.”

Unfortunately, he doesn’t have any of his Linux machines at home this evening. His triple-boot Mac uses Ubuntu and a computing brick he is programming to use as an industrial control device uses Debian. First observation from him: Linux traces its roots to well before the IEC prefixes were even proposed so—at least for the most part—the kernel-level stuff uses the conventional prefixes. Also, Linux in all its carnations runs on a huge variety of hard drive file systems (HFS, ext2, etc.). He has been partially sensitized to the mebibyte ''(*sigh*… the built-in spell checker in Safari flagged one of those prefixes with a dashed-red underline)'' because he uses Wikipedia and used to encounter the Porky Pig stutters. And he knows me and knows about the MOSNUM jihads and suicide bombers and all. So he is sensitized to the issue and notices the IEC prefixes when he encounters them in Linux—which isn’t often at all. To his recollection, in virtually call cases, he sees the standard decimal prefixes being used for reporting free memory as well as storage capacity. He added that it depends upon what tool one uses to work on a hard drive. For instance, if one uses a command-line partition editor, it reports using “KB” and “MB”, etc. But he does recall seeing an instance of the IEC prefixes being used and it was a GUI-based partition editor.

When I told him that some sort of Ubuntu place was saying that official policy was to use the IEC prefixes in the future, he asked who (thinking it some discussion group). So I came here to this page to look up [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy Ubuntu.com’s Units Policy] and told him who it was. He said “Oh. The guy who started Ubuntu is that South African internet mogul who is so rich, he bought a ride on Soyuz to the Space Station. Yeah, he’s out to change the world.”

But, in a nutshell, it is '''''soooo''''' very misleading to say that “Ubuntu” uses the IEC prefixes. That’s like saying “People in Mississippi use bad grammar.” It’s probably worse than that; for the ''majority'' of user-interface things to which users of current installations of Ubuntu are being exposed, they aren’t seeing the IEC prefixes.

It’s time to slam-dunk this one. They IEC prefixes have absolutely no excuse for being in this article. This “Ubuntu” thing was apparently all predicated on a Web site showing where the South African guy ''wants'' Ubuntu to go in the future; that’s all.

== Proposed new section and table (2) ==

[[Image:Hard drive capacity over time.svg|right|thumb|[[personal computer|PC]] hard disk drive capacity (in [[gigabytes|GB]]) over time. The vertical axis is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], so the fit line corresponds to [[exponential growth]].]]

===Capacity measurements===
Hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in  multiples of 1000, where a ''terabyte'' is 1000 gigabytes and a ''gigabyte'' is 1000 megabytes.<ref>i.e. see [http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/B259B4A73296DA628625751600058A80/$file/ProductBrochureMarch2009.pdf HGST], [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/faqView.do?b2b_bbs_msg_id=167 Samsung], [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/whitepaper/storage_solutions_guide.pdf Seagate], [http://sdd.toshiba.com/techdocs/MKxx33GSG_MK1235GSL_r1.pdf Toshiba] and [http://www.wdc.com/en/library/2579-001028.pdf Western Digital] websites</ref> Many operating systems and utilities &ndash; including [[Microsoft Windows]] and Apple's [[MacOS X]] prior to version 10.6 &ndash; report hard disk capacity in multiples of 1024, where a ''terabyte'' is 1024 gigabytes and a ''gigabyte'' is 1024 megabytes. Therefore available space appears less than advertised capacity. The relative difference between the two capacity measurements increases logarithmically with the capacity of the hard disk. The actual number for a formatted capacity will be somewhat smaller still, [[comparison of file systems|depending on the file system]].

The discrepancy between the two methods of reporting sizes had financial consequences for at least two hard drive manufacturers when a [[class action suit]] argued the different methods effectively misled consumers (see ''[[Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation]]'' and ''[[Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.]]'').<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,201269,00.html Western Digital Settles Hard-Drive Capacity Lawsuit, Associated Press June 28, 2006 retrieved 2010 Nov 25</ref><ref>[http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/10/26/seagate_lawsuit_concludes_settlement_announced/1 Seagate lawsuit concludes, settlement announced], bit-tech.net</ref>

Starting in about 1998, a number of standards and trade organizations approved standards and recommendations for a new set of [[binary prefix|prefixes for binary multiples]], proposed earlier by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), that would refer unambiguously to multiples of 1024. According to these, the SI prefixes would only be used for decimal multiples, even when referring to data storage capacities. As of 2011 they have seen little adoption in the computer industry. Microsoft Windows continues to reports disk and file sizes using SI prefixes for binary multiples, while Apple's MacOS X switched to decimal multiples in version 10.6,<ref>http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2419</ref> with Ubuntu planning to do so as well.<ref>https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy</ref>

* '''Meh. Whatever.''' There are no IEC prefixes, which addresses the issue at hand. The rest if window dressing. I changed the delimiting to the conventional format used on Wikipedia. Yes, thinspaces are *allowed* on Wikipedia but they are most suited for “scientific articles”, which was a concession for those who love thinspaces and want to use them on every article that seems “sciencey” to Sarah Palin. For this article, we follow the majority of the RSs for guidance. Even the space-cadets at Ubuntu [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy (Units Policy)] use the conventional way of delimiting numbers (commas). Yes, it could be argued that hard drives are designed by scientists, but this isn’t an article directed to readers of science journals; it’s directed to a general-interest readership.

{{od}} '''To all editors on this page''': see my 03:17, 13 April 2011 (UTC), above. In a nutshell, it is not a factual statement to say “Ubuntu uses the IEC prefixes.” Only some tools do.

When you consider that the kernel underling Linux, which is at the bottom of Ubuntu, was written when everyone used only the decimal prefixes (before the IEC proposal), and when you consider that all the flavors of Linux ''combined'' enjoy ~2% of the O.S. share, which is less representation than iOS, and when you consider that there are ''dozens'' of flavors of Linux out there, only one of which is Ubuntu, and when you consider that command-line partitioning tools show the decimal prefixes for storage capacity and only some GUI-tools on Ubuntu (notably or a particular disk partitioning tool) use the IEC prefixes, the use of the IEC prefixes to describe the storage space available on hard drives is such a small subset of the universe of hard drive capacity-reporting, the chart here in this article would have to be three feet wide denoting practices down to the hundredth of a percentile point to capture nuances this fine. ''That?'' To get IEC prefixes into the chart?

It is only because of galactic tendentiousness that this issue has persisted for so long. It’s time to stop horsing around; every guideline and bedrock principal of Wikipedia as well as half a dozen principles from ''Technical Writing 101'' have to be flouted to pull off this feat of magic. The IEC prefixes have no business in this article in any shape or form. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 04:12, 13 April 2011 (UTC)

I couldn’t afford all that stuff and was computing full-ghetto back then. That was a long time ago, darn near the beginning of that graph. <u>Who here on this page goes back further than that and recalls coveting a hard drive that had less capacity than the Hyperdrive</u>?<p>Oh, uhmm… since the last count, when the post-count on this page was 47-43 / advantage RaptorHunter, the score is now 50-44 with RaptorHunter ''pulling away!''

*'''Comment''' The table can be made narrower by writing 10<sup>11</sup> instead of 100,000,000,000 and so forth.  I still favor IEC prefixes based on the sources I looked at the other night.  I'd be interested in seeing some examples of sources on the same topic that don't use them (google hit counts based on pages about different topics are irrelevant).  The term "SI prefix" should IMO also not be used without citation to an RS saying it's an SI prefix.  Prefixes like K for kilo have been around since long before the [[Système international]] was created in 1960, and describing informal uses (like on HD packaging) as SI units without explicit sourcing seems to me like [[wp:SYNTH|original synthesis]].  For example, WDC's [[advanced format]] technology information sheet[http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/WhitePapers/ENG/2579-771430.pdf] describes the capacity of an advanced format sector as 4K, meaning 4096 bytes, not 4000.  In other words they use prefixes like "K" both ways, as most of us knew all along.  Similarly, the "20MB Hyperdrive" Greg mentions appears to be an approx 21.6 million byte drive based on some googling.  [[Special:Contributions/69.111.194.167|69.111.194.167]] ([[User talk:69.111.194.167|talk]]) 08:25, 13 April 2011 (UTC)

:* Referring to "SI units" as original synthesis: In a way it is, since SI does not define any units for quantities of information. However SI does state that the ''prefixes'' defined in SI can be used with non-SI units for such cases. Hence "SI prefixes." Now HD makers are pretty damn universal in stating "1 GB = one billion bytes," or perhaps "1,000,000,000 bytes" - it's not just on their packaging. If referring to that usage as an "SI prefix" is "original synthesis" then so is just about everything on WP that isn't a direct quotation from source. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 16:07, 13 April 2011 (UTC)

* I changed “decimal prefixes” and “binary prefixes” in the above table to “decimal math” and “binary math” since the distinction isn’t the ''prefixes''—which stay the same for 99.9 percent of users—but is a distinction of the math underlying the meaning of the conventional prefixes.

RaptorHunter's recent editing pattern has been nothing but tendentious and bizarre.

It's time to bring this debate to a conclusion, and I've [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Unstable_behavior_by_User:RaptorHunter|sought]] help to achieve that. BTW RaptorHunter, the vandalism you recently performed (twice) on Jimbo Wales' page was especially disturbing—as was your justification for doing it.<br /><br />

A table is a lazy way of explaining this issue, so let's continue with the good progress made with the descriptive paragraphs, and get this finalised.<br />

* All arguments offered up by the proponents of the use of the IEC prefixes here to describe hard drive capacity haven’t withstood even a cursory inspection. Their use on the table in the [[Hard disk drive]] article persisted as long they did merely because of tendentiousness. Their use in that table in that manner was clearly intended to highlight and help promote wider adoption of the IEC prefixes in the computing world and the proponents own words here show that they have a great disdain for the current ambiguous nature of terms like “GB” and greatly believe in the virtue of the IEC prefixes. However, Wikipedia follows the way the real world works and is not to be used as a means of advocacy of all-things-cool.<p>Wikipedia’s three-year-long attempt at using instances of “The Dell Inspiron 1501 originally came with 256&nbsp;MiB or RAM” only confused readers and clearly accomplished nothing insofar as getting the world to follow our wise lead. That sort of terminology came about because a ''single'' editor—nearly overnight—managed to revise ''hundreds'' of articles and a small cabal lead by a rogue admin prevented all those edits from being reverted. At least two holdouts from the MOSNUM battle that ended that unwise practice settled on this article, which they have used as their final stand for two years.

{{outdent}} While [[User:Jeh|Jeh]], [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] and others talk about "consensus" at MOSNUM it is only fair to point out that there are more editors in favor of use of IEC Binary Digits in this article than achieved the so-called consensus at MOSNUM and that the so-called consensus was achieved by a small group of editors in the face of an immediately prior consensus by a larger group of editors, 11 to 1 as I recall, that IEC Binary prefixes not be deprecated.  I think we all agree that “The Dell Inspiron 1501 originally came with 256 MiB or RAM” was silly, even stupid, but there have been good arguments made by many editors here as to why they are appropriate in this article and so far I have seen nothing of substance to rebut the arguments, only the usual dismissive and insulting remarks by the IEC Binary Thought Police. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 20:07, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
:Oh dear! And we ''tried'' to be logical. So, the argument against their use that goes as follows:

::{{xt|When you consider that the kernel underling Linux, which is at the bottom of Ubuntu, was written when everyone used only the decimal prefixes (before the IEC proposal), and when you consider that all the flavors of Linux ''combined'' enjoy ~2% of the O.S. share, which is less representation than iOS, and when you consider that there are ''dozens'' of flavors of Linux out there, only one of which is Ubuntu, and when you consider that command-line partitioning tools show the decimal prefixes for storage capacity and only <u>some</u> GUI-tools on Ubuntu (notably or a particular disk partitioning tool) use the IEC prefixes, the use of the IEC prefixes to describe the storage space available on hard drives is such a small subset of the universe of hard drive capacity-reporting, the chart here in this article would have to be three feet wide denoting practices down to the hundredth of a percentile point to capture nuances this fine. So it amounts to grasping at diaphanous straws in a disingenuous attempt to justify using and helping to promote the IEC prefixes—in an article on ''hard drives'' of all things.}}

* The above-proposed graph needs lots of work and there is no point trying to resolve atomic-level details to everyone’s satisfaction right here, right now. Those sort of details take time and discussion to improve things incrementally. The proper resolution is that the [[Hard_disk_drive#Capacity_measurements|table in the article]] merely have the “Binary Prefixes” column deleted. There will be no mention of “binary prefixes” since well over 99% of users see no such thing.<p>FYI, I changed “decimal prefixes” and “binary prefixes” in the above table to “decimal math” and “binary math” since the distinction isn’t the ''prefixes''—which stay the same for 99.9 percent of users—but is a distinction of the <u>math</u> underlying the <u>meaning</u> of the conventional prefixes. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 20:51, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
:: "Decimal math" and "binary math" sounds a bit silly and is somewhat of an original definition. According to the [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html NITS] the correct terminology would be "multiples" as in "prefixes for binary multiples". —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 22:42, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
:::You missed my point: it’s not about the ''prefixes''. Except for a subset of drive partitioning software utilities in a subset of Linux, the industry uses ''one'' set of prefixes two different ways. The table as now drafted shows the two meanings of “GB.” One could call it “Decimal multiples” and “Binary multiples” too. If you’re certain you’re technically correct, be my guest and revise the table; no objections here, Ruud. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 23:32, 13 April 2011 (UTC)

Regarding the conclusion to this, here's a modification of a suggested paragraph:
{{quotation|A one terabyte hard disk drive stores 1,000 gigabytes, however operating systems report the size of such a hard disk drive to be smaller, e.g. 931.3 gigabytes. The discrepancy occurs because a gigabyte has a ''binary'' definition of 1,024 x 1,024 x 1,024 bytes (instead of the 1,000 x 1,000 x 1,000 ''decimal'' definition used by hard disk manufacturers). As the term "gigabyte" therefore has two practical uses, a system of [[Binary_prefix|binary prefixes]] has been proposed to account for the discrepancy, however the prefixes have not been adopted by the manufacturers of hard disk drives, nor are they used by the majority of operating system manufacturers.}}

: I think this contains sloppily worded:
:* "... a gigabyte has a ''binary'' definition of ...", implies there is one definition of gigabyte while two problem is that there are two definitions in use.
:* "... a system of [[Binary_prefix|binary prefixes]] has been proposed to account for the discrepancy ..." The prefixes do not account for the discrepancy, the two definitions of gigabyte do, the new prefixes where intended to end the discrepancy by making it unambiguous to which of the two definitions is referred.

== Momentary unlock or simply "unlock" ==

There seems to be a general consensus on what needs to be done. A brief mentioning of the [[binary prefix]]es (spelled out by name of the subject) and its failure to gain traction is fine. And further, there would be no use of the IEC prefixes themselves in a table (if a table is truly needed) or in text to describe the magnitude of memory, disk capacity, or file size. With that in mind, we have two options moving forward:
# '''Temporary unlock''' Agree on the details of verbiage here on this talk page and ask HJ Mitchell to allow a shepherding editor of that revised section to post it and then lock the thing down, or…
# '''Indefinite unlock''' Ask HJ Mitchell to indefinitely unlock the article. Then a team of editors acting in good faith can go rework the disputed section.
<hr/><br>
* '''#2, Indefinite unlock''' - I move that we get back to normalcy ASAP. Good-faith editing in line with the general consensus is welcome.

* Ruud’s effort is an excellent start and, if not ideal, is certainly in keeping with the general consensus on this talk page.

Their [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=423360411#Capacity previous use in this article] placed undo emphasis on the units and implied ubiquity in the discipline wildly in excess of reality; ''very'' few of our readers have ever seen them and ''will'' ever see them in the real world.

That was the same complaint the community saw after the MOSNUM guidelines covering this subject were adopted a couple of years ago. Yet there was indeed a consensus. Those here who are now dissatisfied with the outcome of this discussion and debate ''actually undermined'' their own objectives when a lead proponent of using the IEC prefixes [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive686#Extreme_canvasing_by_RaptorHunter|directly contacted over 100 individual editors]].

So to use them in a table in this article in the measure of binary capacity would violate [[WP:WEIGHT]] and [[WP:RS]] by placing undo emphasis on the units and would suggest ubiquity at odds with reality. Well beyond 99.5% of the OS industry does not use the IEC prefixes. ''All'' computer magazines directed to a general-interest readership do not use them. NO manufacturer of hard drives—what this article is all about—use the IEC prefixes on their packaging or promotional materials when communicating to their customer base. Even manufacturers of RAM (which isn’t even the subject of this article but would be the most logical industry to adopt the IEC prefixes) don’t use them when communicating to their general-interest customer base. Fate [http://www.flightsim.com/review/cfs3-1/spitfire_in_storm3.jpg did not smile] upon the IEC prefixes in the computing world.<p>Note that WP:RS requires that our articles be balanced and based upon {{xt|all majority and <u>significant</u> minority views}} (my emphasis). A small fraction of 1% does not so qualify. Moreover [[Wikipedia:Mosnum#Quantities_of_bytes_and_bits|WP:MOSNUM, here]] states that the IEC prefixes could be used {{xt|when the article is on a topic where the majority of cited sources use the IEC prefixes}}. Given that the vast majority of the RSs here in this article ''don’t'' use them, the arguments to use them utterly crumble because they have no logical foundation that is remotely compliant with the principles of Wikipedia and technical writing.

You need to explain how your point of is better than that consensus. In the whole if this talk page and other talk pages you have not done that. I think if you take this to the next level you have a good chance of being blocked for [[WP:TEND]]. [[User:Glider87|Glider87]] ([[User talk:Glider87|talk]]) 03:35, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

== First column of chart ==

Ruud, that first column of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=424035553#Capacity the chart,] which has two cells (“source” “units”), each describing the nature of headings in the entire row to the right, is more confusing than it is helpful. If omitted, the table is self-explanatory. I tried to fix it but am not handy with tables this complex. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 15:19, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

* Thanks {{diff||prev|424042305|for that}}, Woodstone. The table as it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=424054116#Capacity looks here,] reads quite nicely. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 16:51, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

== An Alternate Proposal For Table 2 ==

I don't think the table, with it's current entries, helps our readers as much as it could. Why not use real life examples of HDD capacities. Such as: 20, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, 500, 750 GB drives, and 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 TB drives (or some subset of them). The largest consumer drive is currently at the 3 TB point (with rumors of a 4 TB on the way). Prices of drives at and below 2 TB are at commodity price points now; $90 street for 2TB, $55 for 1TB, OEM. And there are still plenty of the smaller units around in use, especially in laptops and netbooks. If a reader sees the capacity of a drive he/she has in their system, wouldn't that provide more meaning than theoretical capacities? Thoughts? — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 02:32, 16 April 2011 (UTC)

* I think what you are suggesting would be a good ''supplement'' to the current table (not a replacement). The current table handily drives home the concept of the divergence between the hard drive world’s decimal use of terms like ''megabyte'' and ''gigabyte'' and shows how it is a 2.4% difference and then a nearly 5, 7, and 10% difference as one works their way up the multiples.<p>What is sorely missing is along the lines of what you are talking about. It ''could also include'' a column for the difference between the “advertised” capacity (again, in the decimal sense), and what you actually have left over after formatting.<p>You could have “advertised” (in the same decimal measures used by the vendor), the actual formatted capacity (decimal again), and the actual formatted capacity available for files measured using the binary definition. The beauty of your approach is you can take an actual hard drive you have laying around and see what these values are. If you have both Macs and PCs (or dual-boot Mac like mine with Bootcamp), you could make one killer of a table.<p>Coincidentally enough, I just had my brother drop off an off-site backup drive only 20 minutes ago and it’s getting a [[Time Machine (Mac OS)|Time Machine]] backup session right now. But I’m afraid to wipe the thing. Since a colossal digital disaster a bit over a year ago, I never, '''ever''' take risks. I have my important business data in the following locations:
:#The built-in hard drive in the iMac
:#A Firewire hard drive in a fire-resistant safe off the end of the desk (with 16 quart-size, all-metal paint cans of paraffin wax with a melting point of 57&nbsp;°C occupying the bulk of the free volume in the safe). The Time Machine allows me to retrieve versions of files I’m working on from an  hour previously, or five hours previously, or a version from a month ago or more. It’s therefore especially good for human error. It can be used to make a new, fully booting hard drive volume and would be missing, on average, only 30 minutes of data.
:#The aforementioned off-site USB backup drive (also backed up by Time Machine), with the session timing enforced by a computerized calendar reminder to make that phone call every three months so my brother drops it off after work. It is capable of completely restoring a new hard drive with everything to make a bootable volume with all OS resources and applications. But it would, on average, be missing 6 weeks of data.
:#[http://www.carbonite.com/lp/ppc/goog-mini-tm.aspx?match=s&adnumber=8146802821&mkwid=sxm3zeY0a&gclid=CILRn8SDoKgCFQkLbAodFkrkHQ Carbonite] offsite backup continuously running in the background. It would be current to within an hour or so on recovering all data and no fire or burglary could possibly deprive me of the data because the server is in an entirely different state on the other side of this continent. However, the recovered files don’t include important resources to make a boot disk and recover applications (just a matter of money and time).
:#Backup of my business data onto my iPhone using [http://www.mobileflashfiles.com/ Flash File] on the iPhone and [http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html ChronoSync] on the Mac. The timing of these sessions are also enforced with a computerized calendar reminder on ''both'' the computer and the iPhone. If I’m standing there looking at the glowing embers of my burned-down house as the firemen spray down hot spots, I can pat the pocket holding my iPhone (''and'' cross my fingers that the firesafe and paraffin wax kept my Time Machine drive from baking).

:So… no more *digitally bold* Greg L. Backups are good. Definitely. ''Then'' I watch Judge Wapner. Fate can have my data when it pries the hard drives from my cold dead fingers. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 02:57, 16 April 2011 (UTC)

== It was getting off-topic ==

The section on capacity had gotten too off-topic. I’ve trimmed it to precisely what would be in that section if there were no battles here to cloud the issue. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=424328613#Capacity Here] is the revised wording, which cuts to the chase of what the lawsuit was about and what the industry currently does with that dual meaning. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 06:59, 16 April 2011 (UTC)

== Compromise: the camel's nose ==

BTW, I don’t have any problem with RaptorHunter’s addition of a ''See also: [[Binary prefix]]'' to the top of the ''Capacity'' section [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=424469798#Capacity (perma-link).] I think that is perfectly in keeping with Wikipedia’s best practices and best serves the interests of our readership.

I can understand, given the [[WP:Tendentious editing|tendentiousness]] of some of the IEC-prefix advocates, that some here might fear that this edit is a harbinger of the Arab proverb that goes, ''“If you allow the camel’s nose under  your tent during the sandstorm, eventually the whole camel will be on your bed roll.”'' We’ll deal with the camel if and when it occurs. In the mean time, I see no problem with its nose. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 18:39, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

:Greg, if you remember, making the capacity section into a summary section without IEC units, and a section tophat link to the main article, was my compromise suggestion, oh so long ago.  At least it feels long ago what with all the kibibytes expended here. ;-) The combined threads on this page are now about 40K words long. It's interesting that despite all the contentiousness, the article is on less than 30 watchlists. Also, any problem with delisting the RfC from [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Maths, science, and technology|here]] now?
:BTW, I mostly agree with your comments about Micro$oft. Even though I have used DOS and Windows since about version 3 of PC-DOS, I switched to Linux about 2.5 years ago and couldn't be happier. And despite having been a MS beta tester for a while back in the day. I keep [[WinXP]] as a [[VirtualBox]] guest OS for the few apps I need that Linux doesn't have.  — [[User:Becksguy|Becksguy]] ([[User talk:Becksguy|talk]]) 04:18, 18 April 2011 (UTC)

::No problem here with the RfC notice(s). As widely advertised as that thing was, the rest of the community either looked upon it with a collective “*Meh*”, or quite possibly looked at the length of the discussions here, crapped their pants, yelled “F*ck '''''me!!!''''' and ran screaming, thinking this place to be a land of Turkish butt-stabbings and jihadists with suicide belts.

::As for your earlier suggestion, if that was more than… what… two weeks ago in earth-reality time, then that was the equivalent to ''four months'' in Wikipedia time, where space-time is dilated or something. I swear, some 16-year-old kid can get a year banishment at ANI and think “What?!? A '''year'''!! I could be married with three children by then!”

::Speaking of virtual OSs hosted on an OS, I’ve got Mac OS X 7.5.5 that can launch as a virtual machine within OS X via [http://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver SheepShaver].

:::::Your "Deliberate attempts to circumvent..." text is totally irrelevant because the two links you describe above as reverting vandalism were to undo edits where the edit summary was ''not'' marked as "minor", and was ''not'' in any way misleading (it was crystal clear: "restore Wtshymanski edit...", with the URL of the edit being restored). In the second link (the earlier revert), you reverted the <u>three</u> prior edits ({{diff|Floppy disk|prev|424233917|by Preslethe}} and {{diff|Floppy disk|prev|424404521|by 83.30.140.124}} and {{diff|Floppy disk|prev|424584482|by 81.105.209.229}}).

::::::The edit summary doesn't have to be marked as minor for that section to apply.

As [[WP:VAND]] also says "Some vandals even follow their vandalism with an edit that states 'rv vandalism' in the edit summary in order to give the appearance the vandalism was reverted" which is just what this IP user did, so it also falls under the "what is vandalism" section.

That I.P. hails from the Netherlands and may not have ever been a party to, or aware of, these discussions. If one assumes that to be the case, then the I.P. could not have deliberately attempted to circumvent a guideline. Since the edit wasn’t something like '''ROBERT POOED HIS SHORTS IN GYM CLAAAAS''', the edit can easily be seen as being well intentioned, thinking that the finest encyclopedia ought to use the finest, cool-beans lingo just passed down from the Vulcan High Command  (along with writing {{xt|99.8&nbsp;%}} with the space before the percent symbol because that comes from ''Starfleet'' of all places).

That editor probably knows that our readers will go “WTF?!?” upon encountering this [http://disgrasian.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/unicorn_rainbow1.jpg New and Modern Way Of Doing Things®™©,] but also likely sincerely believes our readership will actually remember this stuff and will, in turn, demand that the computer manufacturers use it on their product packaging and, perhaps too, they might write the editors of ''PC&nbsp;World'' demanding they adopt new-age words like “kibibits” so the computer industry can sound more “Klingon” so nerds can ''really'' make the jocks feel inferior as they’re serving up some [http://www.dailyhaha.com/_pics/power_wedgie.jpg atomic wedgies.]

As Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that ''anyone'' can edit, no technical writing experience is required; only a unfailing self-confidence that he or she can teach the planet something.

:I am going to assume that Glider87 will be more careful in the future. This is a minor issue, and it would have been desirable to back out of it gracefully rather than insist that reverting three different editors (including [[User:Preslethe|Preslethe]], see above) as "vandalism" was ok. Sure, the IP was clearly offtrack, and their edit summary was inappropriate, but experienced editors are supposed to take that in their stride (just use "not needed" as the edit summary if nothing else comes to mind). In general, it is never helpful to describe edits as vandalism, except at an appropriate noticeboard (such terminology excites real vandals and distresses non-vandals, so it is never helpful).

== Consolidation of HDD market ==

There is a rumor, reported in the [[WSJ]], that Samsung may sell their HDD unit to Seagate [http://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-seagate-harddrive-hdd-ssd,12606.html]. Hitachi GST and Western Digital (WD) announced in March that WD would acquire the HDD business from Hitachi, subject to regulatory approval, etc.[http://www.hitachigst.com/press-room/2011/western-digital-to-acquire-hitachi-global-storage-technologies].  If both spin offs go through, that will pretty much leave the consumer 3.5 inch HDD market to WD & Seagate. 
*Connor → Seagate (1996)
*Quantum → Maxtor (2000)
*IBM → Hitachi GST (2003)
*Maxtor → Seagate (2005)
*Fujitsu → Toshiba (2009) - Toshiba doesn't manufacture 3.5 drives.
*Samsung → Seagate (rumored, maybe 2011)
*Hitachi GST → WD (probable 2011)
Didn't research the 2.5 HDD market, the enterprise HDD market, or the [[SSD]] drop-in market. Also, Samsung announced a 4TB drive at CeBIT, and claims they will ship some time in 2011.[http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/storage/display/20110308081634_Samsung_Shows_Off_Prototype_of_4TB_Hard_Disk_Drive.html].

**My comments to both Tom and Greg are below.  As to Tom's most recent input, while we have a going-in AGF, that is a rebuttable presumption.  By violating a guideline repeatedly, an editor can lose that assumption.  [[wp:consensus]] makes clear that tendentious editing against consensus is in fact ''not'' welcome; I wouldn't want Tom to get too heady with Raptor's advice, and find himself subject to sanctions.  Of course, Tom's input which is ''not'' guideline-violative is very much appreciated and welcomed.  Which I imagine is part of Raptor's advice.--[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 15:56, 15 April 2011 (UTC)
*Two comments.  One, I'm perhaps just a bit confused as to how Tom might have derived from the above discussion anything other than a consensus rejection of what he re-proposes, as though no discussion has been had.  Perhaps I am missing something.  But without further clarification, his suggestion does perhaps seem to fall afoul of wp:consensus, which if I recall correctly does have language about tendentious editing in the face of consensus that might in the eyes of some have a measure of applicability to Tom's proposal.  Second comment -- @Greg -- while I understand your upset, perhaps there is a gentler way with which to communicate with Tom, that might serve to "reach" him.  Though I'm sure I don't know what it is.--[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 05:11, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

So using the terminology in this article in this manner was transparently a simple matter of trying to promote a nice idea that didn’t catch on by using them in a table in an “Oh… Didn’cha know??”-fashion. Wikipedia is never allowed to be exploited in that manner, which was a [http://members.iinet.net.au/~jez/junk/well-duh.jpg clear violation] of [[Wikipedia:Not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_or_means_of_promotion|WP:SOAP]] and its #1 prohibition against '''advocacy'''. The proponents’ ''own arguments'' on this talk page betrayed that motivation; that the IEC prefixes are superior and the industry ''ought'' to adopt them. Notwithstanding that deep desire, the simple fact is that the computing industry near-universally does not use the IEC prefixes and merely defines the common prefixes two different ways; ergo, almost none of our readership has a clue what “kibibit” and “KiB” means when they encounter it and it is a near certainty they would never see it again after they left this Wikipedia page.<p>So it’s over, now.

{{outdent}}Been busy since yesterday and missed most of the above, none of which seems to add much.  Let me explain why I think the additional row both is fully compliant with MOSNUM and adds to the article:
*The so-called consensus paragraph now explicitly discusses IEC Binary Prefixes and therefore the article is eligible for the MOSNUM exception.  Note that I did not propose the paragraph, but I do accept it.  I believe it has also been accepted by all the IEC Binary Prefix Thought Police.
*The pedagogical question is then whether the article is better by discussing the existence of IEC Binary Prefixes '''AND''' using them or as it is currently proposed, discussing their existence but not using them.  IMO, the former is preferred since it both describes their existence and shows a context.  The current construction leaves the reader ignorant and possibly confused.  I think any teacher amongst our editors would state that the preferred teaching method is to both discuss and use.
All should recall that this fire storm started with a discussion of whether the article was or was not compliant with MOSNUM; the consensus seems to have brought the article into literal compliance and now the question is do we use the prefixes or not.  I would really like to hear from someone other than Greg L, Fnag, Glider and the unidentified IP why my reasoning is flawed. I'm going to be off line for another 24 or so hours.

::*Thanks for responding.  Turned out I was more than 24 hours off this dialog.  I fail to understand any requirement that "a significant quantity of ... OS manufacturers" use IEC Binary Prefixes in order to discuss them in an encyclopedic article (FWIW, I doubt if the HDD manufacturers will ever use IEC Binary Prefixes - no reason for them to do so).  It seems to me that a use by reliable sources such as the Ubantu and GNU utilities to describe HDD capacity should be sufficient to discuss them in the capacity section of the HDD article. I can't think of another MOSUM item being censored in this manner, particularly one endorsed by an extraordinarily [[reliable source]], the IEC (this is not furlongs/fortnight).  I also note you didn't respond to my teaching argument about usage in the context of the so-called consensus paragraph - if we were to mention them why not use them?  Unfortunately, paragraph was subsequently completely rewritten to obviate my argument (by guess who).  I am sorry you find my characterization of "IEC Binary Thought Police" as rude; it is an accurate shorthand for the gang of three (maybe four) and far less rude than the several things said by them about me personally and my arguments in favor of using IEC Binary Prefixes in this article.

:*The article discusses the difference between GB/TB in the decimal sense and binary sense. It does not explicitly discuss IEC prefixes, it only mentions an attempt by the IEC to create a standard. The article does not '''need''' to use IEC prefixes to discuss this difference because it already talks about the relative sizes of the bytes involved. The job of discussion of the IEC prefixes is specifically the domain of the other linked article, not this article. The article itself mentions that the IEC prefixes have seen little adoption. Therefore to disambiguate a number of bytes with prefixes that themselves are not often used and are not familiar to the readers and therefore need further explanation in this article does not improve the article. Since there exist other more familiar disambiguation methods (number and power notation are more familiar) that do not use IEC prefixes and do not need so much explanation, then that method of disambiguation is better. Not to mention using IEC prefixes causes problems with [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:UNDUE]] because the majority of reliable sources for the article don't use IEC prefixes. Since the reliable sources do not generally use the IEC prefixes then you do not have a case to use them here. The other article shows conext, it is not the job of this article to show "''context''" just because in your opinion you think they are better. Wikipedia doesn't accept [[WP:ILIKEIT]] as a valid reason to add something to an article. Wikipedia reports how the real world is by using reliable sources and then reporting significant points of view. '''[[User:Fnagaton|Fnag]][[User talk:Fnagaton|aton]]''' 06:04, 16 April 2011 (UTC)

* Indeed. Tom94022’s logic is self-serving rhetoric that would vanish into thin air if he turned off the reality distortion field surrounding it. Sure, the article mentions that the IEC proposed their prefixes and the computing world virtually totally ignores the proposal. I just got through rewriting that section and likely ''expanded'' the discussion of it as I made that passage more useful to our readership. And for my trouble, I get a face full of ''silly-reasoning'' pie. The article ''mentions'' their being essentially <u>unused</u> in the real world and from ''that'' he makes the logical leap that we now magically ''need to <u>use</u> them'' in the table. It’s a leap of logic I can’t fathom. Setting aside the wikilawyering for a moment and exposing the 800-pound underlying-motive gorilla in the room, Tom94022 must craft logical nonsense like that because he is afraid to openly admit the real reason: He '''[[WP:SOAP|advocates]]''' their adoption by the computing world as he yells “'''Pay no attention to that [[WP:UNDO|undo weight]] [http://verdoux.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/pay-no-attention-to-the-man-behind-the-curtain.jpg?w=497&h=372 behind the curtain!]'''<p>If Tom94022 is going to continue to agitate based upon the fact that the article now discusses them, I am perfectly content <u>just leaving out those two paragraphs</u>. Those two paragraphs amount to a big pile of discussing something that ''*could have been*'' and aren’t in the least bit necessary when discussing the class-action lawsuit, which was entirely over how the industry had two different ways of defining “megabyte” and came up with the lower-capacity definition for self-serving reasons because it was smaller. Nothing about the lawsuit was centered about the industry’s use or non-use of the IEC prefixes. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 06:46, 16 April 2011 (UTC)<p><!--

:::Because in Wikipedia articles do not report minority points of view to the same extent as those in the majority and this article doesn't '''need''' to use IEC to make a [[WP:NPOV|point]]. Like in the article about [[Earth]] it barely mentions the flat Earth theory, it certainly '''does not''' go on to deeply discuss the issue. Why? Because that article is about the Earth and as such it does not report or discuss minority points of view. Using IEC prefixes faces the same problems of [[WP:UNDUE]] and trying to expand the section of a flat Earth in the Earth article. To include IEC prefixes in the table when they are hardly used presents a misleading report on how the world is.

*I completely agree with Fnagaton here. Woodstone is comparing apples and oranges. The point of a table of the composition of the earth’s crust is to find out what-all is in it. Constituents like iridium, which is rare on earth but was enriched by an asteroid in a layer at the end of the Cretaceous period, is of great interest to readers. The ''point'' of such charts are to show great detail; the best ones show constituents at finer levels. What people are ''not'' interested in is learning new terminology to use as part of their vernacular if it is used by only by the computer-equivalent of [http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/269/cache/unbound-bhutan_26944_600x450.jpg Mongolian yak herders] and isn’t to be found on the store shelves at the computer store nor in the magazines they buy.<p>If we wanted to really run with Woodstone’s logic, we should burden our tables with obscure lingo used by one ten-thousandth of the computing world [http://www.buckswoodside.com/archives/images/koko2.jpg (Koko the gorilla?)] because radiation tables go down to one-millionth of a REM.<p>The place for our readers to be exposed to topics ''about'' the units of measure that the computer industry uses (and for the most part, ''doesn’t'' use) to measure the digital capacity of computers is in articles on those subjects, such as ''[[Megabyte]]''; not by adding unneeded and flat-out unnecessary obscure terminology that hardly anyone uses right into body text and tables showing capacities.

As such even if [[WP:NPOV]] did not specifically talk about facts my argument would stand because obviously the viewpoint of the IEC is not being followed by the majority of the computing industry. As such that viewpoint would still fall under [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:UNDUE]]. '''[[User:Fnagaton|Fnag]][[User talk:Fnagaton|aton]]''' 10:22, 17 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::* Quoting Woodstone: {{xt|The proposed addition does not claim that IEC prefixes are common; that would be a viewpoint. Instead it says that a particular operating system uses IEC prefixes}}. Indeed, using them in the table wouldn’t be *claiming* that the use of the IEC prefixes are common in the industry; the practice would be ''using'' them in a fashion '''''as if''''' they are far more common than they really are. Since 99.8% of the industry doesn’t use them, nor does one single computer magazine directed to a general-interest readership, nor is such terminology found in the ''Microsoft® Computer Dictionary'', the vast majority of the RSs on this topic don’t use the IEC prefixes. Wikipedia must follow the RSs. MOSNUM’s advise sets the bar appropriately high and states that if a ''majority'' of the RSs on the subject of hard drives use the IEC prefixes, then we may do so in this article. That obviously isn’t the case. You know that, Woodstone.<p>Your desire to flout bedrock-like principles of Wikipedia pertaining to “always follow the RSs” amounts to  [[WP:SOAP|SOAP-like '''advocacy''']] of a cool-beans practice you think the world should know more about. We never allow Wikipedia to be hijacked so. The community was asleep at the switch when a ''very'' small cabal of editors—one or two of whom very likely literally still lived in their mothers’ basements as they had a ''lot'' of time on their hands—and a rogue admin pulled this very same stunt of advocacy five years ago and ''literally'' changed scores—if not hundreds—of articles in one single evening to create thousands of instances of {{xt|The Dell Inspiron 1501 originally came with 256 [[MiB]] or RAM}}. That idiotic practice that violated several tenets of ''Technical Writing 101'' persisted for three long years. Please recall that '''Wikipedia’s Wise and Unfailing Leadership By Example®™©''' for three years did not inspire the rest of the world to follow our practice. So, give it up please; unless it is on an article such as ''[[Megabyte]]'' or ''[[Binary prefix]]'', the IEC prefixes are dead and buried for general use on Wikipedia’s computer-related articles to describe binary capacity in an “Oh… Didn’cha know?!?”-fashion. It’s time to play taps, wipe a tear, and move on.<p>Now, [[WP:MOSNUM#Quantities of bytes and bits]] is perfectly clear and perfectly applicable in this case. Your reasoning, Woodstone, and that of Tom94022 and RaptorHunter crumbles under even cursory inspection because the underlying motive is '''advocacy'''. You are therefore wasting ''dozens'' of man-hours on both sides of the fence here as you beat around the bush with wiki-slogans in a vain attempt explain away inconvenient truths. There is nothing in you guys’ arguments that is in the ''least bit'' compelling to flout the applicable guidelines on MOSNUM, which are themselves founded upon fundamental, bedrock principals of [[WP:RS]] and [[WP:WEIGHT]].<p>Please don’t confuse a lack of further response by me to your posts as acquiescence and agreement with your logic and motives. A lack of response would be best explained as my seeing nothing new and persuasive out of you. If that proves to be the case, I might be feeling your persistence to be redundant and potentially [[WP:tendentious editing|tendentious]]. One tactic I can guarantee won’t work for you is getting your way by refusing to let up in the face of a finding of a general consensus here by a couple of admins.

Mr. Woodstone, would you care to join the rest of the class and learn? (That was my best imitation of a 2nd-grade teacher). Some admins have opined that we have a general consensus here that isn’t to your liking. That comes under the heading of “so sad – too bad.”

Now, if you care to read up on [[Wikipedia:Consensus]], an RfC isn’t just head-count. Any notion of relying upon head count was thrown out of a 4th-floor window after an editor who shall remain nameless directly contacted over 100 individuals in a humongous, marathon canvassing session. And, for whatever it’s worth, if we omitted the responses from those editors who had been directly contacted, you’d lose on a pure head-count basis (as if that mattered anyway).

Beyond head-count, a ''big'' factor in considering a consensus is the weight and validity of the arguments and their adherence to Wikipedia’s principals. Those are ''even more'' important than head-count; WP:Consensus states {{xt|Consensus is ultimately determined by the quality of the arguments given for and against an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy, not by a simple counted majority.}} Did you notice that? “Not by a simple counted majority.”

Furthermore, the guideline on WP:MOSNUM governing this issue is clear and unambiguous and was the product of a ''very'' lengthy process that was extensively and meticulously conducted and which enjoyed substantial participation on a wide variety of pages and subpages. As WP:CONSENSUS states: {{xt|Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale.}} 

It simply comes down to the fact that those who came down on the side of not using the virtually unknown IEC prefixes to denote binary capacity consistently cited [[WP:WEIGHT|WP:UNDO WEIGHT]] and [[WP:RS]] as bedrock principals that were being violated. That consensus view had the added virtue of being solidly “through the lens of Wikipedia policy.” That stacks the deck against the other side, whose arguments ranged from “The IEC prefixes are unambiguous and should not be ignored by the world” to “I like them… ''smell'' my finger!” [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 19:45, 18 April 2011 (UTC)

:Woodstone even if 100 people came along and voted [[WP:ILIKEIT]] against one person who makes a strong argument using Wikipedia policy it would still '''not be''' consensus for those 100 people. This is because consensus is determined by strong argument and not a simple majority. You know this, or at least you should know this by now given how long you've been editing and since others have directly told you this. So I don't see how you can continue to misrepresent what Wikipedia policy says. '''[[User:Fnagaton|Fnag]][[User talk:Fnagaton|aton]]''' 00:06, 19 April 2011 (UTC)

===Arbitrary break: Why not?===
I didn't read the whole discussion, but I can't see what the big deal is with mentioning and exemplifying IEC prefixes, ''provided'' that we also clearly state that their adoption by the media and industry has been negligible. I can see the point about undue weight, but we're talking about one sentence and one table column in an 84-kilobyte-long article. (By comparison, 99.9% of the times the unit of volume equal to 0.568 litres is called just “pint” rather than “imperial pint”, but if we were talking about when you promised me ten pints of beer, I expected to get 5.68 litres but you only gave me 4.73 litres, I would see no reason in banning the i-word altogether.) On the other hand, the section as it is right now looks clear enough to me even only using common prefixes, so I can see no big deal in leaving the IEC prefixes out, either. ― [[User:A. di M.|A. di&nbsp;M.]]​<sub lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">[[User talk:A. di M.|plé]]</sub>​<sup lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">[[Special:Contributions/A. di M.|dréachtaí]]</sup> 11:12, 19 April 2011 (UTC)

:Your analogy to “quarts” is interesting but doesn’t hit the spot. A list detailing all the world’s “quarts” is similar to a chart detailing the crustal composition of the earth: one detailing the rarer elements and minerals is better; the list detailing the most very rare constituents is best. In stark contrast to that, the issue at hand here is one of the very ''<u>vernacular</u>'' used in the industry. When the vernacular and the units of measure customarily used within a particular discipline is the topic at hand, Wikipedia uses a specific standard: one of following the practcies of the majority of the most reliable RSs. That principle is delineated in great detail at WP:MOSNUM.

:The ''whole'' point of with all of MOSNUM’s advise is to uphold the principal of what any good encyclopedia does: to educate our readership and properly prepare them for their continuing studies elsewhere. One does not accomplish that by using weird terminology in hopes that readers will waltz into a computer store and ask for a SIMM card with “two gibibytes of RAM”. That advocacy and hoped-for grass-roots adoption was a stated goal of the advocates here on this page. We don’t do that.<p>The lawsuit and confusion was over the industry’s dual definitions of “megabyte” because the IEC prefixes are so very soundly ignored by the computing world. The IEC prefixes are used not by “Linux users”, nor by “Ubuntu uses”; they are used by ''some'' partitioning tools (a particular GUI-based one as opposed to the built-in command-line one) available for some users of Ubuntu, which is one of a dozen or so flavors of Linux, which in total has less representation than Apple’s mobile iOS (~2&nbsp;%). They are a curio and relic of what might have been.<p>The best way to educate our readership and allow them to learn and do research is to do as we are now doing in the article: Have a table that doesn’t attach [[WP:WEIGHT|UNDO WEIGHT]] to a most-ignored bit of the very vernacular used by the industry, and to provide three links ([[megabyte|MB]], [[gigabyte|GB]], and [[terabyte|TB]]) and to provide a ''See also'' tophat link.<p>Think of it this way, A. di M.: imagine that a small (<0.2&nbsp;%) group of SI purists in the astronomy world wanted to use metres as ''the only'' measurement of length in astronomy. Are we to now add a table to [[Hubble constant]] so that ''the very vernacular'' supposedly used by the astronomy world includes a measure they don’t really use {{xt|(kilometers per second) per attometre}}?<p>Wikipedia will always have science cadets bent on violating WP:SOAP and its admonition against using Wikipedia for the purposes of '''[[wp:soap|advocacy]]'''. Notwithstanding that the <u>vast, vast majority</u> of RSs in astronomy do not use the SI unit {{xt|s<sup>–1</sup>}} (reciprocal second) to describe the magnitude of the [[Hubble constant]], which is a measure of how velocity changes with distance, and notwithstanding that doing so is contrary to [[Wikipedia:Mosnum#Which units to use]], which is perfectly clear on the matter (and for good reason), our ''[[Hubble constant]]'' article—[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hubble%27s_law&oldid=424901544 as of this version]—provides the way-cool, highly-SI-compliant value '''''along with the measure actually used in the industry''''': {{xt|1={{nowrap|''H''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 70.4 ± 2.4 (km/s)/Mpc}} {{nowrap|(or 2.39×10<sup>−18</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> ± 3.3%)}}.}} Note that the citation to which they link (''The Astrophysical Journal)'' didn’t provide the conversion; ‘twas an invention of a wikipedian somewhere (likely a college student giddy with how wise and knowledgable he or she had become in only four short months) trying to promote the adoption of all-things-too-cool and change the world. Indeed, to a certain extent, they did. Because now there are numerous Web sites that also mention this ridiculous unit of measure [http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/universe/questions_and_ideas/hubbles_law the BBC, here,] which merely copies the text from our article.<p>We need to be ever-vigilant to prevent Wikipedia from being hijacked for such advocacy; in the case of the IEC prefixes being used on Wikipedia, that practice went on for three whole years for one and '''''only''''' one reason: because the proponents were so animated and so tendentious and because the majority of the rest of the community just doesn’t have the time and patience to fight those who do the Wikipedia-equivalent of showing up at security check points wearing suicide vests.

:Please note: that last metaphor about suicide vests isn’t too far off; two editors responsible for spreading the IEC prefixes essentially overnight across Wikipedia’s computer articles fell on their Wikipedia swords after they lost on MOSNUM. One of those two editors who quit was an admin (who had used his powers to revert revertings of what they were doing).

:By the way, when I wrote “<0.2&nbsp;%”, above, I placed a space before the percent symbol. That too is in conformance with the clear requirements of the SI. However, I see that whoever chose to write {{nowrap|{{xt|1=2.39×10<sup>−18</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> ± 3.3%}}}} (as if “two quintillionths of a reciprocal second” clarifies anything for a single human being on this pale blue dot) was choosy with what parts of the SI (and MOSNUM) they were going to religiously conform to because he or she used the so-''very'' scientific and SI-compliant (but utterly unheard of) reciprocal second as a conversion and then eschewed the BIPM’s mandate that a space ''always'' goes between the numeric value and a unit symbol.

<br>
* '''P.S.''' Regarding that asinine reduction of {{xt|(kilometers per second) per attometre}} into {{xt|s<sup>−1</sup>}} (on the false premiss that “two quintillionths of a reciprocal second” clarifies anything in the slightest for anyone), the same thing is done with viscosity. I happen to have a Brookfield viscometer ([http://www.rheologyschool.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/viscometer5.jpg like this)] about ten feet behind me as I type this so I quite familiar with the subject. The whole underlying principle of viscosity is resistance to shear forces and the formula for calculating viscosity—when it is actually ''understandable''—is as follows:

:<big>µ = ''K''&middot;''f'' /&thinsp;(m/s)&thinsp;/&thinsp;m<sup>2</sup>&middot;m</big>

:…where µ is viscosity<br>
:''K'' is a factor for a particular fluid<br>
:''f'' is force in newtons<br>
:(m/s) is velocity<br>
:m<sup>2</sup> is the area of the surface being used in the shear-force measurement, and<br>
:''m'' is the distance separating the the measuring surface and the stationary one.

:Thus, this formula is illustrative of the actual physics underlying how viscosity works; a measuring area in close proximity to a fixed surface and the force required to slide the area at a given velocity.

:So guess what Ph.D instructors at colleges and engineers trying to impress do in order to demonstrate why they have claim to special knowledge regarding viscosity. Why, the reduce all those “meter” terms relating to area, distance, and velocity so the formula becomes abstracted beyond all comprehension. They end up with this:

:<big>µ = ''K''&middot;''p''&thinsp;&middot;s</big>

:…where ''p'' is <u>''pressure''</u> in pascals. They had taken every imaginable term and reduced and canceled until they ended up with force divided by area (pressure) even though “pressure” doesn’t have jack to do with the measurement of viscosity.

:As we all know, there is ''far'' too much of that going on here on Wikipedia as budding technical writers do drive-by shootings trying to show how they have mastery of mathematics and can reduce crap to unholy abstraction until what ought to be clear to our readers is as clear as mud. Too many wikipedians write to impress, not to educate. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 17:44, 20 April 2011 (UTC)

{{Outdent}}
My objections to the current revised [[Hard_disk_drive#Capacity_measurements|Capacity measurements]] section are:
#The added sentence "However, in computer memory (random-access memory, or RAM), and some other computing contexts, binary math is used, which only approximates decimal math but where the decimal prefixes such as kilo and mega were given nonetheless in the early days of computing science." is irrelevant to the subject of this section, is TMI and only represents one POV regarding the evolution of computer capacity measurements.
#The added list of binary values is redundant, adds irrelevant or non-existent values (kilo, tera, and "so forth") and is POV in that it overemphasizes binary values.
#The material on file system reporting is irrelevant and therefore TMI in this section.
#The unqualified "had financial consequences" is POV since it is not clear that the settlement costs were of any substantive financial cost to either HDD company.
Rather than just change the section as Greg L did, I have created a [[User:Tom94022/Sandbox1|proposed new section]] which I believe corrects the deficiencies of GregL's edits and improves the article over the so-called consensus paragraphs.  I would point out the following about this proposal which I believe to be superior to both the prior paragraphs:
*The first two paragraphs have reliable sources and are essentially a paraphrase of the WD article with the addition of the Fox news comment on familiarity.  They are symmetrical in treatment of decimal and binary systems.
*I chose to use the WD terms "decimal (base 10)"  and "binary (base 2)" through out rather than introduce other and potentially unfamiliar terms such as 2<sup>30</sup>=1024<sup>3</sup>.
*The third paragraph follows from the first two, explains why there is confusion, and comes from a reliable source.
*The three bulleted examples come from the consensus paragraph but are shorter.  There is no extraneous file system material.
*I moved the actual differences to referenced link to shorten the article and remove what to me is TMI.  I suppose I could make this an inline link.
*The lawsuit paragraph has the POV removed.
FWIW, I think the article would be even better if the third bullet mentioned IEC Binary Prefixes (as does the consensus paragraph) and the associated table used their symbols (as I have always held) and I wish we could have a serious discussion instead of the [[WP:SHOUT|shouting]], frivolous and [[Ad hominem|ad hominem]] arguments to date.  To the extent this proposal will bring on such nonsense (unfortunately I expect such) I invite you to comment on the talk page associated with my proposal where I have the right to excise such nonsense.

:Having skimmed through the discussion so far, I agree that the proposed version at the sandbox is an improvement over the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=425173812#Capacity_measurements current version] for the arguments you have just explained, because it provides a better exposition of the concepts at hand, and because it has more sources which then follows more closely. I have some caveats though: the usage of "base 2 measurements" in the Western Digital source is technically incorrect; the reported quantity 1,073,741,824 is ''not'' using [[base 2]] (which would use only the digits 0 and 1) but [[powers of 2]]. All references to (base 10) and (base 2) should IMO be replaced by (powers of 10) and (powers of 2) respectively.
::*Good point; I have no problems with this proposed change. 02:18, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

:I agree that the IEC Binary Prefixes paragraph, which had consensus to be included, would be a welcome addition as it's directly relevant to the topic of hard drive capacity, explaining that it was a (failed) attempt to resolve the confusion by a high-profile institution. I'd also like to see a [[wp:summary]] version of the [[Binary_prefix#Disk_drives]] section; the current treatment of ''Capacity measurements'' is painfully lacking any context as of the reasons why this confusion appeared in the first place, and that information is actually more relevant in [[Hard disk drive]] than in [[Binary prefix]]. 

:Finally, your proposed version should include the current table as it concisely explains the concepts at hand and has already been refined through consensus. 

:Disclaimer: I arrived to this talk page through the [[Talk:Hard_disk_drive#RFC_on_the_use_of_the_IEC_prefixes|RFC_on_the_use_of_the_IEC_prefixes]]. I largely agree that there's no need to use the prefixes to describe quantities and that MOSNUM is to be respected (I didn't participate to its creation, but I feel it's a good guideline), but also think that the IEC binary prefixes should be mentioned as a topic in this section. The ''See also'' wikilink to [[Binary prefix]] feels  otherwise unexplained IMHO, which creates undesired [[wp:astonishment]].

::::* The ''decimal capacity'' section uses the prefixes MB, GB and TB, which are not symmetrical to the ''binary capacity'' ones (KB, MB and GB); I think KB should be included because it better explains the sequence of powers of two. I would add KB also to ''decimal capacity'', but that's not included in the source.
::::* The last paragraph links in [[wp:summary style]] to the relevant sections in [[Binary prefix]]; this could be seen as a form of [[wp:overlink]] (although that guideline doesn't explicitly mention this case).

{{od}}Two guys walking into an empty country club, sitting down in the wing-back chairs, and going “Campy idea… indubitably” back & forth to each other isn’t what Wikipedia calls a “consensus.” [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 15:52, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

* I disagree with everything you wrote. The section has been the focus of intense scrutiny by the community because of your hissy fit. The section has been worked on by a ''handful of editors'' now. The better explanation for your sweeping objections is that you vociferously dissented <u>the entire time</u> the current MOSNUM guideline was debated two years ago, still don’t like it, tried to explain how MOSNUM didn’t apply here, you still '''BELIEVE'''®™© in the IEC prefixes and earnestly think they should be frequently used and discussed on Wikipedia in hopes that our doing so will somehow rescue them from near-absolute obscurity. The consensus view is not in alignment with your wishes, which are seen as being out of the mainstream and at odds with several of Wikipedia’s core principals. It’s also safe to assume that a number of other editors (you can guess who those are) feel the same way. Let’s see what they think…  [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 00:59, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

== Misleading assertions ==

User:Diego Moya had this bit added at the bottom of the ''Capacity'' section:

{{cquote|The confusion arising from these inconsistent definitions has been addressed by the industry either by [[Binary_prefix#Standardization_of_dual_definitions|standardization of the dual definitions]], attempts to define [[Binary_prefix#Unique_binary_prefixes|unique binary prefixes]] for the powers of two, or simply by choosing a primary convention for each different medium.}}

;POV-pushing
What he had looked [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=425271242#Capacity like this.] This was editorializing and POV-pushing and revisionism and just flat-out inaccurate. The confusion has ''not'' “been addressed” in part by the IEC prefixes. Except for an odd, GUI-based disk partitioning utility used by a particular flavor of Linux, <u>no</u> dominant player in the computing world (not O.S.s, not RAM, not computers, not hard drives) uses the IEC prefixes. So the IEC prefixes are no part of any solution that addresses anything for 99.8+ percent of users. And even for that 0.2% of users, everything they buy at the computer store and every computer magazine they buy that is directed to a general-interest readership doesn’t use such terminology. '''At all.''' So the confusion has certainly not “been addressed” in part by the IEC prefixes. So to lump them in with the reality of the situation (the computing world uses the conventional prefixes two different ways) was <u>totally misleading</u>.

;Overly aliased links, both advertising the same article on the binary prefixes
Moreover, the links in Moya’s above-quoted paragraph had been aliased to the point they provided the reader no flying clue as to the nature of the article to which they were being taken. Aliasing the living daylights out of our links is an old practice that is being deprecated. Editors are to take extra effort to use no aliasing or to use aliasing that does not totally obscure the nature of the article; readers shouldn’t be confronted with mysterious Easter Eggs and have to hover their cursor over links to find out where they’d be taken or (for most users) click on them to find out. The first one was this:<p> <code><nowiki>[[Binary_prefix#Standardization_of_dual_definitions|standardization of the dual definitions]]</nowiki></code><p>

And the second was this:<p><code><nowiki>[[Binary_prefix#Unique_binary_prefixes|unique binary prefixes]]</nowiki></code>.<p>

Thus, there were ''two'', highly aliased links in one single sentence advertising the wholesome goodliness of the IEC prefixes and their history. That too amounted to transparent, industrial-strength POV-pushing.

;Resolution
I’ve now revised that paragraph so it describes the current state of affairs just like a modern, most-reliable RS address the present state of affairs, which is without POV-pushing that was clearly in violation of [[WP:WEIGHT|WP:UNDO WEIGHT]] and [[WP:SOAP|WP:SOAP, NO ADVOCACY]].<p>

The closing paragraph now reads (as of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=425358438#Capacity this revision)] as follows:

{{cquote|In 1999, a trade organization attempted to address these dual definitions of the conventional prefixes by proposing unique ''[[binary prefix]]es'' and prefix symbols to use for denoting powers of 1024. Yet {{Years ago|1999}} years later, the proposal has seen no adoption by the dominant players in the computer industry and the prefixed forms of “byte” continue to have slightly different meanings depending on context.}}

Short, sweet, pure, and simple. And now that there is an explicit mentioning—linked, no less—of the [[binary prefix]]es, there is no need for the redundant linked ''See also'' tophat directing readers to the ''Binary prefixes'' article.<p>

;Appeal
To the IEC prefix-advocates: Although reality sucks, reality is what it is. You’ve got your mentioning of the utterly failed and ignored binary prefixes. If we’re gonna mention them, <u>then it will be clear that the dominant players in the computing world have totally ignored them</u> so their relevancy is properly and honestly and accurately conveyed (they were something that could have been but never were). I suggest you not try to push this point any further. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 14:45, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

<br><br><p>'''P.S.''' I added the short bit explaining the progression of the binary math. ''We'', as editors, understand this stuff fine. But binary math is not used in daily life by most people and readers shouldn’t have to go read another article to glean the important basics. It would be unclear to many readers how one obtains these powers of 1024 with each prefix. The short section describes how each ten powers of 2 equals powers of 1024 that themselves can be in powers. That section also makes it exceedingly clear how the 2.4% compounded departure with each prefix comes about. User:Tom94022’s objection that explaining this math equates to POV-pushing is utterly absurd and simply without foundation.

== Binary Math 101 ==

Yes, Diego. Regarding [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&action=historysubmit&diff=425345137&oldid=425342382 your edit,] and accompanying edit summary (''8 bits is not the same concept as 2^8, 10 bits is not the same as 2^10)''…<p>…please dig out your calculator. 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 and  2<sup>10</sup> = 1024. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 15:48, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:"Eight bits" means "eigth binary digits". "eight bits" doesn't mean "the eight power of two" even though it can carry that much amount of information when used together to represent a single number, which is what my edit summary means. See my expanded rationale below please. [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 16:03, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
::*''(*sigh*)'' Try reading before writing. Here’s a link: [[Bit]]. The distinction you seem to be drawing is that 10 bits does not ''*<u>necessarily</u>*'' mean that they are logically grouped together into a [[Word (computing)|word]] and therefore not logically even ''capable'' of having 2<sup>10</sup> possible combinations to them. Quibbling. '''''Any''''' plurality of 10 bits is mathematically capable of forming 1024 combinations; all you have to do is ''point'' to them or ''speak'' of the plurality. So I find your distinction to be razor-thin equivocating far beyond necessity. Nevertheless, I revised the text to belabor about how ''if one logically groups 8 or 10 bits into a word''. Doing so wasn’t in the least bit necessary to drive home the simple concept of 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 and introduces insider-speak (“word”) that normally means something entirely else to a general-interest readership.

== Addressing the latest concerns in ''Capacity measurements'' ==

I'm glad to see that this section is reaching a shape that solves the major contentious arguments in the above discussion. I have some remaining details that still bother me though. I'd like other editors to discuss these points in order to improve the quality of the section.
* I'm worried about use of the term [[binary math]] to describe the values of the prefixes. At Wikipedia that term refers to a ''binary numeral system'', i.e. a [[base 2]] [[positional number system]] using only two digits, but then all capacity measurements are expressed in [[base 10]] through powers of two; "binary math" is not a synonym. I know computer scientists have no problem converting between the two, but the article should be accessible to other audiences so there's no excuse to introduce lousy technical language. I think 'binary capacity' as explained in terms of combinations of bits, without any mention of binary math, would reduce confusion and eliminate the current inaccuracies, but I'm open to other proposals.
* The last paragraph about unique prefixes [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=425347340 in its current form] contains [[wp:weasel words]]: "a trade organization" (''which'' one?) and "the dominant players in the computer industry" (''who'' are they?). Either the IEC should me mention by name, along with the various standardization bodies that did adopt the proposal; or the paragraph should be included to explain that this proposal was not unique but there existed other similar earlier or later proposals by other agents.
* I'd like to source the assertion that no version of unique binary prefixes have been adopted by the industry. Would [[User:Greg L]] or any other editor who participated in the discussions of [[WP:MOSNUM]] be kind to provide a reliable source for this? I hope this should be relatively easy for you as you surely must be familiar with the material brought to that discussion. I'm genuinely curious about the history behind the IEC prefixes and their lack of success (I agree with Donald Knuth calling them "funny-sounding" and being taken by surprise by their "official" adoption and later de-facto relinquishment; I think it's a colourful anecdote in the history of computers). [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 16:01, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

::“Trade organization” isn’t a “weasel word” and your linking to it in that “I made it blue so it must be true”-fashion doesn’t make the allegation correct. Wikipedia is directed to a general-interest readership. Hardly anyone has heard of the International Electrotechnical Commission or Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers so “trade organization” is more accessible. If readers want to find out such details, they can click on the link; that’s what those are for.<p>I don’t agree with the rest of what you wrote and that doesn’t surprise me given the poor technical-writing you did while simultaneously POV-pushing. Your confusion over basic issues like bits and powers of 2 means I’m in for too much time-consuming, time-wasting business than I am prepared for given that I have real-life duties that call. Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that ''anyone'' can edit, but not ''everything'' that is written here sticks; being factual, true, and balanced not only matters, but is a necessity.

::: I will not answer to [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks|ad-hominem]] arguments since motivations of editors are irrelevant at Wikipedia, only discussion about content and sources matters; I don't want your agreement anyway, only that my arguments be addressed by some willing editor in a rational way. 
::: As for the paragraph you added, you'll excuse me for disagreeing, but there's absolutely no indication in it that the provided link (by the words "binary prefix") will contain a subsection about the discussed proposal; the link can only be reasonably interpreted as linking to a definition of binary prefixes. Do you expect readers to be prescient and know that the information they want will be waiting for them at the other end of a link they haven't followed yet? Unless you do, the words "a trade organization" remains an unsupported attribution (a.k.a. weasel word). Is there a problem in changing the sentence to "the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers|IEEE]], [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] and [[ International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] trade organizations attempted to address these dual definitions..."?  
::: There's the alternate possibility of linking directly to [[Binary_prefix#Unique_binary_prefixes]] expanding the link to the words "by [[Binary_prefix#Unique_binary_prefixes|proposing unique binary prefixes]] and prefix symbols". This would provide enough [[information scent]] for the reader to find out more about the existence of this   proposal that was mentioned in the included paragraph; but you don't seem fond of this kind of wikilinks, so I'd opt for mentioning the name of the organization making the proposal and copying here some of the references available at the other article. The request for a reliable source in particular for "the proposal has seen no adoption by the dominant players in the computer industry" you should not ignore, as this assertion is likely to be removed. Being verifiable is even more important, and as you said, not ''everything'' that is written here sticks. [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 16:58, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:::*Let me know when you find a dominant player in the market using the IEC prefixes. Not even one single manufacturer of RAM, such as [http://www.crucial.com/search/searchresults.aspx?keywords=GB Crucial] (the most logical segment of the computer industry that would adopt such terminology) uses the IEC prefixes. The proposal failed. Don’t you understand that yet? I’ll find a citation later. Or ''you'' can add the citation (it’s called “collaborative writing”). Don’t delete an indisputable truth just because you don’t like the truth and I don’t have time to dig up a citation at the moment. It’s going to be tough to cite because about the world’s RSs ''don’t even talk'' about the whole issue of the IEC prefixes; POV-pushers on ''Wikipedia'' are the only ones discussing them as they try to '''Keep the Dream Alive'''®™© by getting them mentioned and linked at every turn and aliased beyond all comprehension so other editors can’t easily discern that there are multiple links in the same sentence to the same article. Pure silliness.<p>Mind you, all this fuss is about trying to mention the IEC prefixes in an article on '''''hard drives''''' of all things, which is an industry that uses ''decimal math'' to define the magnitude of the conventional prefixes and <u>wouldn’t even use the IEC prefixes</u> if the terminology were actually used elsewhere. Words like “mebibyte” aren’t even in the Microsoft® Computer Dictionary. It’s been 15 years and all the players in RAM are ''still'' using the terminology we all know.  Be happy that the IEC prefixes are mentioned in this article at all. My stripping out any mention was because it wasn’t necessary for that section or this article; adding it back was a concession to make peace with the IEC proponents (I know: overly optimistic). As the topic of the IEC prefixes is currently addressed, it is at least informative and accurate—if not a bit off-topic. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 17:10, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::As I said, what I understand or not is irrelevant to the discussion; I'm only trying to ensure that Wikipedia content policies are met in the article, given that those for collaboration are not being followed in the talk page. I don't care whether the IEC prefixes are mentioned or not, I'm not here to advocate their usage by the industry; what I care is that the ''Capacity measurements'' section at the ''Hard disk drive'' article at Wikipedia explains that measuring capacity of hard drives has lead to significant confusion through the years, and that prominent agents in the industry tried to solve it in various forms (one of which is the IEC proposal, but I don't care whether that particular one is used here); ''those'' are significant facts about the topic, and trying to suppressing them amounts to some bit of POV-pushing of your own. We don't need your condescension for their inclusion, only that regular consensus-forming processes are respected.
:::::Nor I have the least intention to delete the sentence myself, I'll just add a [citation needed] tag until someone finds a good source for it. As I already said I'm not familiar with the MOSNUM, so I assumed good faith and presumed that you would be eager to support that reference given that you've been at this talk page for weeks, waving that "undeniable fact" (irrelevant to Wikipedia pillars, btw) as justification for your inordinate defense of your posture; you should have found that reference much earlier, and not dared to introduce that assertion into a contended section without it. Now that the section is taking good shape I hope that you stay [[WP:COOL|cool]] and in the future you will strive to try to use some [[WP:WikiLove]]. Now if you go and re-read my three original concerns under this light you'll find that what you've added to this section so far is completely orthogonal to them, since I'm not trying to push for the IEC prefixes. ;-) [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 17:50, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::*Very well. Peace. Hopefully someone can find a statement by an RS that proves a negative about an issue not even being discussed in the computing world. It seems to me it would be easier to show ''through elimination'', the links to all the major players proving they ''don’t'' use the IEC prefixes than find an RS discussing this obscure subject stating they don’t. [[User:Swtpc6800|SWTPC6800]] is amazingly good at this sort of thing. It’s like my writing “[[Klingon language|Klingon]] is a constructed fad language that hasn’t seen any adoption in mainstream populations.”{{fact}} What the heck?!? What RS to whom we might cite would want to write on such a topic? I still suspect the proper way to prove obviousness is to challenge ''you'' to show me one single major player in the computing world that uses the IEC prefixes.

:::::: The verifiability policy is crystal clear that the [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence| burden of evidence]] relies on the editor who adds material to the article; if you want to add content about the major HD players or the popularity of Klingon in mainstream populations, you better have a reliable reference that can be cited as the source. That said, I'm perfectly fine with using an enumeration of some major HD builders which can be verified to not use IEC, instead of an unsourced assertion about all the (unknown to the reader) major players.

I've reworded the sentence that introduced the correspondences between decimal prefixes and their assigned power-of-two values. That one was again using the term 'binary' to describe a decimal value that happens to be a power of two. I've also changed there the link to [[binary prefix]], since that article is not only about the IEC prefixes but about this precise usage of decimal prefixes when used to represent powers of two.

I really think the last paragraph would be improved if the sentence "...by proposing unique binary prefixes and prefix symbols to use for denoting powers of 1024" would directly link to the [[unique binary prefix]]es section; even if that article is already linked to, this second link is really about a different concept and a direct link would help the interested reader.

== The real history of computing ==

The Capacity measurements section has the statement.
<blockquote> Since 2<sup>10</sup> is within a few percent of 1000, computer scientists in the early days of computing referred to a computer with 2<sup>10</sup> bytes of memory as having a ''kilobyte'' of memory even though the prefix ''[[kilo-]]'' properly refers to precisely 1000.</blockquote>
If we are being pedantic here, this statement is wrong. Many early computers came with 4K, 8K, 12K or 16K words of memory. Computers like the [[IBM 1401]] used decimal addressing so 4K was 4000 words and 16K was 16,000 words. The K was exactly 1000, not 1024. The 1401 was the most successful commercial computer in the early 1960s with over 10,000 system installed. (IBM received [http://www.ibm.com/ibm100/us/en/icons/mainframe/ 5200 orders] in the first five weeks, an early iPhone frenzy.)

== IBM 1401 core memory matrix ==

The [[IBM 1401]] had 4000, eight-bit words-worth of magnetic-core memory. 

There are 12 factor pairs of 4,000: 
# 4000 = 1 x 4000
# 4000 = 2 x 2000
# 4000 = 4 x 1000
# 4000 = 5 x 800
# 4000 = 8 x 500
# 4000 = 10 x 400
# 4000 = 16 x 250
# 4000 = 20 x 200
# 4000 = 25 x 160
# 4000 = 32 x 125
# 4000 = 40 x 100
# 4000 = 50 x 80

None of these is a square. The memory could have been divided into ten frames, each with 400 bits, in which case the eight factors for 400 are…

# 400 = 1 x 400 
# 400 = 2 x 200 
# 400 = 4 x 100 
# 400 = 5 x 80 
# 400 = 8 x 50 
# 400 = 10 x 40 
# 400 = 16 x 25 
# 400 = 20 x 20

I’m guessing it was 8 banks, each with 10 core panels, each panel comprising 400 (20 × 20) ferrite beads (32,000 bits of 8-bit words = 4000 words total). Anyone know for sure?  [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 17:47, 24 April 2011 (UTC)
== Non-“digressions” that are actually the ''point'' ==

Woodstone: I don’t agree at all with {{diff|Hard disk drive|prev|425805890|this edit}} nor the reasoning as outlined in your edit summary: ''simplify by removing digressions''. Simplifying is fine; I spent a lot of time streamlining and simplifying my own text. But that sentence you tried to strip out told of the early days of computing with magnetic core memory and how—unlike today—it was in decimal form so “1 KB” of memory truly meant 1000 bytes. That is ''not'' something our typical readership would know and a full and proper exposition of the subject matter is is the whole point of an encyclopedia.

Thus, that sentence and the information it conveys is ''highly germane'' to the discussion of how past practices with terminology and capacity measurement (the ''very topic'' of that section) morphed and diverged through time to the present state of affairs. It also doesn’t hurt that the sentence ought to actually be ''interesting'' to much of our readership on a subject that can be rather dry at times. How about more “typey-typey” and less “deletey” while we’re “building the project”?

As for the ''footnote:'' that’s where “digressions” belong; particularly when they explain a glaring inconsistency: why some of the quoted examples given in the body text (like “1KB”) don’t have spaces between their values and their symbols whereas other body text and the table ''does'' have spaces. Thus, the footnote is a ''germane'' digression and a footnote is precisely where that explanation belongs. The footnote might also help avert drive-by-shootings as I.P.s try to “fix” these inconsistencies by making some uppercase “K”s into lowercase ones… because they’re in 5th grade and just learned about the SI and how the symbol for ''kilo-'' is ''k''.

I was careful to not disturb Diego’s intervening edits as they all made perfect sense to me.  [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 14:40, 25 April 2011 (UTC)

== K was used as a binary 1024 as early as 1959 ==

[[Image:IBM 1401 Control Panel.jpg|thumb| A working IBM 1401 at the Computer History Museum.]]
The hard disk article should explain why a new 1 TB drive only shows 931 GB. However the dual use of K for 1000 and 1024 did not start in 1969 with the Intel 1102 DRAM. This date is off by a full decade.  Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base-2) or decimal (base-10). For instance, the [[IBM 701]] (1952) used binary and could address 2,048 36-bit words, while the [[IBM 702]] (1953) used decimal and could address 10,000 7-bit words.  The use of ''K'' in the binary sense as in a "32k core" can be found as early as 1959.
*{{cite journal | last = Real | first = P. | title = A generalized analysis of variance program utilizing binary logic. | journal = ACM '59: Preprints of papers presented at the 14th national meeting of the Association for Computing Machinery | pages = pp. 78-1 – 78-5 | date = September 1959 | doi = 10.1145/612201.612294 | publisher = ACM Press |quote = On a '''32k core''' size 704 computer, approximately 28,000 datum may be analyzed, … without resorting to auxiliary tape storage.}}
The [[IBM 704]] core memory units had 4096 36-bit words. Up to 32,768 words could be installed.

The dominate computers in the early 1960s used decimal addressing and calculations. The Winter 2010 issue of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine (Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MSSC.2009.935295) has a 12 page article on the 50th anniversary of the IBM 1401 Data Processing System. Here are a few quotes.

"The 1401 was very successful. By 1965, half of the approximately 26,000 computers in the world were 1400-family machines—models 1401, 1410, 1440, 1460, and 7010. The total number of 1400-family computers peaked at about 15,000 systems in 1967."

"The 1401 processor sequentially processed 6-bit characters or decimal digits. A single character or digit was stored per memory position, and strings of characters or digits could be arbitrarily long (up to the size of memory)."

"Memory ranged in capacity from an entry-level system with 1,400 positions to a maximum of 16,000 positions, with each position holding 8 bits: a 6-bit character or digit, a variable-length data and variable-length instruction flag called the 'word mark', and a memory 'check bit' with odd parity."

"Given its digit-serial arithmetic, 50 cycles, or approximately 0.5 ms, were required to add two positive 20-digit numbers. Today’s 4-GHz PC can add two 64-bit numbers about a million times faster."

Honeywell built a clone in 1963. "The H200 was offered with so-called 'Liberator' software that could run 1401 programs unmodified and more quickly than a 1401."

The binary addressed [[IBM 360]] replaced the 1400 family but it included hardware that could emulate the 1401 instructions so customers could continue to run their existing software. You can see a 1401 up running at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View CA.

== A plea for sanity ==

The capacity measurement section has evolved into a miniature version of the Binary Prefix article written IMO from the POV of the proponents of the use of '''conventional binary prefixes''' in the use of reporting HDD capacity.  This is an HDD article not a RAM article or the Binary Prefix article.  Most of the added stuff lends nothing to the article (I agree with the editor who tagged much of it with "why").  I think I have made it into a fairly concise and neutral article including reliable sources for most of what I added. Some specific reasons behind my changes:
*There were all sorts of different ways of saying the same thing, i tried to standardize on ''powers of xxxx'' which seems to have consensus although I would personally prefer something like decimal/binary
*I don't think TB is an approved JEDEC standard nor is it used by an OS, so it is gone from binary.
*The issues is the reporting of capacity by the OS and utilities, somehow that got lost.  There was a great debate in the Binary Prefix discussion as to why the OSes started using '''conventional binary prefixes''' instead of IEC decimal prefixes, the CNET quote i cite is a reliable source which avoids the why but puts the consequences into perspective.
Since this has nothing do to with IEC Binary Prefixes I hope the thought police will discuss this rather than reflexively reverting my edit.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:52, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

My two cents: Greg L's text goes into a lot of unnecessary detail about 20th century history which could IMO be cut down, but in no way can I see how it is “from the POV of the proponents of the use of conventional binary prefixes”: it just describes the situation, and it doesn't advocate or criticize anything. On the other hand, Tom94022's text is a bit shorter, but commentary like “[t]here is really no reason for this difference besides it just being convention to use powers of 1024 in reporting memory size” and “[a]ltering this practice to use conventional powers of 1000 could have been done at any time, including from the beginning; however, for some reason it just stuck this way for most of the computing industry” definitely doesn't belong here. Given that this article is supposed to be about f***ing hard disks rather than RAM, units, or anything else, my preference would be to stick with Greg L's text but with the paragraph about 1953–76 history reduced to a couple of sentences (to the effect of “both those sets of units have decades of precedent”) or even removed altogether. ― [[User:A. di M.|A. di&nbsp;M.]]​<sub lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">[[User talk:A. di M.|plé]]</sub>​<sup lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">[[Special:Contributions/A. di M.|dréachtaí]]</sup> 12:10, 27 April 2011 (UTC)
: I support this reduction - elaborating the specific models that originated each convention is too detailed for a ''Capacity measurements'' section. IMHO a link to [[Binary_prefix#Disk_drives]] would be advisable as the subject is treated as on-topic there. Another option is to split the section in two - one half for the technical details on how capacity is measured (including the math description), the other for its historical evolution (origins, changes in operating systems, and the proposal of unique prefixes). This way succinctness would not be crucial and each section could digress a little more. [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 13:07, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

If we over-scrutinize that section and start second-guessing ourselves while under the pressure of absurd rants, we could trim the article down to just 30% of what’s there. Would it still convey information if so trimmed? Sure, but there is not only no ''need'' to, we don’t ''want to'' because doing so would harm that section; what’s there now is well crafted, crisp, accurate text that provides concise account of the following:

::<b>Topic: How the measure of binary capacity is confusing and even lead to lawsuits</b>
:# The hard drive industry uses zeros in their measure of HDD capacity whereas other areas use 1024-based measure
:# That practice isn’t something new and has its roots in the earliest days of computing
:# The early days of computing also used 1024 math in computing and used the conventional prefixes for that too
:# The 1024 convention stuck for RAM and other and decimal math stuck for hard drives
:# This lead to and still leads to confusion and lawsuits
:# Now two dominant OS vendors have two different practices for measuring HDD capacity (further increasing confusion)

:::Greg L's summary is close to what I tried to write with one crucial and several minor distinctions, as follows:
:::<b>Topic: How the reporting of HDD <strike>measure of binary</strike> capacity is confusing<strike> and even lead to lawsuits</strike></b>
:::# The hard drive industry uses <strike>zeros</strike> ''powers of 1000'' in their measure of HDD capacity whereas <strike>other areas use</strike> ''the memory industry uses a powers of 1024''-based measure
:::# <strike>That practice isn’t</strike>''Neither practice is'' something new and has its roots in the earliest days of computing
:::# <strike>The early days of computing also used 1024 math in computing and used the conventional prefixes for that too</strike><br/>[Note: No one uses or has ever used 1024 '''math''' in '''computing'''; such prefixes are used in stating capacity in articles, product literature, etc.  This bullet appears to me to be redundant to the above so rather than reword, I struck it.]
:::# The ''powers of 1024'' convention stuck for memory<strike>RAM and other</strike> and ''powers of 1000''<strike>decimal math</strike> stuck for hard drives
:::# <strike>This lead to and still leads to confusion and lawsuits</strike>  '''There was no confusion until OSes and/or utilities began reporting HDD capacity using the memory capacity convention, that is powers of 1024'''.
:::# [http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10330509-263.html '''Altering this practice to use conventional powers of 1000 could have been done at any time, including from the beginning; however, for some reason it just stuck this way for most of the computing industry.''']
:::# Now two dominant OS vendors have two different practices for '''reporting'''<strike>measuring</strike> HDD capacity (further increasing confusion)
:::# A standards body tried to address the confusion with new prefixes but they largely ignored by the computing world.
:::Just the facts sir. What I proposed sticks to the above outline, is crisp, '''truly accurate''' and concise, is ''actually interesting reading'' (a too-rare thing on Wikipedia).  This is an HDD article not the Binary Prefix article.  It seems to me that as written it has an overwhelming emphasis on the powers of 1024 usage in computing which is POV but it is also TMI.  Greg L gives away his bias in the title of his summary, "How the reporting of binary capacity is confusing ..."  The article is about HDDs and the confusion comes from the unfortunate practice of OSes using binary prefixes for reporting HDD capacity.  That is the crucial point missed!
:::FWIW, I note that many of the changes I made should not be controversial, such as standardizing on the ''powers of xxxx''' language or removing the excess justification of binary prefixes (as proposed by A. di. M and Diego Moya).  Instead of trying to further improve the article Greg L simply reverted as I expected. The only really controversial points I suspect are 6 and 7 in my summary, as opposed to 5 in GregL's summary.  This could have been discussed rather than throwing the whole thing out. I further note that my proposed revision reduced the size of the article by about 600 bytes while adding substantial new reliably sourced material.

{{od}}
If you want to contribute, Tom94022, just don’t sit back, allow five editors to work on something for a week, and then come back after a three-day off-wiki absence and throw much of it out and substitute it with your own. What were you ''thinking??'' That we’d all go “OK, he threw out all our work so let’s ''*discuss*'' it after the fact”? You’ve argued and argued for weeks here and have agitated beyond all comprehension that the table ought to have the IEC prefixes in it. Your bias is clear with regard to those IEC prefixes and your contempt for the way the world really works is palpable. The clear consensus here is not aligned with your wishes. You are overruled. Then five editors collaboratively work on that section for days and and ''then'' you tried that little stunt of yours and proclaimed some sort of victory because you were prescient that you’d be reverted, which was a [http://members.iinet.net.au/~jez/junk/well-duh.jpg Well, ''DUH''] outcome given how inappropriate your move was.

Please just give it up. The consensus '''''is not''''' in agreement with you. We find that there is '''no''' POV-pushing to promote the standard prefixes going on here. Period. What ''you'' think is *'''truly'''* accurate is not what the rest of us think, which underlies why you aren’t getting your way… because Wikipedia operates by consensus.

As I mentioned above, what’s there sticks to the above-mentioned outline, is crisp, accurate and concise, is ''actually interesting reading'' (a too-rare thing on Wikipedia) because of SWTPC6800’s help, and was the product of a good handful of editors laboring on it over many days. The last thing we need now is wholesale deletion of passages by someone who <u>stayed away</u> during the collaborative writing process and comes back alleging that the article had been taken over by biased “'''thought police'''” trying to push a particular industry practice. That sort of allegation is just utterly absurd.  [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 17:14, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

===Why isn't this POV pushing===
Some of my fellow editors do not see POV pushing in this article.  Please look carefully at these two adjacent sentences from my recent edit already reverted by GregL:
{{quote box
|title = The HDD Sentence 
|quote= The practice of using prefixes assigned to powers of 1000 within the hard drive industry dates back to the early days of computing.
|align = center
|width = 70%
|bgcolor = yellow
}} 
versus
{{quote box 
|title = The Memory Sentence 
|quote= Likewise, the practice of using prefixes assigned to powers of 1024 within the memory industry dates back to the early days of computing; other computers with up to 32,768 words of memory referred to them as “32k words.”<sup>[20][21][22][23][24]</sup>
|align = center
|width = 70%
|bgcolor = yellow
}}
Why does the '''Memory Sentence''' require an example and five footnotes while the '''HDD Sentence''' has neither an example nor any footnotes.  We could easily add an example and 5 or more footnotes to the '''HDD Sentence''' to get to a balanced section or drop them all and point to the Binary Prefix article.  IMO, the unbalanced and heavy emphasis on examples of '''conventional binary prefixes''' in an HDD article is pushing the POV that reporting HDD capacity using such prefixes is somehow justified.

This is how the section looks when [[User:Diego_Moya/Capacity_measurements#Reactions_to_the_discrepancy|split in subsections]]. Thoughts? [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 21:18, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

* Fabulous! Outstanding work, Diego. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 21:21, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

Are there any early usages of powers of 1024 in the storage industry other than in the memory segment?  I don't think so. So I think the first sentence should read:
{{quote box
|quote=The practices of using prefixes assigned to powers of 1000 within the hard drive industry <strike>(storage)</strike> and prefixes assigned to powers of 1024 within the memory <strike>and storage </strike>industry both date back to the early days of computing.
|width=70%
|align=center
}}

At least three of us agreed that the history of conventional binary prefixes was unnecessary, even confusing, and we then all agreed to move it to footnotes. I don't understand how we now improve the article by bring it back.  Also, this material is all about memory; if we are going to have lots of memory history shouldn't we have an equal amount of HDD history?  IMO, neither are particularly helpful, but I will be happy to find five or more HDD examples to add to the early history section.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:06, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

BTW, the first section title, Early discrepancies is also probably inappropriate.  None of the examples illustrate any discrepancy but instead illustrate the development of two different meanings of the same symbols. Each example has a consistent usage.  To illustrate a discrepancy should you find an example of an HDD being described with powers of 1024 prefix or a memory being described with a powers of 1000 prefix.  You might find some of the latter early say a 64 Kbit memory being described as a 65 kbit memory but I doubt if you will find any HDD examples until the 1980s.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:15, 27 April 2011 (UTC)
::I didn't actually think it was unnecessary, only that it was too long to be placed properly at the middle of the section. In my proposed split this is no longer a concern, so if we make that change I think it can be expanded to include some well-sourced examples of 1000-prefixed descriptions of HDDs. Maybe the section could be called ''Early examples'' or any other appropriate description of what content is included in it. What more would you add to this history section? [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 08:35, 28 April 2011 (UTC)

If you take a careful walk through the [[Timeline of binary prefixes]] I think you will find that the memory industry was inconsistently used kilo or k (or K) and mega or M in either sense into the 1970s but has been pretty much consistent since then.  You will also find that the HDD industry has always used mega or M, giga or G and tera or T in a decimal sense.  There are no examples of M being applied to an HDD in a binary sense until the 1980s.  I don't think there are any example of k (or K) ever being applied to a disk drive, the first one was 5 ''million'' characters.  One of the first storage examples in the early 1980s is with FDs when Apple starting using K (binary) to describe the SA400 which was specified in decimal units.  I think all of this early history is irrelevant to the HDD article and at most should be footnoted but if we are going to summarize the history it out to truly depict the whole history and not just some memory aspects thereof.

* Seven editors seem to be happy with what five editors did, one of whom was Diego, and another of whom was me. I for one am still happy with the consensus text and find your arguments, Tom94022, to be unpersuasive. I support Diego’s efforts here and it is clear he understands the intent of the consensus editors. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 23:00, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

::I have a problem with the attempt to trace the use of decimal numbers to measure hard drive capacity to core memory practice, in particular the IBM 702 (which employed Williams tubes, not core, by the way). The 702 and its core successor, the 705, used decimal addressing.  It was in the binary addressed machines, like the 701,704, 709, series where power-of-two memory capacity was the norm and where the practice of K meaning 1024 arose. In any case, core memory has little to do with hard drives. The first hard drive, the IBM 350, part of the [[IBM 305 RAMAC]] stored exactly 5 million characters.  Then, as now, the capacity of a hard drive is the number of active disk surfaces X the number of sectors per surface X the number of storage elements per sector. This rarely comes out as a power of two. --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 01:16, 29 April 2011 (UTC)

{{outdent}}As [[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] eloquently states [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hard_disk_drive&action=history directly above], there is "a problem with the attempt to trace the use of decimal numbers to measure hard drive capacity to core memory practice, in particular the IBM 702 (which employed Williams tubes, not core, by the way). ... In any case, core memory has little to do with hard drives."

To which I will '''again state''' it seems unbalanced in these two sentences of an HDD article to have 5 or 6 footnoted examples of the early usage of ''powers of 1024'' measurements of memory and no footnotes regarding the early usage ''powers of 1000'' measurements of HDDs.  It would be nice now to see some discussion <s>as opposed to [[Ad hominem]] attacks and circular reasoning</s>.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 01:09, 3 May 2011 (UTC)

* Very good. That the 702 used Williams tubes needs to be fixed. I see no problem—and certainly no non-sequitor—mentioning how the very earliest days of computing used the term “K” or “k” to denote both 1000 and 1024. It lays the foundation for the entire basis as to how the measuring convention for hard drive capacity ran afoul with the expectation of computer users because of the commonly understood value of 1024. It is not only ''not'' a non-sequitor, such a discussion speaks straight to the heart of what that section is about. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 03:47, 3 May 2011 (UTC)
::Thank you - by splitting the sentence you removed the non-sequitor.  The second sentence is irrelevant TMI since it does not cite the use of prefixes of either sort, this has not be discussed hereinbefore on this discussion page.  You did not discuss the lack of balance in this paragraph and to date hereinbefore there has been no discussion of balance or the lack thereof.

== Some perspective ==

There seems to be a bit of unnecessary wiki drama going on here. I'm late to the party, but would like to try to calm things down. I've been involved with electronics and computers since the late 1950s. Here is my version of what happened. We can see if others have a different recollection and also what we can source to meet wikipedia standards for inclusion.

# The use of the letters k and K to mean 1000 was universal in the electronics industry since before Wold War II. Frequency was measured in kilocycles (kc), high levels of power were in kilowatts, (KW), and resistances above 1000 ohms were  listed on schematics as just K.  Also resistance values generally quoted were approximate. High quality resistors had a ± 5% tolerance. Consumer grade was ± 20%.
# Memory on the earliest computers was small, too small perhaps to bother abbreviating. The binary Whirlwind I had 2048 words. The decimal IBM 650 (the one I first learned on) had 2000 words of drum memory (50 words of core was an option). 
# The use of K was only potentially ambiguous in discussing memory size of binary machines. In that context, it had two possible meanings: approximate size to the nearest thousand, and multiple of 1024. It is important to note that this distinction has no effect for powers of 2 until 2^16 = 65536, which becomes either 65K or 64K depending on which was meant. There are examples of both usages. Binary memory sizes this big did not become common until the early 1960s. The IBM 704/709/7090/7040 series, which were the most popular large binary machines until the mid-1960s, only had 15 bit addresses.  The IBM 7030 STRETCH had a larger address space, but few machines were built. 
# IBM was very formal in it documentation and avoided slang usage. Hardware manuals I have give storage sizes exactly in decimal (e.g. 32,768 words). I believe the use of abbreviations like 8K or 16K come in with IBMs software documentation, particularly when giving the minimum memory size needed to run a program or system.
# The earliest commercial hard disk drive, on the IBM 305 had exactly 5 million characters. The capacity of hard disk drives (then and now) come from a formula: the number of active disk surfaces times the number of tracks per surface times the number of sectors per track times the number of memory elements per sectors.  In most cases numbers in the formula were not powers of two. I'm not aware of any tradition in the IBM world, which invented hard drives and dominated the early market for them, of expressing disk memory sizes in binary multiples. The use of binary sizes for hard drives seems to have surfaced when hard drive were first used on personal computers. --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 18:31, 4 May 2011 (UTC)

:Welcome to the discussion.  I agree with everything you say, most of which is said in the [[Binary prefix]] article but perhaps not as well or as succinctly.  To clarify one of your points there is no record of application of binary prefixes to HDDs until the middle 1980s when it was most likely first done by Apple with an early MAC OS.  Prior to the MAC, as best I can discover all OSes and/or their utilities reported capacity in long strings of decimal digits, often without commas.  
:IMO, the current wording of this article places much too much emphasis on the history of conventional binary prefixes in memory and both ignores the history of decimal prefixes in HDD capacity and the timing of this change in reporting.  Unfortunately every attempt I have made to improve the article has been shouted down with the canard that I am editing against consensus.  The points you and I raise have not been discussed so editing them into the article is not against any consensus, but that doesn't stop the shouting.

Maybe we can put the past behind us and AGF, etc. I'd like to hear from the others why they think addressing on a decimal machine is relevant here.--22:13, 4 May 2011 (UTC)
::Can I broaden the question to ask why is any history is relevant here?  And as a follow up. if we mush have history in this article why isn't the history of HDD capacity measurements the only relevant history in an HDD article?

== /* Power consumption */ ==

'''adjusting spin speeds according to transfer rates''' is a semi-regularly repeated myth, but I am pretty certain it is just that.  All modern hard disks spin at a constant angular velocity (after initial spin-up from standing).  Confusion on this matter began a few years ago when a HDD manufacturer made a vague claim that one of their upcoming drives would change velocity to save power - this was either marketing puff or talking about a semi-sleep mode with the platter spinning slowly but with the head moved off the platter (to avoid a head crash due to the lack of required air-flow to float the head above the platter surface).  Variable angular velocities would lead to obvious audible pitch changes (which I have never heard or heard of in practise), and could not be done both quickly and accurately at the same time, due to the intertial input requirement to change velocity and the precise control of RPMs required for in-flight head position and read/write timing calculations.  Feel free to correct me on this, but I've never seen or heard of this.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/94.195.131.27|94.195.131.27]] ([[User talk:94.195.131.27|talk]]) 03:38, 5 May 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:I am pretty sure that the Western Digital drive's IntelliPower algorithm varies the rotational speed between 5400RPM and 7200RPM and that Seagate and Toshiba have similar capabilities with other names.  Technically with drives already implementing zone bit recording this shouldn't be too difficult since all it means is tweaking the data separator's lock range and tracking capabilities.  Slow change is actually better and you won't hear a thing.  Obviously there is a limit to the range but with modern negative air bearing heads the flying height doesn't change much, if at all, within a fairly large RPM band (as indeed it doesn't change much from inner to outer tracks)  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 18:09, 5 May 2011 (UTC)

== Balance ==

In my latest edit there are three basic changes to the [[Hard_disk_drive#Capacity_measurements|Capacity measurements]] section of the article:
===Balance===
:<strike>I believe the section is unbalanced in that it has too much information on the history of binary prefixes to describe memory and none on the history of decimal prefixes to describe HDDs so in order to balance the article I added information on usage of decimal prefixes to describe HDD capacity.</strike>
:::Thanks to edits by Diego the section is now balanced, although it should be improved by moving the main memory history to footnotes as is the HDD history [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 17:08, 25 May 2011 (UTC)  
===Dubious===
Moved discussion to new section, [[Talk:Hard_disk_drive#Usage of Binary K|Usage of Binary K]]
===New Material===
:<strike>I added from a reliable source a paragraph on the lack of a basis for using ''powers or 1024'' in reporting HDD capacity.</strike>
::I accept Diego's edit to this new material, although I do think the fact that the confusion did not appear until the 1980s is material, so I will look for a way to add it without citing Wikipedia.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 15:39, 26 May 2011 (UTC)
:::Please do so, though I'm afraid that will be difficult. The source you find will have to state that some usage of binary prefixes in HDD was the ''first'' one and/or that confusion appeared about those years. [[User:Diego Moya|Diego Moya]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 15:58, 26 May 2011 (UTC)
On the whole, I would rather eliminate all of this history from this article but if we must have history then I suggest an HDD article should at least have HDD history.  

I hope no one reverts this edit on the basis of "editing against consensus."  I would note that this edit is added material and two dubious tags; none of this has been discussed before so it is not possible for there to have been any consensus since there has been no discussion.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 21:45, 21 May 2011 (UTC)

:* See below. I reverted in large part because the result was very poor technical writing and nothing but more of your POV-pushing. As regards this amazing leap of logic of yours: {{xt| so it is not possible for there to have been any consensus since there has been no discussion}}, you confuse the community not being interested in further entertaining your tendentiousness and your [[Wikipedia:Drop the stick and back slowly away from the horse carcass|flogging a dead horse]] as being equivalent to acquiescing with your arguments; that was your goof here.

== POV-pushing (again) ==

This edit ({{diff|Hard disk drive|prev|430257023|∆ edit 430257023}}) by [[User:Tom94022]] was more of the same old POV-pushing and I reverted it. The result ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&oldid=430257023#Capacity here]) was tediously long, poorly written and clearly was a step backwards from the previous version which was tight, pithy, and spoke to the point; and was the product of a smooth, collaborative effort of a handful of experienced and accomplished editors. I reverted  ({{diff|Hard disk drive|prev|430413460|∆ edit here}}) to the last good version, which was after I.P. 193.210.145.13 made a contribution, and after Tom94022 reverted the addition of a graphic by User:Cmglee, which indeed wasn’t  a helpful graphic and was an edit by Tom94022 with which I agree.

== DMahalko's Edit ==

While I appreciate DMahalko's trying to smooth it all over by an intro to the capacity section, summarizing all the many possible size discrepancies I think the material doesn't add very much and in many ways is incorrect.  A short summary might help, but this long list appears to me to be too much.  Some issues
:*The total number of sectors and the size of the sectors
::There is no ambiguity here
:*computer filesystems must allocate space for tracking disk sector usage, storing file names, and keeping track of a directory structure
::True, but that is the difference between gross and net, no ambiguity here
:Absolute physical characteristics such as areal density are not reliable for determining storage capacity, and actual capacity is usually lower:
:*Its true but so what.  There is no reliable way to determine capacity from areal density based upon manufacturers published numbers.

== Usage of Binary K ==

:I marked two of the historical examples of binary prefixes as dubious for the following reasons:
:*The Sept 59 article by P Real of Westinghouse is a mathematical paper and does not explicitly link his usage of 32k to k=1024.  As was practice in that time period the author could have been truncating 32,768 to 32k.  This obscure first instance of k possibly in a binary sense in the [[Timeline of binary prefixes]] hardly supports the generalization, "computers were said to have 32k words."  A far better example would be the Amdahl or Bell papers of 1964.
:::BTW, I would point out that this sentence derives from GregL's original editing and therefore he should be careful about violating [[WP:Own]]. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:50, 25 May 2011 (UTC)
:*With regard to the 1102 [or 1103], there is no evidence that Intel ever "marketed it as a “1K” or 1 kilobit chip".  The Intel 1973 Memory Handbook does not use any form of k or kilo in a binary sense and I have not been able to find any contemporaneous evidence of such usage.  The two footnotes are tangential to this dubious sentence.  It's not clear when the Semiconductor industry began using binary prefixes - we may have to go to 64 kbit chips circa 1979.
:::To further explain my point I did a search in IEEE Xplore (1968-1975) looking for "(1k or 4k or 16k) and memory" and got 104 hits with the earliest semiconductor example being "The set of memory boards is partitioned into modules of 4K words by 32 bits" from Megabit bipolar LSI memory systems: IV, 1970 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference. Digest of Technical Papers, Feb 1970, from Fairchild.  The earliest Intel cite is 1973.  It is difficult to prove a negative, on the other hand there is simply no evidence to support this sentence.

The use of uppercase K to denote 1000 was common in the electronics industry before computers were invented. Look at any schematic diagram from the period. Standardizing on lowercase k was initiated by the introduction of SI in 1960 to avoid confusing with the symbol for Kelvin. SI was adopted by NBS in the US in 1964 (NBS Administrative Bulletin 64-6 issued Feb 1964, per NASA SP-7012) and took many years to gain wide acceptance. Same for the space between number and unit. One publisher I work with insists on no space. In any case, this issue does not belong in an article on hard disk drives. Also people using K for memory, as in 16K or 32K, were mostly using it as an approximation, as was common in the electronics industry for other values, such as resistance or voltage. The distinction begins to get serious at 64K (or is it 65K, both were used).  It became very important for the System/360 architecture with its 24 bit address space. (128K vs 131K, 256K vs 262K, etc.) Amdahl may have been the first to make the 1K=1024 statement explicit. And all this precedes solid state memory. I would suggest the following wording (note corrected values for M and G):

::Hi Arnold:  I have no problem with dropping footnote 2 regarding k vs K as TMI; I'd already cut it back from the original edit by GregL. I am less certain about changing the second sentence from semiconductor advent to main memory size as the driver to making K meaning 1024 common.  Perhaps both.  And perhaps the threshold should be 64 KiB since it absent a qualifier such as in the Amdahl article it is simply not clear whether by K an author meant nK = n * 1034 or nK ~ n * 1000.

::I took a look a Phister, Data Processing Technology and Economics - he shows the average memory size on both IBM and other computers in 1969 as 60 kB (decimal) so that occurs long before semiconductor usage.  This suggests semiconductor is at least as important as memory size.  Or maybe both are just coincidence.  We may be getting close to OR here as is indeed the original sentence.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 00:33, 27 May 2011 (UTC)

:::I don't think average memory size has any relevance here. Then as now there were many more small machines than big ones. It was the capacity of large machines that drove the K/M usage. When IBM announced the 360 in 1964, they spoke of ''core storage memory'' up to 8,000,000 characters see [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PR360.html]. In 1969 the 360/65 at MIT's computation center had 256 or 512 K of core memory. Semiconductor memory had nothing to do with it. And even semiconductor memory was not consistent in usage. I have some 64K memory chips whose part numbers use "65" to indicate size. This is in the early 80s. --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 03:42, 27 May 2011 (UTC)

::::It may not.  I think in an edit now archived you made the point that IBM was very careful in its documentation and didn't use the terms K or M in any sense, preferring either to state an exact decimal number to whatever digits necessary or using thousand and/or million.  I think that's true.  So when and what led to first the "common" use of "K" in a binary sense and then "M"?  As near as I can tell it was not "common" until sometime in the 1970s certainly a long time after "introduction of main memory larger than 32,768 addressable units" - that is long after 1964.  BTW I looked at the original PDP8 manual, mainly used 4,096 with a few 4Ks.  Intel didn't use "K" on the 1103.  When did it become "common"?  Perhaps the whole sentence needs work.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 04:49, 27 May 2011 (UTC)

First of all, remember we are talking about mostly informal usage. The was no overarching committee telling everyone what to do (any more than there is now). I'm sure IBM did have strict style guides for customer documentation, but more technical stuff got more leeway. Note that the 360 announcement I link to above talks about "8,000,000 characters", when the actual number is 8,388,608. The usage K=1024 was common in the IBM 360 era and that starts well before 1970. And IBM dominated the computer industry then. A couple of examples: 1. http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/fortran/Y28-6601-1_FORTRAN_E_PLM.pdf from 1966, Appendix J page 137: "Figures ... reflect the main storage allocation associated with each successive phase/interlude as it performs its functions, when only a minimal amount of storage (15K bytes, where K =1024) is available for compilation." 2. http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/#timeline Dec 1968: "IBM 360 equipment at the end of 1968 consisted of [24]: * Model 75 CPU 2075 with 2.5 million bytes of memory. * Two processor storage units 2365 (512K total) ..." Remember the 360 changed two things, it increased address space to 24 bits and used byte addressing. An IBM 7090 introduced in late 1959, maxed out at, and typically came with, 32,768 words of  36-bit core memory. If that size memory is converted to byte addressing, it would already be at 128K  or more. So the issue of what K meant came up in common usage as soon as higher end 360s (e.g. the 65 and 75) started shipping. And these were core machines. This usage for K was not universal. I found a DEC PDP 11 Peripherals and Interfacing Handbook from 1971 that says on p.63: "Disk systems range from the RC11/RS64 which has a basic storage of 65K words (expandable to 262K)..." Later on the page it makes clear that 65K and 262K mean 65,536 and 262,144.  But IBM had huge clout and, in my opinion, esthetics were on their side. Numbers like 131K, 262K, and 524K conveyed less meaning to programmers than 128K, 256K and 512K. And again, none of this has anything to do with solid state memory.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 19:50, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
:The proposed sentence uses the term '''common''' not '''informal.''' Actually I think you have made the case that neither the advent of semiconductor memory not address sizes > 32 KiB has any correlation to the '''common''' usage of K meaning 1024 much less correlation.  So I think we are best served with a sentence that reads something like:

::The 15K example I gave was from a System/360 internal document.  It simply shows IBM adopted the K=1024 convention for the 360, with its large address space and quadrupling of addresses for the same physical memory. In any case, "became common in the 1970s" is problematical for several reasons. First, it suggests the usage wasn't common before then (which isn't true), second it needs qualification as to with whom it was common, certainly not the general public, and third, it is drawing a [[WP:OR]] conclusion from a few examples. I would not object to "The prefix “K” was used to denote 1024 by computer professionals in the late 1960s" or "Using the prefix “K” to denote 1024 was common among computer professionals '''by''' the early 1970s." --[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 17:30, 29 May 2011 (UTC)

I would point out that the qualification "among computer users" probably applies to the whole article with regard to customary binary prefixes.  I would also point out that while there is anecdotal evidence of some usage in the 60s and perhaps earlier, it really doesn't appear to be all that common.  It is a long reach from an appendix of an obscure Fortran manual to a common IBM corporate practice. So far I have found very few IBM usages of K until the late 70s.

For the past 30 some odd years the computer industry has been at odds as to what the "K" stood for.  Some represent it as 1000 time while others use 1024 to make their calculations.  As for a table, there is already a good table here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte so why create a new/different one which only confuses the issue.

No standard has come about in the past 30 years even though for the past 12 years or so, the computer world has tried to come up with a standard... they cannot agree on much.  Microsoft and many other disk manufacturers continue to use 1000 as the basis for K rather than the 1024 while others stick to the 1024 method.  The semiconductor industry has standardized on the 1024 use while disk mfgrs around the world continue to follow Microsoft's use of 1000 instead of 1024.  That's why when you format a disk per the 1000 scheme, you end up with some extra bits hanging around as unused space.

If somebody used 1000 back in the 1960's or 1970's, then mention that this is not consistent with the current 1024 usage, but then again, even though more and more people are using the 1024 in the computer world, some still cling to the 1000 as the converter.

It's been the same headache for over 30 years now and will probably continue to be for quite some time.  Thus debating it won't make it a standard any quicker.  Until everybody comes together with a single conversion method, there will continue to be variations and anomalies.  Denote them as such and leave older articles be.  At least Wikipedia should come to a single standard to use from now on and ensure that everybody follows that noting quote of older information need a footnote mentioning the differences.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wbenton|Wbenton]] ([[User talk:Wbenton|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wbenton|contribs]]) 06:43, 19 August 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: To Wbenton:
* ''Microsoft and many other disk manufacturers continue to use 1000 as the basis for K rather than the 1024 while others stick to the 1024 method. ''  Microsoft is not a disk manufacturer, but more important, MS's operating systems use K=1024, M=1,048,576, G=1,073,741,824, etc., in displays of disk size and file size as well as for RAM size. Disk manufacturers universally do use decimal prefixes; this is not a matter of "many other". 

* ''That's why when you format a disk per the 1000 scheme, you end up with some extra bits hanging around as unused space.'' Completely wrong, I'm afraid. You can't "format a disk per the 1000 scheme", whatever that means; the disks come in capacities that are multiples of either 512 or 4096 bytes - the sector size. When you put, for example, a 500 GB disk (500,000,000,000 bytes, that is 976,562,500 sectors of 512 bytes each) on a Windows machine, you get to use all 500,000,000,000 bytes. Really, you do. Oh, sure, the OS does report it as 465 GB, but because the G there means 1024<sup>3</sup>, that still equates to 500,000,000,000 bytes; there is no "unused space." (Check it. Multiply 465x1024x1024x1024. The discrepancy between the result and 500 billion is literally due to a rounding error.) If you look at the drive properties you will indeed see 500,000,000,000 bytes reported as the total size. And almost that much will be available, minus a tiny, tiny amount for partition structure and file system overhead (that will be nowhere near the 35GB "missing" from the 465GB figure).

I am sorry, but this still clears up 0 to me.
Using a certain Binary system goes back as far as the C=64. 1024 for one meg, 1024 Megs/1 Gig.
A proper Gig by this system would be 1,024,000 or 1,024,000,000 bytes. It would not amount to 500,000,000,000 bytes. You would end up at 512,000,000,000.
Also, windows doesn't allow you to use it all either.
Sometimes as much as 12 GB is used by windows for (??) Indexing?
I prefer the 1024 method, obviously. So where did the 1000 one over come from?

== Proposal to Split off "Disk drive performance characteristics" ==

<!-- fixed my own heading typo -->

I would like to propose that we split off the section on ''Performance characteristics'' for the following reasons:
# The current [[Hard disk drive]] article is already very long (too long based on other articles which have been split at this length).
# The existing articles for [[access time]] & [[seek time]] are vastly lacking sources and information.
# The article [[latency (engineering)]] is vastly lacking specific information on disk drives.
# Anyone reading any of these three articles should understand all three elements as a whole to lessen confusion. The single article would serve that purpose very <s>sell</s>well.

Once we have this section split off we can further expand it and properly source the material (which it is currently lacking on the specific descriptions and operations from my recent quick review. Any unique information in the access and seek time articles can be merged into this new one.

Then we can redirect the current articles on access time and seek time to this new article. The latency article can have a section on disk drives which points to the new article. The HDD article can then provide some basic information with an initial direct to the new article.

I propose we call the article '''Disk drive performance characteristics'''. Other proposals are certainly welcome.

I did not want to make any of these changes without consensus from the highly active editors in this article.

In the new article I will propose a slight modification to that content to put them as sub sections on latency since they result is slower spindle speeds. That might also help the flow a bit. I will likely focus those sections on the performance related aspects of those sections, so we will likely need to keep something on them here for the other contextual portions.

== Consider updates to (or splitting off) components section ==

I was reviewing sources for our new performance characteristics article and I ran across [http://www.storagereview.com/guide/index_op.html this article] and in [http://www.storagereview.com/guide/over_op.html this particular section]. It has a great logical flow for the inner workings of HDDs. I don't mean to say we should copy the article, but it was very helpful to see the list of key components listed with basic definitions. If we reorganized our components section (maybe bring it up one heading level) I think we could then create links to these component terms in Wikipedia to this section until someone decides it makes sense to write a whole article around some of the components. I will consider adding a more detailed component section, unless we think it should be its own article (which I am inclined to recommend anyway like we are doing for the performance characteristics section.

== "In machine-readable data storage..." ==

Referring to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&action=historysubmit&diff=466069477&oldid=466067283 this edit and comment], I think "machine-readable data storage" will be more puzzling to the hypothetical farmer from Africa than "hard disk drive" without a qualifier. It also struck me that the lede took a long time to get around to stating what a HDD is ''for.'' (My favorite uncivil editor is fond of ridiculing articles that never, or at least take a long time to, point out what the subject of the article is used for.) By adding "for storing and retrieving ..." to the end of the first sentence, we address both issues in a way much more quickly understood, not to mention far less awkward and stilted,  than "In machine-readable data storage...". 

Yes, there are uses for hard drives other than computers (consider the Ampex HS-100, which used a hard drive to  store ''analog'' signals, and with the head contacting the surface besides) but again, it's just the lede. It's enough to say "digital information, primarily computer data". Examples of other uses can appear later. We don't need to mention the occasional analog hard drive here either. It is not the purpose of the lede to describe every exception and special case. 

Speaking of which, I also removed some unnecessary detail (and a huge run-on sentence) from the lede. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 00:17, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

If so, I think I made it less technical by taking out MFM, GCR, etc and distinguishing between user data and the data as it is encoded onto the disk.  I thought about using Morse code as an analogy but thought that would be TMI.  My problems with the original version were the added tape analogy (IMO not a good one), the several obsolete codes that are just a form of RLL, the way recording was described (sequential changes in polarity versus transitions) and the lack of distinction between encoding and decoding, all of which I tried to fix.

:#Modes of failure
:#Historical examples
:#Recovery from failures

The stuff on head load/unload and landing zones would be moved to section 2.

: IMO it is not possible for the DRAM to cause any failure of an HDD, period, much less causing it to "burn".  Since the system now works with the same 4 GiB of RAM, the same power supply, the same cables and a new drive from the same manufacturer it sounds like just plain bad luck.  The cable connections are the only thing that really changed as the drives changed and it is hard to see how they could cause a drive to "burn" - for example, I doubt if an intermittent power supply ground pin or wire would cause a drive to "burn". Likewise the drives are pretty robust so an intermittent power supply is liable to do a lot more damage to other electronics long before it "burns" the drive  I vote for bad luck.

== Hard disk drive "too technical"? ==

[[Special:Contributions/173.180.88.123|173.180.88.123]] ([[User talk:173.180.88.123|talk]]) 23:40, 31 December 2011 (UTC)I would like to comment on the heading that states:

"This article may be too technical for most readers to understand.  Please help improve this article to make it understandable to non-experts, without removing the technical details.  The talk page may contain suggestions.  (October 2011)"

This is a technical article, and is therefore "technical".  As politically incorrect as it may be, there are many topics that when properly presented, will be beyond the scope of understanding for many readers.  I found it quite interesting, there are numerous links, and if I don't understand something, I'll just have to look it up.

All disciplines of study have their own language or terminology that have a specific meaning for the discipline, but a very different meaning to those who have not been educated in the discipline.  Replacing this specific terminology or language with simpler language so it becomes more "understandable" will only create ambiguity, and confusion for those who do understand the terminology.

There are no short cuts to learning or understanding.

I do not consider myself a "techie" or "geek", but the vast majority of computer users have very little knowledge about their systems.  Some of my friends consider me an "expert", but compared to the real experts I have known over the years, I am not much more than a "newbie".

One of the best examples of misunderstood terminology can be drawn from statistics; accuracy and precision have very different meanings, but they are used interchangeably in common usage.

Trying to “dumb down” information or knowledge to the lowest common denominator leads to mediocrity, and is a disservice to those who have taken considerable time, often at considerable expense, to acquire their expertise.

Wikipedia should also be a source of information for those of us who willing to stretch our minds to acquire more knowledge.

Pablum is not the solution.

== Failure modes and drive orientation ==

[[user:Johnnynolan2|User Johnnynolan2]] ([[Special:Contributions/Johnnynolan2|contribs]], [[User talk:Johnnynolan2|talk]]) added a claim that vertically orienting a hard drive could contribute to failure. I have reverted this for these reasons:

* All Wikipedia content must be verifiable by being referenced to reliable sources. There was a source, but it's a self-published blog; those don't count. 
* The claim is contradicted by information from hard drive manufacturers. They do recommend that the platters be within a few degrees of horizontal or vertical, but there is no recommendation against vertical. 
* The claim on the referenced blog is unlikely in that it depends on the access arms simply moving in and out (like a piston). Rather, the arm assembly rotates around a pivot, in the manner of the tone arm on a record turntable. And, like a turntable arm, it is counterweighted on the other side of the pivot. Due to the counterweight, a vertical orientation does not cause gravity to pull the arms in or out. (Hey, the manufacturers did anticipate the possibility of vertical orientation!)
* The exact arm position is determined by the drive reading signal from the tracks and micro-positioning the heads for the best signal. The drives do not simply command the heads to move to a position and hope for the best. They used to do that (a couple of decades ago, using stepper motors) but no more. So even if gravity did exert an influence on the head position, it would be corrected by the drive. 

I hope this adequately explains why I reverted these edits. Further discussion here, please, if anyone wants. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 06:05, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

: I've seen some pretty convincing diagrams that imply vertical mounting can significantly raise the number of seek errors (which would reduce performance, but not cause failure), but I don't think those were published on a reputable tech site. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 16:53, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

: I agree with Jeh's analysis and support the removal.  In modern HDDs the rotary actuators are balanced and the closed loop positioning mechanism can easily compensate for any residual force caused by any residual unbalance.  I doubt if vertical mounting has any effect upon seek errors in modern drives.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 17:54, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

: I found an interesting forum thread [http://silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=21533]. According to manufacturers any the 6 orientations is fine although they usually make no comment on tilted ones or say not to mount them tilted (Hitachi). The thread itself is of course not a reliable source, but some of the sources they bases their conclusions on are. We should probably add something on this to the article. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 18:59, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

:: I suppose a single sentence someplace in the article that modern disk drives can be mounted in any orientation citing the references in the  [http://silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=21533 thread] would be OK although I am not sure it adds much to this already overlong article.  Regarding tilt - ever seen a prohibition on operating your laptop on your lap?  FWIW, I'm typing this on an IBM T23 in an IBM docking station with a designed in tilt measured at about 3 degrees; this laptop came with and IBM now HGST soon to be WD HDD, so I suspect HGST's prohibition is not substantive :-).  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 20:04, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

::: Vertical and stranger orientations are quite common in servers, consumer electronics and external drives, so yes I completely agree there not going to be a problem with this. Still, orientation could perhaps affect temperature distribution, (platter) vibration and bearing load (all probably more in 3.5" drives than in 2.5" drives), so I wouldn't be surprised if this resulted in some empirically measurable performances differences from the drives having a harder time locking onto a track. But without any reliable sources confirming this, it shouldn't go into the article. Perhaps we should add a short section on "Mounting" and summarize manufacturer recommendations, discuss some industry practices, vibration in storage arrays (enterprise drives compensate for this) and perhaps a historical note on stepper drives? It surely is a point that seems to be discussed quite often. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 20:42, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

::::I suppose a single subsection with a single short sentence in section 5, Performance, would be more than enough.  FWIW, IMO orientation would not substantively change temperature distribution, (platter) vibration and/or bearing load sufficient to cause any measurable change in seek performance or HDD reliability.  Of the three it is true that orienting the long access of the drive with the air flow could produce a lower temperature rise but the difference in rise is small and at least some empirical studies have not shown any correlation between temperature rise and reliability.  Since gravity is reasonably consistent even stepper motor drives were relatively immune to orientation so long as you didn't change the orientation after formatting.  Open loop linear actuator drives (stepper and voice coil) couldn't be vertically mounted but most of them were so big they couldn't be so oriented.  An interesting historical footnote, IMO, not worthy of mention. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:54, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

::::::: I think a lede that would be "long enough" to satisfy that rather arbitrary guideline would be as long as a short WP article all by itself. 
::::::: Perhaps part of the answer is to split the article. I'm thinking of the average WP reader who comes here looking for information on current or recent hard drives. They're probably not much interested in the IBM 350 RAMAC, eight-inch form factor drives, or how we used to choose the optimum interleave factor, or in the changes from ST506 to ESDI interfaces. They are probably not even interested in polycrystalline recording material. Heck, the article uses the floppy disc drive form factor as a point of comparison and most computers have not come with floppy drives for almost ten years now. I'd suggest splitting off a lot of the historical and current, but deep, technical information into a "Hard disk drive history and technology" article and leave this one to describe the functional characteristics of modern and very recent devices. I'd think the typical reader could then find their desired info much more quickly here. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 00:41, 3 October 2012 (UTC)

As for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&diff=515946450&oldid=515777323 the most recent edit] making the lead shorter, that only serves to illustrate that you don't understand what WP:LEAD is trying to put across: it is not a matter of raw character, word or paragraph count, but of coverage.

::::: I guess I'm just disappointed by having to repeatedly face gainsaying like "this is a Goldilocks lede" which puts subjective opinion over discussion. But let's look at exactly what I'd like changed:
:::::1. The alterations to the introcution of adjectives in the first and second paragraphs should be undone. This is a classic error in writing lead sections: the insistence in cramming every possible adjective into the first sentence. Links should not be bunched-up next to each other, and long strings of comma-separated adjectives are awkward in any case.
::::::*We disagree, I did take out digital as a concession.  Right now there are only two commas so I don't think yr description is at all accurate. The problem I have with yr original construction is yr two sentences relate to the same material but are in two paragraphs and somewhat redundant.  Not appropriate for a lede IMO [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 16:18, 10 October 2012 (UTC)
:::::2. Mention of data loss should be restored, as data integrity is a top-level section in the article body.
::::::*Head crash is by most accounts one of the lesser causes of data loss in HDDs so highlighting it in the lede is not at all a summary.

:::::3. The contrast between binary and decimal multipliers should be restored. We devote a considerable portion of the relevant section in the body to that distinction.
::::::*But it is only one of the several causes of the reason why the reported capacity is always less than the specified capacity.  The Binary Prefix wars still being waged at Wikipedia is the only reason we devote so much to it in this article.  The current sentence summarizes all of the factors into "system usage and reporting."   If you don't like that phrase why not come up with a better summary phrase instead of bring the entire section into the lede? 
:::::4. I'm not sure it's accurate to describe server hardware as using 3.5" disks. If we're going to highlight server disks, it should be to point out that they use FC / SCSI / SAS and are predominantly hotpluggable rather than to focus on the form factor (which varies considerably). This needs expanded in the body as well, to be fair.
::::::*That's not what it says, all it says is desktops and servers '''typically''' user 3.5" form factors which is generally true although some do use 2.5" form factors.

# "Only two commas" is hardly an excuse. No article should ever have four juxtaposed adjectives, all linked, in its lead sentence. It is, as I say, a very common error in writing articles here whereby editors believe that it is absolutely necessary to summarise the entire article in its first sentence. It is not. To pick a random example, [[Barack Obama]]'s initial sentence says little more than that he is the current POTUS. You could cram a dozen very important adjectives into that sentence, but it wouldn't improve it.
# On further investigation, you're right that data loss is not given so much coverage in the article body that it needs included in the lead. Happy with that removal.
# I think that the previous summary, "Not all of the disk may be available for storage, as the system may contain inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery and the file system used will reserve some disk space for its own use", was concise enough for the lead and yet not as mushy as "However, due to system usage and reporting not all of the specified storage is ever available for user storage". For the binary prefix thing, the fact of the matter is that we devote considerable space to it in the article body and so it belongs in the lead. One solution may be simply cutting down on how much time we give it in the body.
# I think "obsolescent" is a rather strong way of putting it. PCs are no longer sold with PATA drives, but "obsolescent" implies a rather stronger deprecation. The vast majority of present hardware still uses these technologies, which isn't the case for the likes of ST412. The point here, though, is that server hardware shares little in common with desktop hardware, and the phrasing used somewhat implied that servers used basically the same disks as desktop machines (which they don't).

4. I don't feel so strongly about PATA and FC, but I would have u note:

::I think that after 4 years with little market share PATA is obsolescent and is approaching obsolete (one of the reasons I finally gave up my IBM T23 laptop is I couldn't get a big enough 2½-inch PATA upgrade, having started with 60 GB and going thru several upgrades to the maximum at 250 GB).  FC is probably a year or two behind.  Since this is the lede I don't think we should waste the space on these interfaces.  I'm not sure what in the phrasing implies "servers used basically the same disks as desktop machines" - they do share the same form factor and as the statistic above indicates there are a lot of SATA drives in the server market today.  Perhaps a sentence in the lede summarizing the [[Hard_disk_drive#Market_segments|market segmentation]] (Section 9), although to be honest I really don't like adding to the lede?

::1. Even thought I don't agree it is necessary, I have made the change I proposed above.  Now it has three nouns strung together ?-:
::2. 
::3. Actually the current construction is more accurate and not at all mushy since it includes all sources of loss of storage in words that are understandable to all using their common dictionary meaning.  The proposed construct is wordy and only addresses two of the several, but if you insist on this construct here is a less wordy version of your proposed language:
:::"However not all of the specified storage is available to the user due to amongst other things, file system usage, how the system reports capacity and possible redundant usage for error recovery."
:::I really think this adds nothing but a lot of words that are accurately covered by "system usage and reporting."  You have characterized this as "mushy" - I don't think it is mushy at all:
::::'''system usage''' covers hidden partitions, RAID, file system and any other usage by the system
::::'''and [system] reporting''' covers binary reporting, truncation, and any other reporting difference by the system
:::so I would really appreciate what you find mushy about this simple and accurate construction.
::4. I haven't seen any statistics but I would bet given the retirement rate of old computers PATA is no longer a large share of the market.  And of course FC was hardly measurable. I agree that the lede should not be aimed at bleeding edge western consumers and I don't get your point that leaving out PATA and FC somehow makes it so.  I thought the lede was for the general audience in which case even SAS would be in appropriate.  Be that as it may, if you want to add PATA and FC to the list go ahead.  I won't even argue about long lists of nouns being inappropriate

::[[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 16:40, 12 October 2012 (UTC)

The new lede is poorly written. The purpose of a lede, to my mind, is to give enough context that the user can navigate the rest of the article. If a given fact is so detailed that it provides no additional context outside of itself, it shouldn't be in the lede. A few specific critiques:
* Too many vague descriptors (e.g., "thin layer," "tiny gaps," "rapidly rotating")
* Nonsensical and tangential discussion of capacity (If units of 1000, why 1024? Why care?)
* Performance section provides metrics with no context. Why would a reader care about this? What's important is to get a feel for where HDDs stand in the hierarchy of storage caching. 
* Size section presumes a knowledge of 'form factors'. What's 2.5"? The width axis?  
* Why are revenues listed instead of units shipped or market penetration? Given the massive price increases earlier this year, high revenue figures probably present an erroneous picture of growth. 
That's all in addition to grammatical and phrasing errors. (e.g., last sentence of first paragraph: cost per unit of reliability?) The previous lede, however brief, was better than this one.
Here's how I would set it up:
* General classification and purpose
* Speed and capacity in caching hierarchy; reference SSDs and RAM for context; three relevant metrics: capacity, random access speed, sustained throughput
* Physical size and weight
* Power use, also as compared to SSDs; relevant metrics: idle vs. active seek
* Reliability, including HDD-specific weaknesses (e.g., impacts)  
* Market penetration and trends
History, interfaces, and a detailed discussion of the mechanics of operation are better left to the main article.

== SSD replacing HDD? ==

This is certainly POV since most neutral observers state that SSDs are not likely to replace HDDs in general purpose computer systems in the foreseeable future.  Furthermore, the cites really don't support the assertion that SSD are more reliable.  Finally, since there is no such discussion of SSDs replacing HDDs in the body of the article, it is inappropriate in the lede.  So if you want to put something into the body, that's great, but even then I would argue that it is not sufficiently important at this time to add it to the lede.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 16:23, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

:Who are these "neutral observers"? *All* the tech magazines and web sites are talking about SSDs replacing Hard Disks. How can it be POV if it has 3 references? The problem in the lead is that it says HDDs have maintained their dominant position (against what??) when in fact SSDs are way faster and possibly more reliable. HDD vs SSD is one of the biggest stories in computing at the moment. Why ignore it? [[User:Bhny|Bhny]] ([[User talk:Bhny|talk]]) 16:34, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

:Maybe you didn't read my references. They are all recent and all talk about how SSDs are faster, more "resilient" and are replacing HDDs in desktops and servers. Obviously hdds have lost out to solid state in laptops and other mobile devices but for some reason you think a laptop isn't a general computing device. [[User:Bhny|Bhny]] ([[User talk:Bhny|talk]]) 17:42, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

:Again who is this neutral observer? [[User:Bhny|Bhny]] ([[User talk:Bhny|talk]]) 17:43, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

::Anecdotes are not evidence of change in a dominant market position nor is it obvious that SSDs have made a substantial inroad into the laptop market.  Yes laptops are in the gp market segment and a few are sold with SSDs but way more than the majority of laptops are sold with HDDs, see, e.g. [http://www.zdnet.com/hard-drives-still-dominate-ssds-in-laptop-market-report-7000001313/ "Hard drives still dominate SSDs in laptop market"].  And the penetration of the mainframe, server and desktop market segments is miniscule.  
::The neutral observers are the independent market analysts like IDC, Gartner, Needham, iSuppli, etc for both current market sizing and projections to the future; none of them have HDDs loosing dominance in the foreseeable future. The bottom line is that SSDs will not close the price/terabyte gap of HDDs in the foreseeable future and therefore will be limited to early adopters.
::The reason the gap won't close is that both are now proceeding down similar areal density learning curves.  Flash had an advantage early in this century because it piggy backed on Moore's law (then driven by DRAM) but now it is the bleeding edge so it won't accelerate.  U must know that the semiconductor folks are projecting Moore's law is slowing down. Furthermore, the demand in hand held device market is so large that there is right now, little incentive for the Flash manufacturers to lower their chip price to close the gap
::The analogy I would give you is hybrid versus conventional engine cars - better mileage, lower maintenance, faster off the line, but not likely to dominate the market until when and if the cost gets close. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 19:40, 9 October 2012 (UTC)

::You might take a look at [http://www.isuppli.com/Abstract/P23628_20120911150636.pdf iSuppli SSD & HDD Market Tracker] which shows an 8% current market share on a unit basis for SSDs.  The share is projected to grow to about 22% by 2015 but the unit growth is almost the same for both products.  Sort of like when Russia was outgrowing the US and u know how that turned out.  Even if the relative share growth does occur, HDDs with 78% market share could be reasonably called dominant even then.  If you measure share on a storage basis HDD is even more dominant.  I don't dispute that in some applications some HDDs are being replaced by SSDs but there is simply no evidence that HDD dominance of the market is going to be challenged in the foreseeable future.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 00:00, 10 October 2012 (UTC)

::: I would also suggest that while the SSD does have a foot in the door (but only that) as the primary drive in a PC, when people add more storage it's almost always in HDDs. For the home market, look at the large number of models of external HDs. And in large server storage, hard drives are even less challenged.

== Dubious ==

Image caption tagged dubious because the image *itself* has been tagged. (Note that I only recently placed a tag on the SVG image, but as it was originally just a vectorised version of a bitmap image- i.e. based on the same data- and *that* had been tagged since 2009, the issues remain).

See [[:File:Hard drive capacity over time.png]] (the original) and [[:File:Hard drive capacity over time.svg]] (vectorised version, was later updated, but only for new data, existing data still has same problems).

::So, your concern is, as you write at the image's page: '''at least in the 1980s misses the higher capacity drives which generally were not offered at retail'''<br />
::So what? "not offered at retail" means they were not on sale.

:::Perhaps I should have said, '''not advertised at retail.''' High capacity disk drives were for sale and in the early 1980s were 70% or so of the market as measured by revenue.  High capacity drives were not advertised for sale thru retail channels such as stores and advertisements in magazines (e.g. Byte).  The high capacity disk drives were generally sold by the direct sales forces of computer manufactures (e.g., IBM, CDC, DEC, etc.,) and/or their resellers (e.g. Systems Industries).  IBMs prices were published and rarely discounted but the others were frequently discounted so calculating an average price is difficult.  The higher capacity market segment was by far the largest market segment by revenue for most of the 1980s making this graph of retail drive prices pretty much meaningless for at least the first half of the 1980s.

== Capacity Fudge ==

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&curid=13777&diff=520876133&oldid=520646752 fudge] is not necessary.  There is ample evidence on the web that the capacity reported by the system is '''always''' less than that advertised by the manufacturer for at least one of the reasons selected.  Google "Hard Drive Capacity Always Less Than Stated" and read the several reliable sources identified.  The problem is that there is no one concise source that lists all of the factors the way we do in this article.  I am not aware of any evidence to support a ''may be'' fudge and so am reverting the change. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 19:45, 1 November 2012 (UTC)
== Platters column in Form Factor ==

The Platters column in [[Hard_disk_drive#Form_factors|Form Factors]] always causes confusion since it is not always the highest capacity drive that has the maximum number of platters per drive and historically there may have been earlier models with many more platters than the current highest capacity HDD.  For example, today in 3½-inch the highest density is about 1 TB/platter but there are many 5 platter drives currently around at less than or equal to the current maximum 4 TB/drive.  Historically, I think there have been as many as 10 platters in a 1.63 inch high 3½-inch FF.  WD (HGST) has just announced a helium filled drive for next year that will allow 7 platters in a 25.4 mm high 3½-inch FF.  I think we should just eliminate the column as TMI and confusing at that.  Perhaps include it as text in the details on the FF in the section. Any better suggestions?  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 18:15, 15 November 2012 (UTC)

:I'm also concerned with the title of the table. It appears to be PC based and to only cover recent drives. Older drives such as the [[IBM 355]] and the [[IBM 1301]] had far more platters than anything in the table, as did disks from other vendors in the first third of the 20th century. [[User:Chatul|Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul]] ([[User talk:Chatul|talk]]) 20:50, 20 November 2012 (UTC)

::The term '''form factor''' generally has not been used to cover 24-inch and 14-inch disk drives although I suppose one might consider some 14-inch drives to be in an ASME rack form factor - so I don't have any real problem with the table title.  The section does cover the shapes of the early drives you mention (washing machine or rack).  Adding more about these historical drives would IMO be TMI.  The term form factor didn't come into general usage until the early 1980s when first the SA1000 HDD was the same form factor as the FH 8-inch FDD.  This also is covered in the section.  The form factors listed are not in any way limited to PC since enterprise HDDs comport to the listed form factors.  I'm not sure what you are proposing, expand the chart to include the early models - I would oppose that as TMI.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 23:23, 20 November 2012 (UTC)
== Unknown answer while reading the article ==

I have question about hard drives and I didn't find the answer in both French and English version of the article.
I am wondering about the technical reason that prevent hard drives to have two or more heads stacks as shown by this example:
[[File:Bras de disque dur.svg|left|thumbnail|Please open this image as svg in a separate viewer to get a correct preview (wikipedia doesn't show the picture correctly) (I tested it when I entrer the full url of the svg file in opera)]]{{-}}
In this case it could increase random access possibilities, and thus increase the speed at the expanse of less capacity.
A typical usage would be fetching data over a fragmented partition or copy a file to an another place on the disk.
It could also be a security in a case a head stack got a failure without damaging any platter.

But it is not possible because it is so much evident.
I couldn't find the answer anywhere.English Wikipedia could give more technical details about hard disk so it would be useful.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ytrezq|Ytrezq]] ([[User talk:Ytrezq|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ytrezq|contribs]]) 18:02, 3 February 2013 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:There is no technical reason to not have multiple head stacks for one set of disks and there have been a number of such drives over time starting with variants on the original RAMAC which I seem to recall had provision for up to 8 head stacks and shipped at least one variant with two or perhaps even four head stacks.  Making the head stacks read the same tracks is a challenge, there have been many drives with two head stacks on one set of disks, e.g. the IBM 3380, but the last drive I know of that could read the same track with heads from two head stacks was a Conner product circa 1990 which had only limited production.   The market seems to have decided this doesn't make economic sense. On the whole, I think this is not notable so it shouldn't be in Wikipedia.

== HDD  projected to remain more popular "for the foreseeable future" ==

The reference for this is from someone at Western Digital. This is like someone at Kodak talking about how film will never replace digital. I've balanced this dubious opinion with a reference to a Time.com tech article.  It is POV pushing to only have one side on this. Someone strangely reverted my addition. I've put it back and corrected a link error. [[User:Bhny|Bhny]] ([[User talk:Bhny|talk]]) 00:30, 25 November 2012 (UTC)

:I reverted and again will revert your edit since the cited reference (URL now corrected) does not support your [[POV]] statement that "though cloud storage could make HDDs obsolete for the PC."  The reference notes cloud storage has not been successful in music and most consumers "appear to be happier buying songs outright from Apple and being responsible for storing them on local disks. And hard drives have gotten so cheap that there’s no economic reason not to have one or more humongous ones."  Hardly a forecast of cloud storage obsoleting HDDs on the PC.  

:While the reference is authored by WD, Forbes is a reliable source and there are plenty of other reliable sources including those in the Flash and SSD industry that have made the same forecast; e.g. [http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/86/86495/2008_Flash_Memory.pdf Eli Harai CEO SanDisk] or [http://thessdguy.com/for-the-lack-of-a-fab/#more-538 The SSD Guy]. It is possible at some time in the unforeseeable future that HDDs would be obsoleted by some other technology, possibly even Flash, but at this point it is pure speculation and inappropriate in an article, much less in the lede.

To a certain extent I feel like we are in the midst of the argument between Nate Silver and the talking heads over the 2012 election.  On one side we have executives of major companies on both sides of the technologies and based in their analyses saying SSDs will NOT replace  HDDs in the foreseeable future and on the other side we have columnists enthralled by the speed of HDDs saying it may happen because that's what their gut tells them.  If you carefully read the four cites by Bhny, none of them say it ''will'' happen; the best says:
{{quote|"It's '''unclear whether SSDs will totally replace traditional spinning hard drives''', especially with shared cloud storage waiting in the wings. The price of SSDs is coming down, but still not enough to totally replace the TB of data that some users have in their PCs and Macs. Cloud storage isn't free either: you'll continue to pay as long as you want personal storage on the Internet. Home NAS drives and cloud storage on the Internet will alleviate some storage concerns, but '''local storage won't go away until we have ubiquitous wireless Internet everywhere,''' including planes and out in the wilderness. '''Of course, by that time, there may be something better.''' I can't wait."  ['''emphasis added''']
|sign=[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404262,00.asp SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference?]
}}
And even if local storage goes away, the stored information won't and where would it be in such a scenario, on HDDs in the cloud.  Two of the cites are just articles by editors sharing their experiences and not predictive.  The forth cite, discussed above, merely raises an unanswered question.  While I think we make a mistake here by giving equal weight to reliable sources on one hand and POV on the other hand, in the interest of coming to a consensus I rewrote the sentence to balance the citations and distinguish between the two perspectives therein.

===Edit war prevention :-) ===
I just had a "near" vs "foreseeable" (future) single-round flip-flop with Tom94022.  I didn't want to get anybody's back up by summarily undoing the undo.  It was just easier to flop back the flip.  "Near" is better though.  We don't need to quote refs verbatim, we are allowed to improve on their words.  The thing about "forseeable" is that all it takes is one "existence proof" to invalidate.  That is, if one person can "foresee" a future, ''however far out'', where SSDs are superior in every way (including costs) for either medium ''or'' secondary, then that future IS foreseeable.  It's a hair-splitting technicality I know, but "near" ''is'' clearer for the encyclopedic form that we are writing.  "Foreseeable" is okay for a magazine form and for a writer under a deadline.  But, we have the time to improve on it and a mandate to write in a different way.[[Special:Contributions/108.7.163.236|108.7.163.236]] ([[User talk:108.7.163.236|talk]]) 19:57, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

== Disks replacing tape ==

Magnetic tape was the dominant secondary store through most of the 1960s, and into the 70s. Early disks were expensive and had nowhere near the capacity needed for most business applications. Most data processing was batch, not real time, and tape densities kept improving from 200 bytes per inch to 6250 bpi, the latter allowing up to 180 megabytes on a single 2400 foot reel of tape. I don't think a 2004 Toshiba press release is a reliable source to the contrary.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 11:48, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

::"Introduced by [[IBM]] in 1956, HDDs have been the dominant [[secondary storage]] device in [[history of general purpose CPUs|general purpose computers]] since the early 1960s.  They have maintained this position thru continuous improvements at a rate not unlike [[Moore's Law]]. More than 200 companies ..."
FWIW, the sentance on home computing is redundant since gp computing includes home computing so I think it can be stricken.  I ask because Thumperwald seems to have a strong ownership of his specific edits so I hesitate to make any change without getting agreement from at least one other editor.

== Average Access Time ==

I do not know for sure what "Average access time" means, but I know for sure our coverage is unreliable. We currently have:

:An HDD's ''Average Access Time'' is its average [[Seek time]] which technically is the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.

However, we also have on [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics]]:

:The access time or response time of a rotating drive is a measure of the time it takes before the drive can actually transfer data. The factors that control this time on a rotating drive are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads.

And later in this article:

:[[Access time]] can be improved by increasing rotational speed (thus reducing latency) and/or by reducing the time spent seeking.

It is clear that ''access time'' is not merely seek time; it includes latency. Therefore, either ''Average Access Time'' means something other than the average of access times - which is highly dubious - or our definition of ''Average Access Time'' is wrong. However, we do have a non-insignificant source giving this definition:

:The average time a drive requires to perform a seek operation, usually measured by one-third stroke.

I propose that Western Digital got that definition wrong. Note that this is not from a page specifically covering average access time, but from a glossary. I easily found 2 articles contradicting WD:

:Average Access Time: The average time it takes for a disk drive to begin reading data placed anywhere on the drive. This includes seek time and latency.[http://www.superglossary.com/Definition/Computers/Average_Access_Time.html]

:An average access time of 8.0 ms (including seek time and rotational latency) [...] [http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd1500ad-raptor-xtends-performance-lead,1215-9.html]

Unless we can find more sources supporting WD's definition, we should fix our definition. Note that the lead refers to average access time. --[[User:Chealer|Chealer]] ([[User talk:Chealer|talk]]) 23:38, 4 January 2013 (UTC)
:The WD definition is historically wrong; average access time as published by most if not all disk drive manufacturers would better be called average seek time.  Unfortunately ''access time'' as a term of computer art,as in RAM, means the time to the start of the data transfer which in disk drive terms is seek time plus time to rotate the disk to the data which on the average is average access (seek) time plus latency.  That is, in the disk drive world '''average access time means something other than average of''' ''access times'''''!'''  Thus I think the article is correct as written.  Since this is an HDD article we should use the industry definitions and maybe clarify the distinction over the computer industry term ''access time'' in a footnote.

{{od}}Actually I am not sure what u are disputing since the referenced WD dictionary page separately defines ''access time'' and ''average access times'' as two different things consistent with our article.

:I am not disputing a specific sentence, as I do not know what Average Access Time means for sure.

::The page is correct, '''Average Access Time''' (initial caps) is a term of the disk drive industry art which is not the average of all access times as the term ''access time'' is used in computer art.

:::We don't have to use industry's jargon to designate its products. Whichever term is best should be our choice. Anyway, avoiding "access time" is neither desirable nor feasible.

::::While I consider myself an expert in the art, any expert's opinion is not necessarily relevant; what is relevant is that there are many reliable sources that confirm that in the disk drive industry '''Average Access Time''' is '''NOT''' the average of all access times, but rather the average of all seek times.  It is a published term of the art, not jargon, and belongs in the article because that is the term the user will encounter if he/she should read any specification published for any disk drive, hard or otherwise.  FWIW it turned out to be relatively easy to purge ''access time'' so as to avoid confusion.  It might be worth adding a footnote that '''Average Access Time''' is '''NOT''' the average of all access times, but that is somewhat covered in Section 5.1. so it might be TMI.

:::::While there may be many reliable sources supporting the problematic meaning, this article refers to a single one. And we have the opinion of a single presumed expert. Which is why I'd like at least the opinion of another expert. "Access time" may have been "purged" in a sense, but it remains in other articles, and even in this article as part of "average access time". If the situation is what it seems to be, a footnote is insufficient, the terminology must be explained in the body. I do not see what you say in section 5.1. I simply see the definition which conflicts with the definition of "access time", but I consider the contradiction as the problem, not as the solution. --[[User:Chealer|Chealer]] ([[User talk:Chealer|talk]]) 16:06, 23 March 2013 (UTC)

== material stores the bits ==

What material stores the bits?
This article vaguely mentions a "magnetic material" and more specifically says it is a "ferromagnetic material".
I suppose in theory any magnetic material could in principle be used to store bits.
But is there one specific material that is actually used in practice?
Or do many hard drives use one material, and many other hard drives use some other material?

:Great question.  Initially the magnetic layer was gamma iron oxide particles in an epoxy base.

== Silent Data Corruption ==

It is true that HDDs have a hard error rate but dealing with it is beyond the HDD and therefore beyond the scope of this article so I suggest the section [[Hard_disk_drive#Silent_data_corruption|Silent Data Corruption]] is not particularly relevant to this HDD article and should be incorporated in the [[RAID]] article or elsewhere.  The hard error rate is already covered in the prior section [[Hard_disk_drive#Error_rates_and_handling|Error rates and handling]] so I removed the section leaving the text there for someone to incorporate into RAID or elsewhere.  All that is needed in this article is a See Also or link to where ever Silent Data Corruption winds up.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 23:32, 1 January 2014 (UTC)

It is not for Wikipedia to say that anything is "evident" (though we can quote a RS that says so), nor to declare that one thing or another is "one solution to his problem".

Why don't u take a try at adding RS material to the existing paragraph, his [http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1866298 ACM article] seems like a good place to start, but again, IMO most of it belongs in the RAID article not here.

== External portable drives?  What about "external desktop drives"? ==
The section on "External removable drives" was renamed to "External portable drives", but I'm not sure how portable all the drives that attach via hot-pluggable connections are.

: Hello there!  I agree that both old and this new section title aren't perfect...  Though, naming it "External desktop drives" would be slightly worse, as that way we'd be ruling out external laptop drives while they're covered in the section; that's probably that manufacturers are trying to accomplish by separating external HDDs into those two categories (3.5-inch vs. 2.5-inch external HDDs).  Personally, calling something "external desktop drive", and something else "external laptop drive" (or "external portable drive") is pretty much plain PR talk to me, as that would mean external 3.5-inch HDDs aren't portable; sure, they are ''less easily'' portable, but they still are very portable. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]) 21:25, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

::I split the difference and renamed it to "External desktop and portable drives".
::I think "portable", in manufacturer-speak, means "you can carry this drive fairly conveniently" (e.g., "tucks into a laptop bag", as is the case for the current backup drives for our household), and "desktop" means "you could carry this drive, but it's a bit of a pain (so that it won't tuck into a laptop bag without pain, as was the case for our older backup drives).  Our "desktop" backup drives also included power supplies and wall-warts; our "portable" backup drives get their power from the USB connection.  So I think the distinction isn't just PR talk; there really ''are'' differences in how the drives are used (at least in our experience - we take the "portable" backup drives along with us and do backups when away from home, whereas we didn't bother doing so with the "desktop" backup drives.
::I don't know how the manufacturers intend "desktop" to be interpreted, but I view it as referring to the drive, not to the machine into which the drive was plugged; you can plug "desktop" external drives into a laptop (our computers are both laptops, so that's what we were doing with the old "desktop" backup drives), but they're more likely to be sitting on a desktop than carried with you.

::: Well, back at the time (not so long ago) I was extremely happy to have an external USB&nbsp;2.0/Firewire enclosure holding a 3.5-inch 80&nbsp;GB HDD, and I considered it to be ''super'' portable. :)  I agree that portable vs. desktop distinction makes sense, but that's still primarily the way for manufacturers to name their product lines and make choosing them easier for Joe Averages.  To me, it would be more important to know whether is it a 5,400 or 7,200&nbsp;rpm HDD inside the enclosure, and how much cache it has (what isn't published, as Joe Averages have no clues about those numbers), than to have those two obvious form factor&ndash;based product categories. :)
::: What about enclosures holding two HDDs, exposing them via eSATA or USB (no Ethernet, so they're not NASes), while doing some kind of RAID or JBOD?  Should those be categorized as "external enterprise drives"?  They're still portable, fit on a desktop, and can be connected to laptop and desktop computers. :)

Though, most of them are (again) more of a kind of external backplanes, as majority of the control logic is within the servers.

Alternatively, the number could be derived from knowledge of the drive's geometry (zones, tracks per zone, sectors per track) but that is also no longer published.  BTW, there is an interesting paper out of Korea on a software program that can be used to determine the geometry of an HDD; I don't think anyone ever used it to determine the number of spare sectors.

::Are you showing 1.0 TB per consumer grade (minimum cost per bit) disk in stores (not just on paper) at start-of-2013, using an assumed 20% CAGR? That implies mid-2014 would have 1.3 TB / consumer grade disk, and mid-2016 would have 1.9 TB / consumer grade disk. But rather than 1.3 TB, I still see 1.0 TB per consumer grade disk in stores now. So from where I sit, density CAGR has been 0% since early 2013.<p>The 1.9 TB / consumer grade disk scenario in mid-2016 would require, starting from the actual density observed now in mid-2014 of 1.0 TB / consumer grade disk, (1.9 / 1.0) ^ (1 / 2 years) -1 = 40% per year growth rate from here on out. This is not likely.<p>So my confidence in consumer grade CAGR even reaching as high as 20% per year would be reduced if areal density at the consumer level is stagnant. It could be less than 20% per year now.[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 03:41, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
:::The Seagate Barracuda 7200.15 at 4TB was commercially available in early 2013 - do your own research to figure out what was its date and if it was first.  AD advance is not continuous, it a discrete series moving in discrete steps, which are fewer now that there are only three companies.  There is no growth until the next new product announcement - this is NOT zero or "stagnant" grown, just no data.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 05:31, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
::::No density data, but the price data are indicative and supportive.

Consumer grade density has not changed in the last 18 months, because suppliers can't change areal density on their manufacturing lines daily as they can on prices at retail. Even so, the areal density growth forecast of <20% per year ''is'' in the same ballpark as the approximately 20% price improvement observed over the past 12 months.[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 20:51, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::Another goalpost change?  The section talks about bytes/3.5-in disk which is directly related to AD - cost/bit is something else and it is not uncommon for the first product at a new AD to be announced at a high price/bit and then price decreases as yields and volumes improve.  At the MSST2014 conference today a Seagate representative stated that a new higher density desktop type product will be announced this year using shingled write - a 6 TB drive on 4 disks would be right in line with 20%/year from early 2013 and two years before your prediction.

::::::Did the original article text, forecasting 12 TB in 2016, not need any references, or was that original research? The previous forecast (based on 40% CAGR) has no references, so I was slow to add references when I updated it. <p>The 20% forecast isn't mine. The references for the <20% forecast are as follows: a Stanford university data storage researcher and other researchers (most not on the industry payroll) published at an UNESCO conference; an industry roadmap quoted by an industry analyst, and a senior Seagate technical manager. I will add the three references.<p>Were you at the 2012 or 2013 conference when Seagate talked about shingled recording soon? I don't see any shingled products on the store shelves that break below existing price floors. Today's announcement may or may not have an effect on minimum-cost-per-bit consumer-grade drives in the stores. I'm not talking about enterprise products, vaporware or specialty goods for particular market segments. If the 1.4 TB per disk product achieves a new cost minima (this year, in the stores, consumer grade) then it would count. The 20% forecast would put 1.3 TB per disk HDD in the stores today, based on a January 2012 start date. I'm seeing 1.0 TB per disk now. The 20% CAGR density forecast stands as the best substantiated, best referenced.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 00:47, 4 June 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:::::::::::Jeh, the current construction almost verbatim meets your neutral proposal. The range "19 to 40% per year", bounds three reliable sources, Anderson (40%), Coughlin (25%) and iSuppli May 2012 (19%).  UNESCO is at best a tertiary source since the sentence used is directly attributed to iSuppli May 2012; UNESCO appears to be an unreliable source since the quoted sentence is not supported by the iSuppli report as it is summarized in the link.  The iSuppli report is not public so we don't know exactly what is says but that really doesn't matter because the lower bound is either 20% as in UNESCO or 19% as in ISuppli May 2012.  The quoted UNESCO statement "The current roadmap predicts no more than a 20%/yr improvement in bit density" is clearly at odds with Anderson and Coughlin and misstates iSuppli in several ways so it really doesn't belong here.

He does note that retrospectively it has been in the 8-12% range but that doesn't have much to do with his prospective forecast (if u look carefully at his graph, u can see the slowing down in the transition from PW&GMR to HAMR).  Likewise the new Coughlin<ref name="Coughlin 2013-09"/> doesn't replace the original Coughlin<ref name="Coughlin" /> forecast but mere notes that "the average annual cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) in areal density is '''currently''' less than 20%." ('''emphasis added''') and that "It has been more than two years since there was an increase in the areal density of HDDs."  He does note that this has happened in the past so there is no reason to assume that this pause is any different than one in the past.  Actually his whole Forbes article is all about "research to create higher areal densities continues." For the record he is wrong about the latest increase in AD since according to my original research the latest increase in areal density was Seagate's LaCie announcement on Feb 20, 2014 of a 5 TB HDD at an AD of 826 Mb/sqin up from Toshiba's 744 on Aug 2, 2011 - indeed a long pause but not particularly relevant to this discussion since as it turns out the Toshiba increase was particularly large.  After all the above we still are left with 19% (iSuppli), 25% (Coughlin) and 40% (Anderson) as reputable sources of forecasts thru 2016 and beyond.

In a discreet event series such as areal density the absence of an event is not data and that is all Coughlin's 0% is, the absence of an event.  The way u seem to want it is until the day before an announcement the rate is 0% and on the day of this 25% announcement the CAGR is 2E37%.  I am also surprised at your continued reliance on UNESCO which is clearly a mis-statement of iSuppli; the forecast of 19% by iSuppli is not a "ceiling of 20%" as restated by UNESCO.  <br />  Regardless, as far as your complete statement goes, I don't see any disagreement now as to the facts but only its composition.

Instead of attacking their report, which isn't even relevant to this discussion as it is not present in either assessments or forecasts, it would be more relevent to find more and newer sources as you did with Coughlin(2014). Huge progress is now evidenced by your statement that you “don't see any disagreement now as to the facts”. The current assessments now stand as follows: <br>"Various industry analysts have published differing assessments of current HDD areal density compound annual growth rate: Marchon et al.

Therefore, the mathematics and the semantics say there is no floor; the rock bottom is not 8%, and the "range" is really a ceiling. <br>Density forecasts, as opposed to assessments, remain unchanged.

== Highlights In History Section ==

There are five HDD parameters whose improvements over the years are highlighted at the bottom of the [[Hard_disk_drive#History|History Section]] of this article. Most go down over time and one goes up so a ratio is used as the one consistent measurement of the improvement over time.  An IP recently added to only one of the parameters two additional measurements, the CAGR and the inverse CAGR, the latter being megabytes/$, a somewhat uncommon expression.  They have been moved to a footnote which I hope will not reappear in the section.  

It is not foolish to expect that consistency across these five parameters will be useful to the reader.  So I first think even the footnote should go.  If we want to have a second and totally redundant measurement then I suppose CAGR could be added to all five but what information does it add.  I do object strongly to the inverse, $/megabyte, either as a third measurement on Price/MB or as a sixth parameter with its measurement.  As a third measurement, who needs three and I suspect a reader will find a decreasing parameter having in increasing growth rate some what confusing.  Since it is the inverse of the more common Price/MB it would be totally redundant as a sixth parameter and furthermore has the disadvantage of not being very global.

It is pretty clear the IP added it because he wants to show it approximates a Moore's Law growth rate.  This is true but this is not the place for it.  To the IP: IMO this is better placed in the Moore Law article, or the Storage Density Article (which needs a lot of work).  I suppose it could even go into a new section in this article, but that would have to be a far more expansive coverage than just the two points in this summary part of the history section.

In summary, my recommendation is one consistent measurement, ratio, for the five parameters and kill the footnote. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 07:35, 11 August 2014 (UTC)

: Thank you for commenting on this!  How about turning the bulleted list into a table, with "Old", "New" and "Improvement" columns?

::A table would work.  The "old" parameter values are RAMAC, circa 1956.  The dates associated with the new parameter values are current but not necessarily consistent, so maybe 1956 and Current for the column heads.

{{od|6}} This compaction is an improvement, however as Dsimic put it: I think having more info in form of a note can't hurt. I restored the footnote to highlight the congruence between price and areal density.

Speaking of areal density, why isn't it on this summary chart? It's mentioned 10 times elsewhere in the article, as frequently as cost and price. To the Tom09422 editor: IMO areal density deserves a place in this table because areal density and price per byte are congruent, while Moore's law is tangential. By the way, that Memory_storage_density Article does need a lot of work, as you will see in my comment on its talk page in response to your request for citation. I did manage to find an historical HDD price reference to support the claimed HDD price over there.

To correct the areal density oversight here in this HDD article summary table, I've added areal density. Hopefully, other editors will find areal density to be as relevant to HDD performance characterization as volume (ft^3), mass (lbs) and access time (ms).[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 20:37, 11 August 2014 (UTC)

: Including areal density into the comparison table is fine with me.  However, I'd leave comments regarding the footnote to {{u|Jeh}} and {{u|Tom94022}} as I'm no longer either supporting or opposing it...  From now on, when it comes to that footnote I'm a flat line. :) &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 21:14, 11 August 2014 (UTC)

:: I am inclined to remove the footnote. One, there is a point where more information is just clutter. Two, expressing something that has undergone periodic great change interleaved with periods of relative stagnation as an "annualized percentage change" is misleading. At least the IP deigned to show up here while simultaneously edit-warring his change back into the article. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 01:11, 12 August 2014 (UTC)

::: I agree the footnote should be removed and am doing so.  
::: Speaking of Areal Density, it like many other highly technical parameters was not in the table because it is not meaningful or visible to the average consumer as are the other parameters.  So I would like to remove it but I can live with it if other editors agree, if nothing else I will put it at the bottom of the table.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 06:20, 12 August 2014 (UTC)

::::First, Jeh, the claim that storage price has undergone periodic great change interleaved with periods of relative stagnation surely sounds reasonable, but the data don't support it. Retail prices are shown on IBM Almaden Research slide 5 http://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/db2_blu_academia.pdf and also at http://www.jcmit.com/disk2014.htm Three decades show buttery-smooth storage price progress that is in fact a straight line, well characterized by an APR. Therefore, APR is useful and its stability far exceeds expectations.
::::Second, branding APR as a "misleading" indicator of unstable trends stems from an unrealistic expectation that is contrary to the widespread use of APR in technology sector and in economic indicators. GDP growth over two centuries has been routinely expressed in terms of annual rate. We know perfectly well that GDP growth wasn't constant through recessions, wars, financial panics, and depressions. APR, however imperfect, is a useful real-world descriptor of labor productivity per hour, the technical progress of microprocessors (Moore's law) and areal density. It's just the average slope of a not-perfectly-straight line, no more or less misleading than other summary descriptors.
::::This disputed deletion was hustled through in the literal dead of night, at 08:26 11 August 2014 (UTC) which is 1:26 am in California where one editor claims to be located and 4:26 am on the east coast. It's always faster for the experienced editor to act at night, without allowing the newbies to comment. I'd be interested in your reply, should you deign to do so.

:::::It is a bit disingenuous to call oneself a newbie when since Dec 2012 u have made 165 edits amounting to about 25,000 words.  U have asked that I assume [[WP:good faith]] on your part - "hustled through in the literal dead of night" doesn't read like you are willing to reciprocate.  I edit when I have the time, sometimes late at night.  Be that as it may, I think it is fair to say that HDD pricing ($/MB and $/box) had punctuated stability into the late 1980s at which point both declined at varying rates, until maybe the recent times (your "elephant").  APR may make for pretty illustrations but it can be misleading when there are no underlying linear processes.  We don't know if the Almaden data are reliable since the sources are not given and given the kinks and hickups in the data points it is likely that any AGR covering a long period of time could be misleading.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 00:32, 13 August 2014 (UTC)

{{od|6}} Tom94022, you misrepresent me and you mislead us all. First, your mislabeled "clean up" edit summary misrepresented new data that you added. Then today you only admit to an error in rounding off significant digits, a math mistake. But you do not admit to the deceptive, by omission, edit summary mislabeling.

Second, your detective work is actually an exposé on my IP address that should strike fear into the heart of any privacy-respecting editor. It sounds like you have dug deep to uncover a believable, and likely accurate, summary of IP activity from what sounds like my very own address. In fact, I don't know anything of what happened on this IP address before the spring of 2014, and I know only a portion of what happened since.

My lack of knowledge is understood easily, because you have confused me with my IP address. I am in fact a newbie, contrary to your inaccurate accusation of several years and hundreds of posts. My first post was in the spring of 2014. Because I respect both other editors' privacy and my own, I use the same IP address as a multitude of other individuals none of whom I know personally. I have no idea what they do or have done on wikipedia. I take responsibility for my own edits, and I do not deliberately misrepresent edit summaries or leave them blank out of laziness. I've made a lot of edits and contributed/written thousands of factual, unbiased, technically sound, well-referenced, high-quality words since the spring of 2014 from this IP address, alongside those other individuals whom I mentioned earlier. 

It takes a long time to learn the ropes, and appreciate how business on wikipedia is really done by experienced and forensic editors like you, sir or madam. I am thankful that I've taken basic measures to protect my privacy from the threat of inquisition that is now revealed for all to see and is posed against any editor in disagreement.

Third, I think it is fair to say that HDD prices declined at a steady rate for three decades. Here's the reference that supports this claim, slide 5:  http://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/db2_blu_academia.pdf The technical name of the underlying process described by the APR parameter is [[exponential growth]]. The effects of [[exponential growth]] are seen everywhere in the HDD industry and particularly in the first table of this WP article under the title “Improvement of HDD characteristics over time,” as well as in the Whyte graphic and in [[Moore's law]]. It is disingenuous or perhaps just mathematically dysfunctional to trumpet exponential areal density improvement, while denying the validity of annual percentage change (APR) or the historical existence of an underlying linear process of [[exponential growth]]. If these price data are unreliable and their provenance is wholly uncertain, as you would have us believe, you might share your concern with IBM Almaden Resarch in San Jose, California (and perhaps provide more authoritative data sources to them and to wikipedia as well). Guy Lohman is the name of the Research Manager who cites this price data as recently as the spring of 2014. I think these retail price data deserve their proper due, much more so than an empty cautionary warning unsupported by any substantive reference or price data.

Fourth, if you dig into the data forensically and deeply, instead of into other editors' IP address histories, you will find that the underlying price data (model numbers, dates, retail stores and advertisers) are located on the website of a Canadian former professor of information sciences. The price data are not at Almaden Research. This is contrary to your totally wrong and deceptive assertion that “We don't know if the Almaden data are reliable since the sources are not given.” The source of the data and a detailed accounting of the each of the prices are indeed given. You may recall that I showed this reference to you a month or two ago, here on this very talk page.

Fifth, drawing upon valid price data would improve the quality of this wikipedia article. This particular article wholly lacks long-term and comprehensive magnetic storage price data, and the editors actions in the last two days have even removed the one footnote detailing one example of the rate of storage price APR improvement over the span of five decades. The footnote was labeled as “clutter.” The above jcmit/IBM price reference, which you poo-poo and decry so as to sweep it under the rug while IBM Almaden Research cites it, can fill the chasm of emptiness in this article. Areal density is not the whole story, as this article misleads its readers into believing. Price improvement, a vital concern to users, has gone hand in hand with areal density growth. This article's price blindness is not the result of happenstance; the blindness is engineered deliberately by the preconceptions and agendas of those who wrote this article. As for me, I have no affiliation with the magnetic storage industry.

I support restoring the storage price footnote to this article, improving the long-standing (going back many years according to historical records) editor disharmony by writing better quality unbiased edits, stopping the deceptive edit summaries and tendentious and largely irrelevant to article quality talk-page discussions, halting false claims that a source of un-liked but accurate data is unreliable, and respecting the privacy of WP contributors and their IP address histories.

::OK, copy that. For the performance improvement table, would it not be more accurate to use characteristics for just one of the $0.05/Gbyte 3.5 inch consumer drives across the board (weight, volume, etc.) rather than mixing and matching the best characteristics from various different products that could never be combined into one real product (low weight, small volume, lowest price, highest areal density, etc.)? The baseline 1956 product characteristics were not mixed and matched: they were all from just one real product.

::: Hm, regarding what to use for comparisons in the overview table...  It all depends on one's point of view, and to me all technology advancements in the HDD industry are equally important.  Thus, it might be more suitable to "cherry pick" highlights from multiple current products, as that shows better where the HDDs currently are.  For example, there are 1.8-inch HDDs that aren't the cheapest, largest or fastest, but they're lighweight and have small volume; then, there's also a variety of large, relatively cheap and quite fast 3.5-inch drives, etc.  These examples show two pretty much disparate product categories, but they both "show off" areas of the progress achieved so far.  At the same time, IBM 350 disk storage unit (a component of the IBM 305 RAMAC computer system) is the first HDD, thus there isn't much to "cherry pick" from on that side of the comparisons.  That's just my opinion, of course.
::: By the way, we might consider [[microdrive]]s to be used in the overview table, as they have much smaller volume and weight than 1.8-inch HDDs. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 08:49, 14 August 2014 (UTC)

::::FWIW, I think "cherry picking" from among the current drives is most appropriate for this section where we are trying to give the reader an overview of the progress from RAMAC to date.

:::::This nitpicking brings to mind Voltaire: the [[perfect is the enemy of good]]. This reference is better than leaving the price vacuum. Editors should at least be concrete when disputing citations, not pontificate darkly: “there are all sorts of things wrong with the IP's cite, I just don't have time to respond in detail”. IBM Almaden Research also uses this cite: it's IBM's cite too. I think the retail prices deserve their proper due, much more so than unsupported warnings (FUD). 

:::::Yes, this table depends on one's point of view. Looking at rounding precision leaves important questions hanging. Whether technical benchmarks ought to be considered in isolation or in an integrated HDD hinges on a fundamental issue: what's the subject of this article? Does it examine the progress of HDDs (always a happy story), the HDD as an integrated system, or the HDD as an assemblage of parts? If it's about the system, then à la carte benchmarks are bait, and real users inevitably switch to an integrated system. Marketers respond to today's reality by saying “we've come a long way,” “we're making good progress” in reference to the rate of improvement or APR, and promise great things on the “roadmap.” This HDD article has a bit of each.

:::::Flash memory rendered [[microdrive]]s obsolete, though used examples might still be found on ebay. Any narrow focus on technical capability will eventually be blindsided by lack of demand. The tide of technical change has turned, and certain benchmarks have already receded from their high water marks. While progress (areal density, perhaps) may march forward, those roads on the map aren't yet built, and no particular technology is assured of advancement or even of survival. Extinction is the natural result of [[creative destruction]] ''schöpferische Zerstörung'', an idea that carries vestiges of Marxism. Were it not for a lack of demand impeding growth, we could still build faster Concordes, better horse buggies, and smaller microdrives. 

:::::A Model T automobile in one column shouldn't be compared with the price of a Yugo, the speed of a Ferrari, and the efficiency of a solar-powered car in the adjacent column. A WP article on the subject of automobiles ought to compare the Model T with a Toyota Corolla or VW Golf. Henry Ford and IBM RAMAC would surely fare better in this comparison had they optimized separately for each benchmark. 

:::::This table should give a 30,000 foot view. To keep things simple, it should list a consumer product because enterprise HDDs are a small part of the market and transaction prices are not transparent. High water marks belong in the “History of HDDs” article, and/or farther down in the technical subsections of this HDD article, and/or broken out as separate headings like “1956 system,” “Current HDD,” “Improvement” ratios for a current system, and “Bests” or “Historic bests” for the smallest microdrive, cheapest (per byte) HDD, and biggest capacity HDD.

The source for the actual data is the IBM 1981 JRD article, "a Quarter Century of Disk File Innovation" except for the 2311 which is not in the article but its date is the FCS of the first System/360 and its AD is exactly 2 x the 1311.  The AD errors are not systematic and can be as large as 8%.  The JRD article only gave year of shipment and 5 out of the 7 data points have the wrong year; for the two products with known FCS months, one is off by almost a year.  There other errors or omissions in Whyte such as not correctly identifying the 2006 state-of-the-art, leaving out the double density 350 and I suspect others.

Don't get me wrong, I think Whyte did a great job and is a reliable source as it stands in graphic form, but it is not usable for establishing a trend line to one decimal digit for purposed of comparing to 41.4%. 

We don't know whether Whyte was in error or the errors were introduced by the IP's process or some combination of both, but this sample of 7 of the 42 data points, along with other errors or omissions demonstrates why calculating a trend line to one decimal digit in this manner is a case of garbage in and garbage out.

== Stability of slope ==

Slope calculations are moot, because [[WP:NOR]] disallows editor analysis. Updating seven points (-3%, 0%, 3%, 2%, -3%, 8%, and -4%) would not change the slope significantly. With 7 updated and 35 more recent data points, slope would increase from 40.9% to 41.2% per year, still similar to Moore's law.

:Since the [[WP:OR|policy of no original research does not apply to talk pages]] updating 7 out of 42 points is perfectly permissible.  Given six out of the first seven points u use are incorrect as to AD or date or both, there can be no doubt that most if not all of the remaining 35 points are in error. This means that any slope calculated to one decimal digit from this inaccurate data is meaningless (garbage in garbage out).  You could fix all the points, including adding the missing ones (e.g. IBM 350-3, Toshiba, etc.) but that would be original research and if you did it I suspect you would discover a trend line greater than 41.4.  But the trend line is still meaningless when we are talking about actual data points which may be above or below a trend line, meaning the actual growth at that point is above or below the trend.

::There's no need to speculate endlessly. Just update the remaining 35 data points and recalculate the 42-point slope. The slope, regardless of data revisions, has been shown to be stable. The slope was 40.9% per year or about 41% and after updating 7 of the 42 points the slope is still 41.2% or about 41%.

::The slope calculation is moot, because [[WP:NOR]] relies on authoritative sources not calculations by editors. Reliable sources (Plumer, Tuomi, Marchon) indicate the density improvement rate was similar to, a little more or a little less than, Moore's law over five decades.

::::No, that smells Faustian. The calculation based on all 42 points, is much more accurate and reliable than your two-point calculation of slope. The straw man here is the issue of measuring point by point, which just diverts attention from the actual stability of (42 point) slope. [[WP:NOR]] states that editor calculations must give way to reliable sources. No reliable reference has said that Moore's law lagged areal density improvement over five decades. In fact, Plumer, Tuomi and Marchon indicate that density growth was similar to Moore's law. Albeit moot, the slope of all valid data points is stable (41% per year with 7 updated points and 35 original points) and entails less editor manipulation and obfuscation than the moot and unreliable slope of just two points.

:Regarding comparison to Moore's Law (ML), the long term, that is, from the invocation of Moore's law circa 1965 shows magnetic areal density (AD) growing at a slightly higher rate than ML and during the 90s and into the 00s at a much higher rate.  Both AD and ML appear to be slowing down in this decade due to fundamental physical limits so the original statement is accurate while the reverted change is perhaps misleading by equating ML and AD into this century.  Therefore I reverted the edit.   It would be possible to fix the edit by removing the reference to ML but since most people know of Moore's law I the comparison is useful and should remain as is without getting into in which decade AD did or did not exceed ML.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 17:56, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
The Moore's law reference does not document HDD AD long term; however the Coughlin reference does document 1990-2010 specifically. Could you provide a reference for longer term HDD? (It's certainly in the 25-100% ballpark for 1962-2014, I would imagine). The point is that the recent HDD AD trend has slowed, as Coughlin(2012) indicated.

::: This is in response to the entry you titled expansively,
  "Fair and accurate comparison to Moore's law wikipedia entry". 
::: First, I'll discuss the accuracy deficit in detail (and in a sense "authoritatively"), then the fairness issue, and finally propose an improvement to the article. 

Thanks for pointing to Whyte (2009) areal density data, and to the Moore's law wikipedia entry. I had already come across that wiki entry, and this did not happen by chance. 

I wrote that entry. You may be surprised to learn, that although I'm just a new Wikipedia user with no tie to the storage industry, I recently authored that particular new section. I'm glad to see that my work has found an audience. Wikipedia articles can have unexpected consequences. 

As I wrote, MPU prices improved about 30% per year (halving every two years) before and after the thoroughly-researched late-1990s surge of technical advancement. Therefore, I can certainly explain for “u” Sir/Madam what that “30%” means, and how you appear to have misunderstood it. 

You should be careful to distinguish between growth (a performance increase, with a certain doubling time) as opposed to decline (price improvement). The article says MPU prices halved every two years. The -30% annual decline rate is equivalent to a performance increase of 
  (1 / (100% – 30% / year) - 1) = +43% CAGR. 
The halving time offers a way to double-check the calculation, 
  exp( ln(0.5) / 2 years) – 100% = -29% per year; 
so halving time would really be closer to 1.94 years, or   
  exp( ln(0.5) / 1.94 years) – 100% = -30% per year.

::: So, you “really should” use the +43% MPU performance CAGR increase, not the -30% / year price decline, to compare against areal density growth. The disk areal density slopes +40% per year in the reference you kindly provided (Whyte, 2009 of IBM). 
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/storagevirtualization/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/areal_2.jpg). 
::: Whyte's silicon density slope of +34% CAGR almost parallels the aforementioned disk areal density slope. As Whyte(2009) explains explicitly these two have tracked together, “Another interesting side note can be seen when you add the areal density of silicon, which to this day has tracked almost scarily to Moores Law.” 

Given the similarity between these trend slopes, judging which slope is “somewhat higher” would require one to perform a statistical test against some confidence value (p-value). You haven't provided any statistical reference that would support a conclusion as to which is higher. I suggest you return to the original “not substantially/substantively different” phrasing, instead of minting the new and unsupported claim of “somewhat higher.”  

The slowing of Moore's law that you pointed to is neither here nor there. The 30% figure is way, way off base because it confuses performance growth with price decline as I have shown, and because it refers to MPUs some time ago. It does not refer to SSDs recently. 

What really matters for HDDs is the recent SSD (relative) price trend. These data are available. From 2010 to 2013 SSD prices trended at the usual Moore's law rate and halved every two years, a capacity increase of around 40-45% per year. For reference, the following sources give recent SSD price trends: 
http://techreport.com/review/23149/ssd-prices-in-steady-substantial-decline
http://www.storagenewsletter.com/rubriques/market-reportsresearch/when-will-ssd-have-same-price-as-hdd-priceg2/

In conclusion, during the 2010-2013 time period, the gap in terms of price per unit storage of information between SSD (40-45% growth per year of density) and HDD (10-25% growth) has narrowed by a factor of two or three. This is the headwind HDDs face.

I admonish you to look at the rules at the top of this page. 
“Be polite, and welcoming to new users” (like me!). 
“Assume good faith.” Accusing me of reverting “without a basis other than u just don't like it” does not assume good faith. 
“Avoid personal attacks.” Now as for me here, I'm just writing this in self defense. 
I see now that veteran industry marketing professionals employ a bare-knuckles, frank and direct style to get a commercial message out on heavily-trafficked and respected internet sites, to suppress inconvenient information and to stand guard over the community's content zealously as if it were owned privately. Even so, I would counsel you to renounce the commercialism that, at least from my own point of view, has been allowed to pervade this content of this HDD article. 

I direct your attention to an example of commercial bias found in this article's “future development” section. Current version:    
“New magnetic storage technologies are being developed to support higher areal density growth, address the superparamagnetic limit, and maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with potentially competitive products such as flash memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs).”
Obviously SSDs do compete, and are mischaracterized here as merely "potentially competitive." 
A less slanted approach would indicate that HDDs and flash memory are often complementary rather than exclusive. Proposed revision:
“HDDs store most of the information in the world, and this is expected to continue because of their low cost and long retention times. HDDs face competition for some information storage applications from flash memory. [[Hierarchical storage management]] combines several storage types to improve overall cost and performance: faster but costly technologies such as SSDs and/or DRAM are joined with slower but less costly HDDs or tape. For example, the [[Fusion Drive]] is one of many commercial products that combine a small SSD and large HDD. New magnetic storage technologies are being developed to support higher areal density growth and address the superparamagnetic limit, as follows:”

IBM RAMAC in 1956 was a product. It would not be fair to compare a product like RAMAC with a lab demo. This lab_demo versus real_product confusion is widespread. According to, http://www.storagenewsletter.com/rubriques/market-reportsresearch/ihs-isuppli-storage-space/<br>“in 2010, the highest areal density that could be achieved for a platter amounted to 550Gb per square inch.” This compares to 635 Gbit/in2 from IBM(2013).

:::::::::::May I suggest you are not only unmooring the goalpost when you extend the interval beyond 2010, you are also venturing into [[WP:OR|original research]] when you concatenate different data sources, extract data points from graphs, adjust data points and then attempt to draw conclusions therefrom.  First point is that we know that since about 2005 HDD AD CAGR has been less than 41%/year so each year you extend beyond Whyte will reduce the LT CAGR - why not go all the way to May 30, 2014, to make a point?  More importantly your ability to extract accurate data from these low resolution graphs is limited so one can only conclude that your analysis fails to prove your hypothesis that the LT HDD AD CAGR is less than Moore's law.  The endpoint data on the other hand are accurate. If you want to get the actual data and run it thru 2010 (or 2009) then you might have a point.  Whyte data show a LT AD CAGR exceeding ML from 1956 to 2010 and the endpoint data confirm it to 2009 and 2010.  Other accurate endpoint tests also confirm LT AD CAGR exceeding ML from 1956 to 2003.  We have a confirmed reliable source for the LT HDD AD CAGR (1956-2010) exceeds ML; if u can find a reliable source that says otherwise then you might have a point.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 02:40, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::One last point about yr data - apparently u have added points from other trend lines, e.g., 1957 to 1961 - after RAMAC in 1956 I think the next data point might be 1962 or so.  This is statistically invalid as only the actual data points should be used to fit a straight line.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 02:52, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::::You point to an “hypothesis that the LT HDD AD CAGR is less than Moore's law.” But, this never had to be proven, and the evidence for this is no better than the evidence for the reverse. Both ways, it's too fuzzy to call.<p>Only the following is disputed: firstly, the original HDD article before 25 May had “not substantively different from Moore's Law.” Secondly, the new version after 25 May claims “somewhat higher”. The issue isn't the value, positive or negative, of the difference. It's simply that there is no statistical justification to distinguish between the two, one way or the other. Though I'm still open to looking at your data, as you wrote, “If u dispute this I will be happy to Photoshop the graph to prove the point.”<p>Your deconstruction of the data shows that the slopes have a lot of slop. Moore's law is exact by definition only, not in reality. As Gordon Moore (1995) wrote of Moore's law, “I did not expect much precision in this estimate.” I'd put Kryder's law (1990-2010 or even 1956-2013) at 25-100% per year. Not 40.66% per year. Around 40% per year historically would even be fine by me. The author of the original version of the article set the bar, long before 25 May, pretty low. Where it should be. It's easy to demonstrate insufficient support for a claim, but harder to prove it. Given the weak support for the aggressive claim of distinguishability, it would be prudent to return to the long-standing uncontroversial formulation.[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 18:19, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::::Actually it is your hypothesis that the LT HDD AD CAGR is less than or equal to Moore's law that has to be proven since the evidence from a reliable source, Whyte, is that over the time period 1956 - 2009 it exceeded ML.  So far you have only confirmed Whyte.  I have a longer response in mind but I am pretty busy this week so I probably won't post it until next weekend.

::::::::::::::I'd delete those (few) early years with missing data, and fit by least squares again. The results wouldn't change drastically, I expect. I'll try later, when I've time.<br>Your claim is that the two slopes are significantly, in the statistical sense, different. (“somewhat higher”) Mine is that there is insufficient evidence to show that long term Kryder's law and Moore's law (both fuzzy in the real world) slopes are different. (“not substantively different”) That's the text before 25 May.<p>I oppose the change of 25 May, because I've no good evidence to support a “significant” difference or “somewhat higher” slope.

::::::::::::::::You point to sparseness of Whyte(2009) data for the early decades, and by extension the sparseness of IBM, Grochowski and most of the available the density data. Grochowski (2003)<br>http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos598E/bib/grochowski.pdf<br>shows rapid density acceleration in the 1990s and very steep acceleration before the mid-1960s when the industry was just starting. This is the same density story as Whyte(2009).<p>I do take areal density with a grain of salt, and not just because of the lab_demo versus shipping_product confusion. The data sources are few, because IBM/HGST produced much of the storage and have disseminated their version of the story widely for decades. Therefore density is difficult to corroborate independently. Density is a technical parameter, a step removed from real prices. Importantly, prices have more economic relevance and reality to users, buyers, the producer price index, labor productivity and the national GDP. Density is less generalizable than price: it's harder to measure the areal density of a ferrite core or a flipflop or a DRAM. Density could be another rabbit hole (or more commonly a squirrel hole) atop the Santa Teresa hills near the green Almaden Research oasis. Prices, by the same token, would be more realistic if they were adjusted for quality. But this is what we've got.<p>No worries. Since there are quite enough data, I won't need a lot of luck. McCallum(2014) has independent retail-level (or list price in the early years) prices that go back decades.<br>http://www.jcmit.com/disk2014.htm<br>http://www.jcmit.com/diskprice.htm<p>The magnetic storage price trend post 1980 slope parallels semiconductor Moore's law (semiconductor is flash since around 2007, preceded by DRAM, preceded by older forms of rapid-access-main_memory devices like flipflops and ferrite core) price slope. During the 1980s and again now, HDD prices were one order of magnitude better than the closest DRAM/flash semiconductor alternative. Theses two slopes are parallel. The non-magnetic price slope holds all the way back to the 1950s, around -38%/year (1957-2014). HDD prices improved very rapidly by -55% per year (not quite -60% to -100% per year) from the early-1990s to early-2000s. Prices continued to improve at the very strong pace of -47% per year during 2000-2009. HDD prices since January 2010 (two years before the floods) to now (two and a half years after the floods) have improved by only 10% per year.<p>Conclusion: during the last three decades, the HDD price (not density) slope has not been substantively different from the semiconductor price slope. Prior to the mid-1970s, magnetic storage price improvement lagged. Particularly since 2010, the HDD price slope around -10% per year has been very much slower than flash memory (Moore's law) slope around -36% per year. In the last year or so HDD prices improved (dropped) by slightly better than 20%. Long term over five decades, I've still no good evidence to support a “significant” difference or “somewhat higher” slope for HDD price progress over Moore's price progress. The difference (pos or neg) could go either way.<p>I dispute the new "somewhat higher" slope claim of 25 May.[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 20:41, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

Even Plumer supports an AD CAGR greater than Moore's law from 1955 thru 2005 - let me spell it out for you:
*"Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR)of about 40% in the first 35 years." 
*"The growth in CAGR from 40% to 60% to 100% which began in the mid 1990s and spanned the following several years (Fig 1)Fig 1 depicts 100%/year from 1998-2002
Whyte shows the 60-100% CAGR extending from the early 1992 to 2004.  If u combine 38 years of 40% with 12 years of 60-100% you will get about 49% per year which well exceeds Moore's Law.  My quick and dirty calculation says that it takes only two years of 80% per year to raise 40%/year to 41.4% over a 50 year span.  So given the periods of very high growth rates it seems obvious that HDD AD CAGR had to exceed ML (at least until very recently).
You seem to prefer Plumer over Kryder - in 2005 Plumer was an engineer at Seagate while Kryder was Seagate's Chief Technical Officer and Senior Vice President, Research and University Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University. I think Kryder quoted is at least as reliable a source as a Plumer paper.
Finally Plumer's approximately 40% only covers the first 35 years and not 1955-2005 so it doesn't contradict any statement about such a longer period, particularly since he agrees that for many years there after the rate substantially exceeded a Moore's Law rate. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 09:15, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
:You have cited Walter (2005), but this remains unverified. You say Kryder is an expert. While correct, this is irrelevant. Kryder did not write the headline nor the Walter (2005) article. The 5 decade interval is 1956–2010; no reason to switch to 2005. You cry Kryder, Kryder, Kryder, but what does Kryder say in the Walter (2005) citation with respect to the five decades? Nothing, specifically. Where is the “Kryder quoted” to which you refer? Nowhere, exactly. So the question remains: which part of Walter (2005) supports the five decade claim?<p>Your parsing of Plumer (2011) represents original research [[WP:OR]]. I need not spell it out for you, instead Plumer will: “In order to achieve the approximate 40% compound areal density growth rate that the HDD industry has delivered over the past 50 years, several key technology innovations have been employed." Here, Plumer says 40% and 50 years. You now characterize Plumer as a low-level engineer, and move from an appeal to Kryder's authority to an ad hominem attack. Regardless of organizational rank, Plumer, a magnetic storage engineer in 2011, is a more reliable source for 1956–2010 technology assessment than Walter, a writer in 2005.<p>Plumer did not say 49%; you do, using [[WP:OR]] methods. But in view of the high degree of statistical uncertainty, even your [[WP:OR]] fabricated 49% is similar to the Moore's law rate. Not “higher than;” not “well exceeds.” Plumer's “approximate 40%” has one significant digit, and does not disagree with 49%. It's not precisely 40.00%. Moore's law is so fuzzy that some quote a 24-month doubling time and others 18 months.<p>“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,” to quote some writer. Moore's law progress was similar to areal density growth during 1956–2010. It stands once more, twice more, a dozen times more, at least for a few years until data for 1956–2016 are available. The Wikipedia article was correct prior to your 25 May edit: “not substantially different than the 40% per year [[Moore's Law]] growth.”<p>“Or close the wall up” (the very next line from that same passage) with a reference that can stand up to verification, not with job titles from a Rolodex.[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 20:14, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
:#An interview by Walter of Mark Kryder published in Scientific American is a reliable source and does not require verification.  Nor is it necessary to have specific quotes; Walter's paraphrasing of Kryder is sufficient.  Unless u can find something by Kryder disavowing Walter there is no reason to exclude it nor not attribute it to Kryder. 
:#[[WP:CALC|Routine calculations do not count as original research, provided there is consensus among editors that the result of the calculation is obvious, correct, and a meaningful reflection of the sources.]]  You will probably not agree that my calculations are routine, etc. even though you have used such calculations in your several failed attempts to show a CAGR <41%.  Perhaps some other editors will join the discussion
:#Apparently you agree that in some contexts 49% is approximately Moore's law, so that u must agree than approximately 40% can NOT disprove an hypothesis that the CAGR of areal density was greater than Moore's law thru at least 2006.  In which case u should stop reverting or changing on the basis of Plumer.
:#Moore's law is not fuzzy - doubling every 24 months = 41.4% CAGR.  The observed data trend is either greater than or less than that number. Whyte has about 60 data points - unfortunately we don't have the underlying data but we must presume good faith.  AD is known with great precision and accuracy, shipping date is less accurate, but for you to say there is no statistical difference between the Whyte trend and ML is sophistry.
:#The reason to cut back the observation from Whyte to 2005 or 2006 is that where there is the latest clear kink in the curve; but note even extended to 2010 Whyte AD is above ML.  The point is that since the mid 2000s HDD AD has not been progressing as fast as it had done so in the past.  I think this is the message the reader needs to hear.
::Actually this whole thing started when u, without explanation, removed all reference to Moore's Law and then refused to accept it until confronted with Whyte among others.  I think I actually wrote the original phrase, "not substantially different" but only after u forced a reference did I find the evidence that HDD AD has actually out-performed ML over a long period of time, at least until recently.  Perhaps other editor's seeing this now the posted graphic from Whyte will help them see this also.

:::The proposed lede is wrong, very wrong. The areal density on the Whyte graphic is “similar to” not “likely exceeding” Moores law (41.4% per year). There is no “flabbergastingly rapid” rate, if one considers areal density in the context of Moore's law. This breathless prose, this hype, violates [[WP:NPOV]]. The areal density slowdown began in the early 2000s, not the late 2000s.

::::You continue to confuse a trend line with the actual data points; any given data point may be above or below a trend line.  It is indisputable that the actual growth rate for AD from 2005-2009 when measured from the shipment of the prototype RAMAC to that of the state-or-the-art AD exceeds an annual compound rate of 41.4% for each of the years 2005-2009 as shown in Whyte.  It is true thereafter using the data points from other sources.  That is shown by the graphic and is confirmed by your data.  
::::It is not reasonable to draw your precise conclusions from your trend line analysis of Whyte since the data points are likely to be imprecise due to if nothing else error introduced by translation of these points into an image and compressing it into a jpg.  For example, the RAMAC point:

::::::Each of your derived data points suffer from such errors so that any trend line is at best approximate.  It is also  original research in that there is no consensus that this is reasonable transformation.  Regardless, any trend line is not data and so irrelevant to this question
::::Wikipedia is not a copying machine nor do we editors necessarily have to precisely describe a reference.  2005 or 2006 is clearly a breaking point and therefore it is acceptable even desirous to reflect that date in the section lede.  The only reason I can see to break at 2009 or 2010 per the end of Whyte is to extend time giving a slightly lower CAGR from the beginning (slightly lower but still >ML CAGR), which while true is not particularly helpful to the reader. Dividing the times discussed into 1956-2006 and then 2006 to present makes good sense in the context of Whyte and many other reliable sources.
::::Although there is a reliable source for "flabergastingly" it is not necessary so I will move it to a foot note but you have yet again failed to provide any evidence beyond your [[WP:POV|point of view]] and your [[WP:OR|original research]] so I will again change the lede along these lines.

:::::::Ignorance of [[least squares regression]] is not an option if one is make a convincing quantitative assessment of dissimilarity. The technique is well described in Wikipedia. Rhetoric and endpoints won't do. Because each point has measurement error, [[least squares regression]] includes all the data points, not just the endpoints. Even if one were to (incorrectly, sloppily, perhaps even deceptively) cherry-pick the endpoints (1956-2009), this would still be 43% per year: similar to Moore's law. It is not reasonable to exclude those 40 data points between the endpoints. The slope of all the data points (40.9% per year) is similar to Moore's law.<p>At the same time, Tuomi showed that Moore's law has very large error bars. His article is almost novella-length at 14,000 words, but education isn't free: often it takes a substantial investment of time. Tuomi published in a peer-reviewed journal, not a blog or company-sponsored marketing slides.<br>TUOMI, Ilkka. The Lives and Death of Moore's Law. First Monday, [S.l.], nov. 2002. ISSN 13960466.

The abstract follows:{{cquote|Moore’s Law has been an important benchmark for developments in microelectronics and information processing for over three decades. During this time, its applications and interpretations have proliferated and expanded, often far beyond the validity of the original assumptions made by Moore. Technical considerations of optimal chip manufacturing costs have been expanded to processor performance, economics of computing, and social development. It is therefore useful to review the various interpretations of Moore’s Law and empirical evidence that could support them.<p>Such an analysis reveals that semiconductor technology has evolved during the last four decades under very special economic conditions. In particular, the rapid development of microelectronics implies that economic and social demand has played a limited role in this industry. Contrary to popular claims, it appears that the common versions of Moore’s Law have not been valid during the last decades. As semiconductors are becoming important in economy and society, Moore’s Law is now becoming an increasingly misleading predictor of future developments.}}
:::::::Moore's law is fuzzy indeed, and areal density has grown at a rate similar to Moore's law over the span of more than five decades as noted explicitly by Plumer (2011).

::::::::I'm not sure of the relevance of your lecture on least squares regression and your citation to Tuomi. You continue to misuse trend lines instead of the actual data points.  BTW I can't find any error bars in Tuomi; he shows that the data points have very large deviations (errors) from the trend line, not the other way around. A compound growth rate on semi log paper is a straight line.  A trend line might have a bound if one entered the data points with their error bars and ran some sort of Monte Carlo analysis to establish confidence intervals.  But this would still be irrelevant to the simple mathematical statement that 43 > 41.4.
::::::::You agree that the AD CAGR from RAMAC to 2009 is 43%. I am sure u will agree that it is greater than 43% for each of the years 2005 thru 2007. Surely you cannot deny that 43 ><strike><</strike> 41.4.  There is very little error in the two points, mainly in the dates so the difference between 41.3 and >43 is significant.  Since we appear to be in agreement, that should end this discussion. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 03:26, 6 August 2014 (UTC)<br /><br />

:::::::::No agreement could be apparent to any rational observer. Clearly, this is disputed material. While there is a desire to terminate the discussion unilaterally, the desire is unrealistic and termination would be shortsighted. To paraphrase wikipedia guidelines, no agreement is required; consensus does not mean unanimity which is not always achievable; nor is it the result of a vote. Further discussion, however unwelcome on the part of certain editor(s), may provide future editors with insight into the two alternatives: density growth over five decades that was “similar to” or “somewhat exceeding” Moore's law.<br />

:::::::::I can and do deny that "43 < 41.4"; because, mathematically this is wrong. In fact given the uncertainties that limit our confidence in this comparison, 43 is approximately equal to 41.4, and the figure of 41.4 should be seen as 40-ish not as precisely 41.421356237. Furthermore, 43 just relies on two endpoints: [[linear regression]] using all the data points gives 40.9 which is 41-ish or 40-ish.<br />

:::::::::In the first place, the slope of Moore's law itself is fuzzy according to Tuomi. It's not 41.4214% per year.[http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html The Lives and Death of Moore's Law] – By [[Ilkka Tuomi]]<br />

:::::::::Secondly, Plumer (2011) found that areal density grew about 40% per year over the past 50 years: “In order to achieve the approximate 40% compound areal density growth rate that the HDD industry has delivered over the past 50 years, several key technology innovations have been employed." <ref>{{cite journal

:::::::::Thirdly, the [[linear regression]] slope of areal density for all 42 data points from the graphic (Whyte) is 40.9% per year, similar to Moore's law.<br />

:::::::::Fourth and finally, Marchon (2013) indicates that areal density grew at “the historical, Moore's law equivalent of ~40%/annum.”<ref name="Marchon2013a">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1155/2013/521086|title=The Head-Disk Interface Roadmap to an Areal Density of Tbit/in2|journal=Advances in Tribology|volume=2013|pages=1|year=2013|last1=Marchon|first1=Bruno|last2=Pitchford|first2=Thomas|last3=Hsia|first3=Yiao-Tee|last4=Gangopadhyay|first4=Sunita}} "the compound annual growth rate has reduced considerably from ~100%/annum in the late 1990s to 20–30% today.

:::::::::Therefore according to multiple credible sources, namely Tuomi, Plumer(2011), the Whyte graphic, and very particularly and specifically Marchon(2013), areal density grew at a rate similar to (“equivalent” according to Marchon et al.) Moore's law over the interval of more than five decades. [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.14|71.128.35.14]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.14|talk]]) 18:08, 6 August 2014 (UTC)

::::::::::I think 43 <strike> < </strike> <b>></b> 41.4 is obvious from the data underlying 43 but since you assert there are uncertainties please state what u think are the uncertainties in your 43% and I will do a worst case analysis to show the lowest possible bound.  Addressing your points by number:
::::::::::#You misstate the implications of Toumi.  The slope of Moore's Law is not fuzzy; the performance of the semiconductor industry has deviated from a "Moore's Law" and Moore's Law has not always been doubling in 24 months.  He has nothing relevant about the CAGR of HDD AD from RAMAC to any specific date.
::::::::::#Plumer's approximately 40% could be an actual number as high as 44.5% which again has no relevance to the actual number.
::::::::::#You continue to confuse a trend line with the actual data.  Furthermore, your trend line derived from Whyte has inherent noise you introduced that does not allow any meaningful comparison to 41.4....
::::::::::#Marchon's “the historical, Moore's law equivalent of ~40%/annum” is not qualified as to time, just an ambiguous historical.  The only graphic goes only to 1990.  Since the period he is referencing is unknown it is your unsupported assertion applies it back to RAMAC.
::::::::::Accordingly, none of your multiple credible sources, namely Tuomi, Plumer(2011), the Whyte graphic, and Marchon(2013) deny that the AD CAGR from RAMAC to 2006 was according to you 43%.  While it is likely true that a trend line thru the leading edge AD data points to 2006 has a CAGR of about 41.4%, it is also possible that such a trend line may exceed 41.4%.  You have not identified such a trend line, your trend line derived from Whyte is fatally flawed for this analysis by your methodology and most important it is not clear that a trend line is anymore relevant than a two point analysis, particularly since any two points of Whyte can be determined with a high degree of precision and none of the points are outliers.

You really don't respond to anything, just continue to produce more evidence that never supports your position which btw has always been to minimize the areal density growth.  But the good news is your edit to the price section seems to be an admission that a two point analysis is meaningful.  In the continuing absence of your response I shall shortly post a worst case two point analysis that the CAGR between RAMAC and 2006 is significantly greater than 41.4.

:::::::::::::You may also recall my several earlier responses to this issue. [[Linear regression]] must calculate slope from all available valid data points, not just the endpoints while excluding all the data points in-between. This means all 42 points should be included for Whyte, and both of the points for the 300-million-fold calculation. By the way, two point slopes are subsumed by and fully incorporated in the mathematical technicque of [[linear regression]].<br />
:::::::::::::Two-point [[linear regression]]s are only meaningful if only two points are present. Otherwise, the [[linear regression]] should include all available valid data points. Once again, you appear to have overlooked repeatedly my several earlier responses in a continuing misunderstanding of the mathematical requirements of [[linear regression]].

I fully understand linear regression, having used it many time in my career, usually to predict the future.

Your data from Whyte shows that the actual growth from RAMAC to each of the years 2005-2009 exceeded a 41.4% CAGR as does the graphic now posted.  You have yet to answer why u think the uncertainties of a two point analysis are such that one cannot drawn any conclusion as to its relationship to 41.4.  Let's leave Moore out of this, why isn't your 43% statistically a number larger than 41.4?  I will shortly post a proof that in the worst case the CAGR of AD from RAMAC to 2006 exceeds 41.4 by a significant amount.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:20, 7 August 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::::::You wrote that the growth rate for the 300-million-fold improvement “btw should have been 40% from 1956.42 to 2014.00”.  Two decimal points might be overstating the precision of dating here. On 5 August you wrote that ''Ramac Actual'' was actually 1956.70. The 1956.42 date does not show up anywhere else, and no source ever dates RAMAC in the first half of 1956. It is always reported in the second half of the calendar year. So based on ''Ramac Actual'' in the second half of 1956, the growth rate should be 41% not 40% per year.<p>

:::::::::::::::One cannot leave Moore out of this for the sake of expediency. Moore's law is very fuzzy, as Tuomi has shown in 14,000 words of detailed explanation.<br><br>
:::::::::::::::Rather than answering the rather negative and inconvenient question of why not calculate slope from just two endpoints, I prefer to look at the positive side and will present instead “[[A Modest Proposal]]” for why one would use just two endpoints. Two-point forecasts are a well known tool of storage industry marketing professionals, consultants, and sales people. The technique has enormous advantages when applied to the Whyte graphic, because [[linear regression]] based on all data points not just the two endpoints restricts one's freedom to manipulate data and rig results.<br>

:::::::::::::::Just by selecting the “right” endpoints and excluding all of the data points from the middle, the two-point method can deliver almost any slope the user wants. Let's start by considering the Whyte endpoints, 1956–2009. In order to maximize slope over many decades, it is best to select the 1956 start point because density was really quite dismal in the beginning. Renaming the starting point for marketing purposes, to enshrine it in the mind of the reader and set it in stone: '''''RAMAC_Actual'''''–2009 gives slope of 43% per year. Switching to various different endpoints in the 2006–2009 time frame shows that slope holds steady near 43% per year, so one can demonstrate an apparent and false pseudo-stability. Now let's see what would happen if the interval were reduced by six years: with 1956–2003.9 the slope jumps to 45%. Reducing the interval by lopping off six years from the start and looking at 1962.6 (the ''RAMAC 2 plus''?)–2009 would reduce the slope to around 39%.<br>

:::::::::::::::[[Linear regression]] with all the data points gives a single statistical best (meaning smallest margin of error), but not best for marketing, slope estimate of 40.9% per year, a far cry from the flexibility and multiplicity of different slopes offered by two-point forecasts. Experienced, wiley and cunning practitioners of the art consider many alternative endpoint scenarios to maximize the slope, looking for unusual upward spikes near the end or dips at the beginning like ''RAMAC Actual'' 1956 in order to cherry-pick a maximum slope.<br>

:::::::::::::::Two-point forecasting certainly is an essential tool of any storage industry marketing and sales professional who seeks to tailor the data to fit the message, not the reverse. It works just as well on the rapidly growing flash memory market as it does on the stagnant magnetic storage market.<br>

:::::::::::::::Obviously these mathematical techniques are not as important as setting strategic goals, targeting the right market, crafting a message that resonates with the audience and deploying that message across appropriate media to the customer audience. From the very first days of wikipedia, editors have frequently discussed the issue of being one of the media that can be employed, very cost effectively one might add, to deliver marketing messages. Social media is the hottest trend in advertising. Wikipedia remains relevant today in this context because it should properly be seen as a popular, respected and trusted form of social media.<br>

<br />
(un-indented)Don't look for any reference regarding 40% versus 41%. This observation is just two points in 2H1956 and YE2013 with a ratio of 300 million, not 30 billion, to one. The math is routine and verifiable. It is both foolish and astoundingly tendentious to pursue 40% instead of 41%, because this difference is not significant like that factor of one hundred pricing error, 300 million versus 30 billion.<br />
Furthermore, we agree that dates in the second half of 1956 are supported solidly, though one date in the first half of 1956 may exist. Even if we were to take into consideration all four (4) date candidates that you now propose, the median date would still be in the second half of 1956. You are one of the select few IBM-specialist magnetic-storage historians, quite distinct from most readers of this article, who would be interested to hear that a conflicting date of 13 September instead of 14 September appears even today in wikipedia: “The IBM 350 disk storage unit, the first disk drive, was announced by IBM as a component of the [[IBM 305 RAMAC]] computer system on September 13, 1956.” All these citations are found in the second half of 1956.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html |title=IBM Archives: IBM 350 disk storage unit |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://chmhdd.wetpaint.com/page/IBM+350+RAMAC | title=CHM HDD Events: IBM 350 RAMAC | accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/20209.wss | title=IBM Details Next Generation of Storage Innovation | date=2006-09-06 | accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/IBM-Builds-on-50-Years-of-Spinning-Disk-Storage/ | title=IBM Builds on 50 Years of Spinning Disk Storage | first=Chris | last=Preimesberger | publisher=eWeek.com | date=2006-09-08 | accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref><p>
I wonder: does the one day difference in date, September 13 versus 14, result from time zone or international date line difficulties? Should this be dated in New York at the corporate headquarters and news media center, or in San Jose CA where they did the work before most readers were even born?

:Would u mind explaining why your original two point calculation of 40% was an acceptable alternative to a trend line derived from the 300+ data points in your reference when you made this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&diff=619874762&oldid=619781963#cite_ref-AutoMK-4_16-0 edit]?
:Since we are calculating various CAGRs to one decimal place for purpose of comparison, it is a good idea to use at least two on dates for such calculations.  Excel doesn't care and the rounding off to one digit is free.  Such precision has nothing to do with what dates appear in Wikipedia articles.
:One day doesn't matter in calculations using 1/100th of a year (~+/- 2 days) but [re]search on your part might have discovered the 305/650 announcement was officially released on Sept 14, 1956 but it had likely been distributed to the press at an demonstration earlier than Sept 14 resulting in at least one newspaper printing an announcement on Sept 13.  The press conference was on Sept 14.  So it is not surprising that there is some confusion in the various sources that carries through to Wikipedia articles.  Personally I think the press conference on Sept 14, 1956 is the most reliable date for RAMAC announcement in Wikipedia articles and the nominal date for CAGR calcultions.

::Why original calculation was two points and 40%: Sure, this is done to keep the paragraph consistent. If this article showed a graphic of 300 data points and its least squares slope, then this paragraph should state that slope and show that graphic. But, the paragraph lists only two endpoints for each of the following parameters between 2H1956 and 2014: capacity per HDD, physical volume of HDD, weight, price, and average access time. The two point slope is obtained from those endpoints. Price decreased from about US$15,000 per megabyte to less than $0.00006 per megabyte, a greater than 250-million-to-1 decrease. 250E6 ^ (1 / 57.3) – 1 = +40% CAGR  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 21:55, 16 August 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Wikipedia is not permitted to revise a reference or photoshop corrections. I oppose fiddling with the graphic until Whyte himself corrects the data point, and publishes the corrected graphic in an openly accessible location. If he were to “correct” the RAMAC data point all the way out to early 1959 (not early 1958), then the “corrected” slope of the 42 points would match Moore's law (doubling every two years or 41.42% per year).

:It's not so much a  discussion as a dialog of the deaf; you can help by taking a position - the IP seems to be willing to stop when two or more editors disagree with his position.  
:Using hard reliable data it can be shown that over its first fifty or so years from the 1956 [[IBM_350|RAMAC]]{{Efn|RAMAC 2.000 E-06 AD, earliest date June 1, 1956, nominal date Sep 14, 1956, early production date Jan 1, 1958}} to the [http://storage.toshiba.com/techdocs/PR2006-08-200GBPMR2.5-inchdrive.pdf 2006 Toshiba MK2035GSS]{{Efn|Toshiba 1.788 E+02 AD, late date Aug 31, 2006, nominal date Aug 15, 2006}} the areal density of HDDs increased at an annualized rate of at least 44.0%; the nominal rate was 44.2%per year an uncertainty of only a few 10<sup>th</sup> of a percent. {{Efn|The only significant uncertainty is in the date of shipment}}  This is significant in that had the areal density increased at a Moore’s law rate of 41.4% the Toshiba drive would have been introduced in 2008 or later rather than 2006.  If the earliest production RAMAC date is January 1, 1958, the worst case (lowest) rate is 45.7%. There is little uncertainty in these numbers, a few 10<sup>th</sup> of a percent.  Isn't this proof enough that over the long term HDD AD CAGR somewhat exceeded a ML growth rate? 

::No, these are just two data points and the dates are fudged. What happened to the original dates of 2009 and 1956? One cherry-picked Toshiba data point, and here the date has been moved/adjusted for no good reason from 2009 to 2006, and one heavily "date corrected" and massaged/adjusted RAMAC point (conveniently moved again, from 2H1956 to 1H1958) don't substantiate the claim that density grew faster than Moore's law. Actually, their growth was similar over five decades (2H1956-2009). It seems one editor will never stop the debate about whether growth was similar to or greater than, regardless of the facts and references that contradict his or her position. Some of those citations are as follows:

::1. For this comparison, the slope of Moore's law (whether it doubles every two years, 18 months, 27 months, etc.; whether it measures transistors, linewidths, or components, etc.) is fuzzy according to Tuomi. [[http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html The Lives and Death of Moore's Law] – By [[Ilkka Tuomi]]<br /> This is reference number one. It is 14 thousand words long. 

::2. Secondly, Plumer (2011) found that areal density grew about 40% per year over the past 50 years: “In order to achieve the approximate 40% compound areal density growth rate that the HDD industry has delivered over the past 50 years, several key technology innovations have been employed." <ref>{{cite journal

::3. Thirdly, the [[linear regression]] slope of areal density for all 42 data points from the graphic (Whyte) is 40.9% per year, similar to Moore's law. Playing/fudging/manipulating-shamelessly with the RAMAC date (1956 to 1958) won't jack this slope up much higher than 41%. This is reference number three, and this graphic was kindly added here by the Tom94022 editor.

::4. Fourth and finally, Marchon (2013) indicates that areal density grew at “the historical, Moore's law equivalent of ~40%/annum.”<ref name="Marchon2013a">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1155/2013/521086|title=The Head-Disk Interface Roadmap to an Areal Density of Tbit/in2|journal=Advances in Tribology|volume=2013|pages=1|year=2013|last1=Marchon|first1=Bruno|last2=Pitchford|first2=Thomas|last3=Hsia|first3=Yiao-Tee|last4=Gangopadhyay|first4=Sunita}}"the compound annual growth rate has reduced considerably from ~100%/annum in the late 1990s to 20–30% today.

This is reference number four.

::Therefore according to multiple credible sources, namely Tuomi, Plumer(2011), the Whyte graphic, and very particularly and specifically Marchon(2013), areal density grew at a rate similar to (“equivalent” according to Marchon et al.) Moore's law over more than five decades.

I started with, preferred and argued for a measurement to 2006 which is about the current breaking point in the curve.

:::::You apparently fail to understand [[WP:NOR]] rules.

As an added complication, the similar 355 stored data as decimal digits; a character was stored as a pair of digits, with code points from 0 to 99.

What is disclosed is that it is has a full track data organization, reading and writing 60 contiguous words of 10 digits each with a two word gap between the end of the data and its beginning, see figure 5 on page 18.  There is no track to track orientation, a read starts with the sensing of the gap while a track write operation starts at any location with writing of the gap. There is no mention of parity; it does say that as each digit is read it is checked for validity.  Now for some speculation and/or original research:
::*If as is likely it uses a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] code which in modern terms is a self checking 7 bit channel code then no parity would be required.
::*It would be possible to decimal pack 6 million decimal characters into 3 million bytes so one way to look at the capacity is it would take 3.002368 MB of modern storage using 4k sectors to store the contents of a 355.

== "A HDD" vs. "an HDD", and some barebones ==

Hey {{u|Luigi.a.cruz}}!  Just wanted to discuss latest few edits on this article, which are well summarized in {{Diff|Hard disk drive|624333432|624312589|this edit}}.  Regarding whether "a" or "an" should be used with "HDD", the decision is based on how something is pronounced, not on how that's written.  As "HDD" is pronounced as "aitch-dee-dee", thus it starts with a vowel, "an" is to be used; a good example is "an hour", as "hour" is also pronounced with opening vowel.

Regarding the "IDE-based barebone", what's the "barebone" supposed to mean in the HDD context?  When a "barebone" is mentioned to someone who deals with PCs, it usually refers to computers sold with just a motherboard, PSU and case{{snd}} but how does that make a special case for HDDs?  At the same time, for the "Past and present HDD form factors" summary table we want "cherry-picked" best samples, so there's pretty much no need to explain the size limits for various device classes.

Please advise. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 20:55, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

== An IBM 305 is not an IBM 650 ==

The discussion of the capacity of an IBM 350 connected to an IBM 305 RAMAC repeatedly conflates the 305 with the 650. They are different machines, with different data representations.

The IBM 650 had signed 10 digit words, with each digit represented in [[Bi-quinary coded decimal|bi-quinary]], and represented character data as pairs of decimal digits. The 305 represented characters as 6 bits plus parity. In both cases the character coding used was influenced by the coding on the [[Punched card|Hollerith card]]. Similarly, the formatted capacity of the 350 disk is not in the same units as the formatted capacity of the 355; the first is in characters (six bits plus parity) while the second is in signed 10-digit words. The relevant manuals are all available at [http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/305_ramac/ http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/305_ramac/] and [http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/650/ http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/650/]. [[User:Chatul|Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul]] ([[User talk:Chatul|talk]]) 23:44, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

== Bad source? ==

The reference to the size and capacity of the IBM 350 ([https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/DataCenter7/entry/ibm_impact_on_storage?lang=en here]) actually references Wikipedia itself. Surely this can't be used as a reliable source. --[[User:Lewis Hulbert|Lewis Hulbert]] ([[User talk:Lewis Hulbert|talk]]) 14:46, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

== RAMAC Price and Ratio ==

The IP reverted a change with the comment,
{{quotebox|quote=[[WP:Verifiability]] "Do not use articles from Wikipedia as sources." Must provide an underlying source (reference). 180 million still has false precision; $0.05 corresponds to 200 million.)|align=center|width=70%

Actually the RAMAC price/$MB (a routine calculation) has its two components properly referenced on the cited page so it is indirectly referenced meeting the verifiability requirement, which I believe the IP knows, and according the [[WP:Verifiability]] the IP should have fixed the reference rather than blowing it away with a tag.

I really don't understand the "false precision" comment, it seems to me that mathematically 9200/<0.05 == >184 million which properly rounds to >180 and not >200.  Perhaps a better way to look at it is if 
:.045 < current price < 0.50 then, 
:184 million < Ramac prioe/current price < 204 million 
so to say that the ratio is >200 million as proposed by the IP is misleading at best.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 17:52, 26 August 2014 (UTC)

From the same BRL data cited by the IP it seems the the 355 Model 1 had a purchase price of $62,200; with a capacity of 6 million characters (5 bit) it's capacity was also 3.75 MB resulting in a price of $16,587/MB.

Wikipedia values [[wp:verifiabililty]], and this tedious defense of $9,200 is bereft of any reference. Apparently the editor can't find direct support for $9,200. No source, beside one Wikipedia editor, ever said $9,200. This is all [[wp:or]] original research; it midleadingly focuses on the RAMAC305 and ignores the contemporaneous RAMAC650_355; and it is laden with [[false precision]]. 

Here's another source that is not a calculation and not original research which gives a RAMAC price of [http://www.dayintechhistory.com/dith/october-29-1955-reynold-johnson-ramac-hard-drive-prototype-ibm/ $10,000/MB]. Both RAMAC350 and RAMAC355 were introduced simultaneously in 1956 and withdrawn simultaneously in [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_355.html 1969]. As of the late 1950s the 650 computer with RAMAC355 storage was produced at the rate of one per day in higher volume, nearly 2000 units, than any other computer in history up to that time.<ref>[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/650/650_intro.html IBM Archives - IBM 650]</ref> We could agree that the RAMAC355 price was higher than the RAMAC350. One dubious editor-produced calculation puts it 65% higher ($15,200 versus $9,200 per disputed MB), and a more rational and reasonable calculation has it 25% higher (($975 / 6 million characters * 5 million characters) per month versus $650 per month). Either way, the 355 price was indeed higher, and these two models were [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_355.html contemporaneous] according to IBM. This means the real, true price must have been substantially higher than $9,200. More like $10,000 with one significant digit of precision.

Again, no reference supports the entirely editor-fabricated claim that the 355 was produced later than (not contemporaneous with) the 350. So, the $9,200 price is still dubious, misleadingly over-precise, ignores the higher-volume and contemporaneous 355, and unsupported by any reference. The real, verifable, properly supported, not falsely precise, price is $10,000. [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 23:49, 31 August 2014 (UTC)

:I really hate to repeat myself, but there is nothing in [[WP:V|Wikipedia's Policy on Verifiablity]] that precludes an editor performing a [[WP:CALC|routine calculation]] which can then be used in an article; the IP is simply making up a prohibition.  The IP has previously edited CAGR calculations into an article so it is rather dishonest of him to deny the validity of routine division yielding $9,200, particularly since both the numerator and the denominator have reliable sources.

:The IP again cites an unreliable source since the price/MB therein is based upon an incorrect 5 MB capacity.

:The IP asserts the character size of the M350 is the same as that of the M355 without any evidence what so ever, but is then willing to perform a routine calculation in support of his position.  BTW, it maybe true, I don't think so, but it is irrelevant to this duologue. 

:The IP is deliberately misleading when he characterizes the 350 and the 355 as contemporaneous; they were announced simultaneously in a press release on Sept 14, 1956<ref name="IBM650PR">[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/650/650_pr2.html Text of an IBM press release distributed on September 14, 1956]</ref>, but at that time there were at least two 350s installed (Zellerbach and USN Norfolk<ref name="IBM650PR" /) and several more were promised for delivery in 1950 (Fourteen in all were to be built in 1956 and 1957 before production commenced and we have reliable sources for 2 installations), the 350 production date was announced and the actual beginning of production has been confirmed.  By way of contrast, the 355 had not shipped on Sept 14, 1956, and while production was estimated for mid-1957 so far the IP, who demands [[WP:V| verifiablility]] has produced no evidence of the date of actual shipment of a 355, it may have been 1958 or later.  So in 1956 there was only the 350.  The IP further misleads by citing the total volume of the 650 System without informing us that the 650 system shipped long before the RAMAC 350 and was always available without the 355 disk file.  So there is simply no way for him to estimate the "average" price to any degree of precision.
::Note that over 1000 305 systems were shipped thru 1961<ref>[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html IBM 350 disk storage unit]</ref>, each one having at least one 350; some having 2.  According to Phister the number of first generation disk drives installed on all IBM systems in 1961 was 900 units leaving very little room for 355s on 650s.  A low number of disks on M650s is supported by a 1962 survey of educational computing<ref>"Computing In The Universty," American Mathematical Society and the Ohio State Research Center, Datamation, May 1962</ref> that identified only 2 RAMAC units out of 38 installed M650s.  It seems the M355 is yet another [[red herring]] by the IP to justify his position, which u should recall proposed $10,000/MB without any reference to M355 at all. 

:There is no false precision in $9,200 since the prices of the various models are known to 5 digits, the capacity is an integer and the 350 was the only product shipping in 1956.  What the IP is asserting is a [[false equivalence]] between several inconsistent unreliable sources and this routine calculation.

:::Thank you for acknowledging BRL as a reliable source.
:::The ESCO citation for the IBM 355 date is ambiguous in that ESCO reported two IBM 650 systems, Number 800 having 4 IBM 355s and Number 700 without any disk drives.  The acceptance test date does not say what was accepted in 1957, it could have been one or both.
:::There is good evidence that the IBM 355 character was a 5 bit decimal digit and not a 6 bit alphanumeric digit<ref>Pugh, IBM's Early Computers, p658 fn55, "Because of 650's encoding conventions, 355 capacity was 6 million decimal digits."</ref>.  The IP has presented no evidence that the character size of the two RAMACs was the same so any ratio is suspect.  But since he is willing to do such ratio calculations I fail to understand any objection to $34,500/3.75.

=== End of one part of the duologue ===
IBM's archivist has provided me with a copy of IBM Announcement Letter 259-38, May 5, 1958, announcing the "IBM 350 Disk Storage Model 2", "similar to the Model 1" to be installed as a second disk file on the 305 system with a rental price of "$700/month" and a purchase price of "$36,400".  Initial deliveries were scheduled to begin "September 1958."  Note that there is one M350 in the BRL survey at $700/Month, presumably a Model 2; the others have rental of $650/month and one has a purchase price of $34,500.  This clearly establishes the BRL as a reliable source for the purchase price of the 350 Model 1 as $34,500 and confirms as unreliable the sources using $50,000 for the purchase price of the original RAMAC, Model 1 or 2.  If the IP insists otherwise I suppose I will have to find a way to post it but I would hope he/she would attribute [[good faith]] on my part and stop wasting time on this issue.

==== Argument by IP against current edit ====
Capacity (based on 6 bit characters) is absolutely disputable. Respected sources say 7 non-binary bits, not 6 binary bits per character and 3.75 MB capacity. The Official History of IBM hails the RAMAC350 as an Icon of Progress, “The whole thing could store 5 million binary decimal encoded characters at 7 bits per character.” That might be 5 million characters (7 bits / 8 bits per modern byte) or around 4.4 million megabytes.[[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ramac/]] Al Shugart himself is quoted directly saying it had a 7 bit code, “The coding used on the disk drive was a 7-bit code - 6-bit + 1 binary. Very straightforward and simple.”[[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2014/07/102739924-05-02-acc.pdf]] The American Society of Mechanical Engineers designated RAMAC as An International Historic Landmark, noting it had 7 non-binary bits per character: “The 350’s … contained a total capacity of 5 million binary decimal encoded characters (7 bits per character) of storage.”[[https://www.asme.org/getmedia/17666e1b-8c69-4028-9227-b6d04ca4375e/90-IBM-350-RAMAC-Disk-File.aspx]] RAMAC355 likewise had 7 bits per character because it “used the same mechanism as the IBM 350 and stored 6 million 7-bit decimal digits.”[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_355]], 20% more than the RAMAC350. Again according to wikipedia, “each character was 7 bits, composed of two zone bits ("X" and "O"), four BCD bits for the value of the digit, and an odd parity bit ("R") in the following format: X O 8 4 2 1 R”[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_305_RAMAC]] To recap, sources supporting a non-binary version of 7 bits not the 6 binary bits that are tied to 3.75 MB include the Official History of IBM, a direct quote from Al Shugart himself and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Historic Landmark designation. Certainly, the non-binary code would carry more than 6 binary bits of information, hence more than 3.75 MB, because four BCD bits take more space than binary bits: "Standard BCD requires four bits per digit, roughly 20 percent more space than a binary encoding (the ratio of 4 bits to log210 bits is 1.204)."[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal]] [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 20:33, 4 September 2014 (UTC)

:: Agreed - specifically, see page 70 in the above-referenced PDF. And note that it is explicitly talking about the data format "on the drum or disk", so there is no arguing that it's the 305's internal format and the format on disk could be different.

==== Correct price is $10,000 per Megabyte ====
No editor-calculated original research [[WP:OR]] is justified here since direct sources are available.  Here's one direct source[[http://sctv.kurikulum.org/_lain.php?_lain=19249#cite_note-autogenerated2-18]] that gives a RAMAC350 a price/megabyte of (US$)15,200. So, we've numerous reports, not editor calculations. They present an obstacle for the tendentious and calculating editor because none of the sources say precisely $9,200/MB nor 3.75 MB nor 6 binary bits per character.

Respected sources say 7 non-binary bits, not 6 binary bits per character and 3.75 MB capacity. The Official History of IBM hails the RAMAC350 as an Icon of Progress, “The whole thing could store 5 million binary decimal encoded characters at 7 bits per character.” That might be 5 million characters (7 bits / 8 bits per modern byte) or around 4.4 million megabytes.[[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ramac/]] Al Shugart himself is quoted directly saying it had a 7 bit code, “The coding used on the disk drive was a 7-bit code - 6-bit + 1 binary.

So, the problems that produce over-precision in the editor's $9,200 calculation are model selection (350 or 355, which were contemporaneous and priced differently), capacity (6 binary bits or 7 non-binary bits per character) and price (various sources offer different price/MB). All direct sources, and the dubious over-precise $9,200 editor calculation, agree that RAMAC “at the start” cost $10,000/MB with one significant digit of precision.

(Moved IP comment here for better flow)
Questioning and civil discussion is the first step on the path to wisdom. Thanks for the opportunity to summarize the (correct) answers to the questions you've posed:

1. The capacity of the 350 Disk File is "other" (nearly 4.4 MB), because BCD encoding is not precisely 6.000 bits (more nearly 7 bits) per character. 

2. The purchase price was $34,500 according to BRL, and the contemporaneous RAMAC355 was 50% higher (with 20% greater capacity as well). No, price/MB is not a routine calculation. Here the editor posing these questions selects a biased model type (350) and ignores the contemporaneous higher-priced RAMAC355. Any calculation is unneeded and inappropriate original research [[WP:OR]] on the part of the wikipedia editor because several reliable sources are available that directly give price/MB. 

3. The premise of your question (agreement that price is a routine calculation) is wrong. We can calculate the ratio here, without undertaking an editor calculation of the price or agreeing to your premise. The ratio is > 200 million to one. ($10,000 per megabyte versus < $0.05 per gigabyte). [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 20:28, 4 September 2014 (UTC)

=== An End To The RAMAC Price Duologue ===
With an apparent acceptance that the 350 Disk File (Model 1) had a purchase price of $34,500, may I now suggest that this duologue can be ended by allowing other editors to discuss the following three questions, perhaps referring to the summaries immediately above.

# Capacity '''3.75MB'''.  In what we call "capacity" today, it includes user data only, and excludes all parity, ECC, servo and metadata.  This was not the case in the early days; in the 1990s I worked on drives that reported the larger "unformatted" capacity (lawyers made us stop doing that).  For any comparison, we must do some conversion between the old and new uses of the term capacity.  I can conceive of no other way that to use data (non-parity) bits; (modern drives have much larger ratios of non-data to data capacity).  That means the parity bit for each 6 bits should not be counted.  This is suitably sourced. Al Shugart's comments support the "+1" as not being data.  5 million times 6 bits = 3.75MB (8-bit). BTW, introducing BCD into this mix would ''reduce'' the capacity, as 4 BCD bits only allows for values of 0-9, not 0-15 as allowed by 4 binary bits, but evaluating the impact of BCD on capacity isn't sourced.  (Also, BCD values of 10-15 ''could'' be reserved for "special conditions" not defined by the storage itself.)
# Yes; '''$34,500/3.75MB''' calculation is okay to include ($9200/MB).  This is allowed per [[WP:CALC]] and does not violate [[WP:SYNTH]].

* I agree with 3.75&nbsp;MB. To pull this off, we must compare apples to apples. Common sense must prevail. On with building Wikipedia. BTW, I would suggest a non-breaking space (<code><nowiki>&amp;nbsp;</nowiki></code>) between the value and the unit of measure. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 03:01, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

* I'm not commenting on the pricing, but I do agree that the storage was 3,750,000 bytes.  To allow correct comparison with modern capacity measures, one should not include meta-bits like parity and stop bits.  I'd only change my mind if it was possible to turn off the parity check and use the 7th bit for data, but nobody has produced evidence of that.  Incidentally, I'm pretty sure that in those days 3,750,000 bytes was 3.58 MB since "MB" meant 2<sup>20</sub> bytes, but I'm not suggesting to use that.

*I have no knowledge of the drive under discussion but I agree that early systems gave their capacity in terms of every bit on the platter, not just user data. Perhaps replace US$9,200 with "Over US$9,000" and leave the 180-million-to-one. The footnote should give a very brief explanation per the above summary. The IP will never be satisfied and the formal procedure would be to start an RfC. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 03:54, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

* Consensus is clear enough There is no need to wiki-red-tape any further over such a minor point when the answer was so obvious. [[User:Greg L|Greg L]] ([[User talk:Greg L|talk]]) 04:28, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

* For the beginning, here are a few quotes:
** From page eight of the [http://www.ed-thelen.org/RAMAC/IBM-227-3534-0-305-RAMAC-r.pdf RAMAC 305 manual]:
::: Within RAMAC, all data is read, transferred, and written serially by word, character, and bit.  There are eight bit positions within each character position.  They are identitified as bits S, X, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and R.  Bit S merely provides a spave between the recording bit positions of each character, and is not used in the bit coding.  Bit R has no numeric or alphabetic value, but is added to certain characters so that every character will have an odd numer of bits.  This convention makes possible a technique whereby RAMAC may perform a validity check on each character transferred.
:* From page one of [http://www.computerhistory.org/groups/storagesig/media/docs/ibm_350_ramac.pdf this PDF file]:
::: The disk drive could store 5 million characters using a 6-bit character code plus a parity and space bit per character.
:* From page 14 of the [http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5573.pdf Historic Landmark paper]:
::: The 350's fifty 24-inch disks contained a total capacity of 5 million binary decimal encoded characters (7 bits per character) of storage.
: Based on the first quote, each RAMAC's byte had six end-user-accessible bits, as we have to discard space that's unusable to end users; for RAMAC, those are space and parity bits in each "platter" byte.  As a note, modern HDDs also contain quite a lot of space that isn't accessible to end users, while only the usable amount of space is advertised; one of the motivations behind the 4Kn initiative is the reduction of "wasted" platter space associated to ECC data, and ECC data is only one part of the end-user-inaccessible space.  For example, a typical 1&nbsp;TB HDD with 512-byte sectors also provides additional capacity of about 93&nbsp;GB for the ECC data; see [http://www.idema.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/12/AF-in-Legacy-Infrastructures-SDC2011_IDEMA-AF.pdf this PDF] and [[:File:Afdia1.jpg|this illustration]] for more information.
: The third quote might be a bit contradictory, but each character is actually written to platters as seven bits, out of which only six bits are accessible to end users as the seventh ("R") bit is the parity bit used by RAMAC; eighth ("S") bit is practically empty space.  This is probably a small marketing trick.
: Based on all that, RAMAC has 5,000,000 characters with six bits each, what's 30,000,000 bits or 3,750,000 bytes.  As the "1&nbsp;MB&nbsp;= 1,000,000&nbsp;bytes" marketing gimmick applies to modern HDDs, we have to apply it to RAMAC, too, thus we end up with '''3.75&nbsp;MB''' as the RAMAC's capacity that can be used for later comparisons.  $34,500&nbsp;/ 3.75 is the logical calculation for price per MB, what results in '''$9,200''' per RAMAC's MB of storage.  When that is compared to less than $0.05 per MB, we end up with a somewhat larger than '''184,000-to-one''' ratio{{snd}} how is the 180,000,000-to-one ratio calculated? &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 05:00, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

:IBM used the term '''BCD''' to refer to a six bit character set in which the digits 0-9 were encoded as 000000 through 001001; the term does not mean that the value of the right four bits is restricted to that range for other characters.

Perhaps one reason for this question being so hard to settle is that there are good arguments for all the options:

* 3.75MB If one tried to store a .jpg file on an IBM 305 RAMAC there would only be room for a 3.75MB file.

*4.375MB The IBM 350 drive stored seven bit bytes. The decision to allocate one bit to parity is arguably a system design decision, not a disk drive limitation. If we had a working 350 and wanted to interface it to, say, a Raspberry Pi, one could easily put the interface upstream of the parity circuitry and store 4.375MB worth of .jpg files. 

*5MB  Nobody was storing images on computers in 1956. IBM 350 disk drives were used for storing numbers and characters and if we ran the same software today, say with a 305 emulator on a PC, we would store  one character per modern byte. So an IBM 350 used in the normal way it was used then would be as useful as a 5 MB modern disk drive used the same way.

In the table in question we are reporting economic utility improvement ratios, and those ratios calculated in any of the ways mentioned are extremely large, almost incomprehensible, perhaps the most dramatic in human history. So my inclination would be to report them in the most conservative way, which would calculate the ratios on the basis that one character on the 350 is the economic equivalent of one 8-bit byte on a modern drive. So e.g. for "Starting with", I would say "5 megacharacters." However, I would then put a footnote at the bottom of the table, that said something like:

:“* These ratios assume that one six-bit character on the IBM 350 is equivalent to one eight-bit byte on a modern disk drive. Comparing on a cost per bit basis, one should increase these ratios by a factor of 1.14 or 1.33 depending on whether one includes the seventh parity bit or not.”

In other words, here is a big number and arguably it could be even bigger.

As for rounding, again I would also be conservative and never round up. 180,000,000 is not excessive precision here.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 20:58, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

::I disagree.  There's no useful way to compare these so-called "megacharacters" to bytes.  It's true there are use clashes in this, but unless we just forget about doing any comparision, we can only use the lowest common denominator -- data bits.  Since RAMAC had a designated parity bit, I can only assume it wasn't sufficiently reliable without it.  On a modern HDD, I can ''attempt'' to use Write-Long and Read-long commands to store extra data in the ECC field to a higher capacity, but I'd never be able to usefully retrieve the data I stored, so it can't count as storage capacity.  Also, even if we try and get "smarter" about use, this would be countered by it's BCD focus that reduces effective capacity.  But most importantly, by attempting this smarter use-case conversion, we'd now need a source that supports this, or we violate [[WP:SYNTH]].  --[[User:A D Monroe III|A D Monroe III]] ([[User talk:A D Monroe III|talk]]) 22:50, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

::: There is much confusion here over "BCD". IBM referred to their six-bit character code (which included almost 64 printable characters) as "binary-coded decimal". Their use of this term does not mean that only decimal digits were stored, so there is no "BCD focus that reduces effective capacity". The "zone bits" correspond to the 12- and 11-zone punches on the IBM punch card. See the character code table in the [[IBM 1401]] article.

::: Hm, then maybe we can go with 3.75&nbsp;MB and briefly describe how it was calculated in a note?  I also don't count parity bits as something that should be used to store user-accessible data.  Also, as Jeh already described, IBM practically misused BCD as a term (at least as we know it), as both letters and numbers were stored on RAMAC.  Why would only numbers be stored?  At least you can't sell something that can store only numbers to someone who wants to run a business with that thing. :) &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 23:24, 5 September 2014 (UTC)

:::: My take: The parity bit should not get counted in usable capacity any more than do the CRC bits on a modern hard drive, or the parity stripes in a RAID array for that matter. So it is 5 million x 6 bits = 30 million bits. There are defensible arguments for calling this 3.75 million bytes. To refer to it as "five million characters" without explanation that these "characters" had only 64 possible values, not 256, is to invite a misunderstanding that the drive had the same usable capacity as a 5 MB Shugart drive, when, of course, it did not.

I don't agree that bit count is the only common denominator for comparison. Addressable characters was arguably as important a metric. The 305 processed characters which back then came almost exclusively from punch cards, and their coding in 1956 did not require more than 64 bits.  If one concocted a science fiction plot where one had to go back and fix an IBM 305 with a minimal modern drive, a 3.75 MB drive would not do while that 5 MB Shugart would work just fine. As for "I can only assume it wasn't sufficiently reliable without it" {the parity bit}, there is no reason to assume that. To begin with, the parity bit did not improve reliability. It only told you that a failure occurred. What were you supposed to do then? Stop processing, figure out what track was bad, find the original data and reload it? If the data on the drive was the result of several updates, that would be extremely tedious if not impossible. (Transaction logging was well into the future.) So if parity failures had occurred with any significant frequency, the drives would have been unusable. Also, I can't find any reference in any of the documents that the IBM 650 version of the drive, the 355, used a parity check. An alternate explanation for the parity bit is IBM's need to convince customers that it was safe to switch from punch card storage of their data, something customers had decades of experience with, to magnetic media. Note that the 6 bit BCD with parity format is exactly the same as IBM's 7-track tape format.  The obvious solution for our article is to make clear the different comparison approaches.  All I am suggesting is that when computing the huge improvement in drive capacity per dollar, a gigantic number, that we start with the most conservative number and then point out ratio is up to 33% bigger if one just looks at bits.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 21:41, 7 September 2014 (UTC)

:  Hm, if it's about replacing a RAMAC with the smallest possible modern HDD, there are no reasons not to create a translation layer that would map 6-bit "words" (or bytes) onto standard 8-bit "words" with no wasted bits; that way, 3.75&nbsp;MB would still be enough as we can ditch parity bits and leave that to modern HDD's ECC functionality.  Also, parity checks aren't usable for restoring corrupted data, for sure, but that at least made it possible to know that something was wrong with a RAMAC, and possibly repair it (I guess). &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 22:04, 7 September 2014 (UTC)

: Arnold, a parity check certainly ''does'' improve reliability.  A lot of read errors are ephemeral (electronic noise, physical vibration, etc), so the first step on getting the error is to try the read again. The chance of eventually getting the correct data off the disk is significantly greater than if there was no check.  Maybe this was even done automatically by the device controller as all modern disk controllers do (do we have the documentation to determine that?). Another way that parity checks enhance reliability is that users can keep two copies of critical files and know which is correct if one gets a parity error.

::FWIW, this is how IBM describes the characters of a 305 and the 350:
{{quotebox
|quote=Within RAMAC, all data is read, transferred, and written serially by word. character, and bit. There are eight bit positions within each character position. They are identified as bits S, X. 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and R. Bit S merely provides a space between the recording bit positions of each character, and is not used in the bit coding. Bit R has no numeric or alphabetic value, but is added to certain characters so that every character will have an odd number of bits. This convention makes possible a technique whereby RAMAC may perform a validity check on each character transferred.<br/> See also Figure 86. for File [i.e. 350] Write and Read Waveforms.

::::A closer read of the IBM 305 documentation make it clear that IBM was not doing any automatic error recovery on the 305. Also the 305 only had room for 200 instructions total, so keeping live backups was unlikely (and they would have cut the capacity of the system in half).  The 6-bit plus parity bit encoding was used throughout the 305 and any parity failure halted the machine. The 350 disk drive just transferred the 7-bit data from and to the CPU's 100-character magnetic-core data buffer. The IBM 305 operation manual says (Ref 4, p.72) "Each character that enters or leaves the magnetic-core unit is checked to insure that it contains an odd number of bits. Because all information transfers (except certain arithmetic operational transfers) take place through the magnetic-core unit, the machine will recognize an error whenever an inadmissible character is transferred. Any combination of bits that give an even count will stop the machine and turn on the parity check light."  

::::The IBM 350 disk system instead achieved reliability with a read and compare after write system. "The file check is a check on the recording of information on the disks. Whenever a record is written in the disk storage, the machine automatically rereads the same record into the core unit. Then the record is read back from the disk storage track and compared, character by character, with the re-reading of the record in the magnetic-core unit. A difference in comparison causes the file error light to be turned on and stops the machine." (p.73) The operator could try the write operation again manually: "The operator may attempt the transfer again by depressing the check reset key and then the program start key." Note that this file check approach does not depend on the parity bit. So it would seem that the IBM 350 drive was a reliable mechanism for storing 7-bit data, hooked to a CPU that then used one of those bits for additional error checking. 

::::Again, I am not saying any one basis for comparison is the right answer, just that there is a good argument for each, and when computing the massive multiple in cost improvement from 1956 to now we should start with the most conservative number. I would also point out that the difference between using 5, 4.375 or 3.75 meg as the comparison point probably presents less variation than there is in establishing "current" disk prices.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 03:43, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

:::::A block of data usable by a system at the bit stream level (the 350 interface and most interfaces into the 1990s) consists of a stream of serial gap bits, followed by a stream of encoded data bits, followed by a stream of check (and now correction) bits{{Efn|Sometimes as in CDs the check bits are interspersed with the encoded data bits, mostly they are not.}}  Today there are always many more encoded data bits than system usable bits; however block capacity is always stated in (system usable bits)/8 and drive capacity is then in multiples of these blocks and rounded at MB thru TB as appropriate.  We don't know why the designers of the 350 recording channel chose to intersperse some of their gap bits, S, and their check bits, R, within their encoded data bits{{Efn|Probably because electronics were very expensive then compared to media}} but it really shouldn't matter since gap and check bits have never been counted to measure capacity available to a system.  Since the 350 data bits are not encoded, the 350 sector has precisely 600 data bits per sector available to the system.  Seventy five bytes per sector in today's terms, no more, no less.

:::::I'm not sure how the bits (bytes/8) are character encoded matters.  Sectors read lately off the 350 at the Computer History Museum are likely stored as Unicode (implying a 10 MB current replacement capacity) and since disk storage is free the sectors themselves maybe stored in 4k sectors (implying a 204.8 MB current replacement capacity) but the entire contents of the museum's 350 will fit into precisely 3.7504 MB of modern storage (7,325 512 byte sectors) or maybe 3.751836 MB (4k sectors) either rounding to 3.75 MB.  Capacity required currently for replacement under various other coding schemes is interesting and might be worth discussing someplace but does it make sense in this summary table?

:::::Read after write was easy in tape but very difficult in disk and it gradually disappeared as disk drives got more reliable.{{Efn|I think the addition of the count field (sector header) was the first step followed by internal write circuit checks and head checks (causing far more false positives that actual failure detection).}}  Regardless, the 350 recording channel engineers achieved their targeted channel reliability and how it was achieved really shouldn't matter in determining capacity.  BTW from a recording channel error rate the 350 was probably better than today's drives at a soft error rate (say 10<sup>-9</sup> vs. 10<sup>-6</sup>) but worse at hard error rate (say 10<sup>-11</sup> vs. 10<sup>-14</sup>).  Overall reliability improvement is also about 3 orders of magnitude (and more if u count RAID) but isn't that a different parameter from capacity?

Arnold, I am not sure what u meant by "addressable characters" and how that can be used to normalize capacity.  FWIW the 305/350 only had 48 characters (including "blank") whose code map looks nothing like ASCII or anything modern, e.g "1" is 01H in 350 vs 60H in ASCII, "A" is 03H vs 41H, etc.  There is a mysterious to me 350 symbol "□" with bit code 27H which may not exist in ASCII although certainly 27H is a byte.  Storage is character agnostic, there would have to be a translation layer from a modern byte to the 305/350 bit code and that translation layer would equally work with packed 305/350 characters as well as unpacked characters.  So yes in our science fiction plot a 3.75 MB HDD would store the entire contents of a 350 in a packed format and perform well as a 350 emulator (keep in mind the 350 read and wrote 600 data bits per block while a modern disk drive reads and writes 4096 or 32,768 bits per block so the fictional emulator has to do lots of parsing in its translation layer).  If u meant addressable disk storage locations in a 350 then we all agree it is 5 million, but I don't see how the mapping of the bit values to characters is relevant to normalizing.  Its the size of the location that counts, we state RAM size in bytes regardless of whether they are accessed in 32, 64 or 128 byte chunks.  Isn't the size of the storage location in bits the best analogy?  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 05:54, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

:Tom, here is the addressable character argument. The ratio we are arguing about is an economic one, and economic comparisons between different eras are typically done based on the normal practices in each era. The normal practice these days is to store one character per octet. If we were converting a 305 system to modern technology we’d just convert to ASCII or UTF-8. (BTW that mysterious 350 symbol "□" with bit code 27H was called [[lozenge]] and has a code point in Unicode.) As of a couple of years ago there was a company in Texas that still used punched card inventory control with IBM 402 accounting machines. When they eventually cut over they will undoubtedly convert their punched card records to octets on a one for one basis (unless they go to Microsoft software which uses UTF-16 in which case they’ll need 2 octets per character). The character conversion needed is just a 48 character lookup table, much less complex than the the translation layer you posit (try designing an 8-bit to 6-bit converter in 1956 vacuum tube logic). Note that ASCII is a 7-bit code, and it is hardly common practice to use such a translation layer. So that 5 mega-character drive back in 1957 arguably was providing the same economic benefit as a 5 megabyte drive would today. 
::I agree with u that an economic analysis is one way to look at it; however, I conclude such an analysis arrives at 3.75 MB as the appropriate capacity.  Storage is character agnostic and arguably today it takes two octets per character.  All drives today are bit serial just like the 350. There is not necessarily a table look up in either scheme if the characters were stored in their native bit form either 6 bits/char or 8 bits/char.  In either scheme the hypothetical controller would have to generate sector marks, insert a leading gap since the first character cannot start at the sector mark and strip the 600 or 800 bits out of a longer bit stream.  The 6 bit/char version would have to generate parity and insert the blank a rather trivial operation with today's microcontrollers.  If for some reason the controller designer wanted to store the characters in today's unicode then it would require 10MB (thanks to the [[lozenge]]) and require a complex table look up - altogether not a likely implementation. So any modern drive greater than 3.75 MB would provide the same economic value and since we are talking economics shouldn't we go with the lowest value?

:The question of seven bits vs six bits depends on where you draw the line between the 350 disk drive and the 305 processor.  Remember, the disk drive units themselves neither generated nor checked parity bits. That was done in the CPU’s core memory buffer, which was used for multiple functions besides interfacing to the disk drive. There is no reason to think the parity bit was included just to look for disk errors; remember this was a vacuum tube machine and tubes failed regularly. So it’s perfectly reasonable to describe the 350 as a 7-bit disk drive hooked up to a computer that operated on 7-bit bytes that include 6 data bits and one parity bit. That is the view taken by several reliable sources and it is not objectively wrong. It also fits with essentially the same disk drive being used with the IBM 650 to store 7-bit decimal numbers in bi-quinary format. if some museum succeeded in restoring a 350, it could be used to store 7-bit data directly. That’s not to say the six bit view is wrong either, reliable sources take that view as well, and the article can and should present all three viewpoints.
::I don't know of any disk drive recording channel ever that did not include some form of error checking, parity, CRC and/or ECC.  You really have no basis for expecting a restored 350 to reliably store 7 bit data directly.  An imperfect analogy is the RLL versions of the ST506; by changing from MFM to RLL it would record 50% more data, but not reliably (as many hackers found out).  This is [[WP:OR]] and unconvincing to this old recording channel engineer.
::The line drawn is at the interface which at the data interface is essentially the same for all drives into the 1990s, that is bit serial data.  The seminal ST506 has a bit serial data interface with a generally accepted specified capacity of 5 MB but in fact the raw capacity is up to 6.2 MB with the difference represented in check bits and gap bits none of which are counted in the ST506 specified capacity and should not be counted in converting the 350.  A very reliable source, IBM, tells us that the S bit is always zero and that the R bit "has no numeric or alphabetic value."  In memory and storage capacity specifications parity or ECC bits are not included in specified capacity - think SDRAM with ECC, DRAM with parity, any disk drive (including the 350 as described by IBM as 5 million 6 bit characters, not 8 bit characters) so without explanation any calculation using 7 bits is a mathematical error which should not be reproduced in Wikipedia.
::I find it interesting that the 7 bit advocates ignore the 8th bit.  IBM describes the 350 as a 5 million character machine have an 8 bit recorded character.  Why is the P bit counted but the S bit not counted?  Both are there, neither contributes to the character definition.  My guess is that 7 bits is an urban legend generated by someone who didn't read the book.  In any event, an advocate of seven bits is not accurately describing the 350 and this is another reason to say any such calculation is factually inaccurate and not suitable for Wikipedia.

:When we calculate a comparison between the 350 and modern drives, we are pushing the OR boundary and it is reasonable to start with the most conservative view and then point out the number could be higher if calculated in different but reasonable ways. And we haven’t even gotten to putting in the effects of inflation.

:As for the 305’s ability to operate on binary data, that is a story in itself. The 305 could only add and subtract. It did all its compare and testing operations via its plugboard control panel, where everything was done in punch card code using relay logic. The two high order data bits corresponded to the 12 and 11 rows on a card and those could be tested individually. The low order four bits were converted into the digits 0 to 9, so they could not be tested directly.  

:Anyway Tom, I am not saying that your way of looking at this is wrong, just that there are other reliably sourced ways that have a reasonable basis and we should present them all. —[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 14:52, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

::I've designed, known and/or used many memory and storage devices over the years and I cannot think of a single memory or storage device where the specified capacity included check or gap bits.  Word lengths do differ but even when they I can't think of a single modern case where the specified capacity was not expressed in the common language of bytes (with binary or decimal prefixes).  For example, the DEC PDP10 used a 36 bit word but it's disk drives were specified in both words and bytes (ignoring gap and check bits) converting on a bit basis.  Similarly a 2GB SDRAM has 2GiB regardless of whether the physical interface is 32, 64 or 128 bits and independent of the number of bits used for checking.  Finally, a 750GB HDD provides 750 GB of user data whether it is bit serial (SATA) or word serial (PATA) and regardless of the number of spare, check and gap bits.  It's tough to prove a negative, but we have a whole bunch of history that suggests parity and gap bits do not count in specifying storage capacity and no reliable source that says why they should be.

::I am saying that 4.4 MB is factually incorrect by a number of tests and cannot not be used.

:::::No, a drive storing 8 bit bytes in blocks of 512 or 4096 bytes has its capacity measured in bytes.  How many 7 bit characters it stores is another question and depends upon implementation.  One way is to throw away one bit per byte and map 1 character into 1 byte; the drive capacity in MB is unchanged but the capacity in characters is the same number <strike>7/8<sup>th</sup> that</strike>.  An other way is to compact strings of 7 bit characters into the standard size blocks, so a 4096 byte block stores 4,681 characters with a negligible loss of .003% so that the capacity in characters is essentially 8/7<sup>th</sup> that in bytes - the capacity in bytes is unchanged.  To make it a 7 bit drive one would have to store an integer number of 7 bit characters per block.

{{od}}
'''In summary of where we might be at'''
:'''3.75 MB''' has reliable sources and is factually accurate.  I believe all except maybe the IP agree.
:'''4.4 MB'''
::I contend that although there are several sources for this number it is factually inaccurate, as follows:
:::IBM states a 350 character is recorded as 8 bits of which 6 are data bits (source: contemporaneous IBM CE Manual)
:::IBM discloses the 305 has a set of 48 characters mapping into 6 data bits (source: contemporaneous IBM Programming Manual)
:::Information theory confirms that 48 characters map into 6 data bits.  (no source right now, but can this be disputed)
:::One data byte as used in storage capacity specification has 8 data bits. (no source right now, but can this be disputed)
::It is factually inaccurate to equate one 350 character to 7 data bits.  While there are multiple sources that make this equivalence none explain their reasoning.  All of these sources are much later than the contemporaneous IBM documents and none state their source for 7 bits.  Accordingly the use of 7 bits must be considered factually inaccurate and any calculation based thereupon must be excluded according to Wikipedia policy.
:'''5.0 MB'''
::I agree that if the 305 characters are mapped as recorded (8 bits) into a modern drive drive it would require 5 MB.  Unfortunately I cannot find a reliable source that says this. Everyone I've looked at just makes an explicit statement, many just say "The HDD weighed over a ton and stored 5 MB of data"  (31,100 hits)
I suggest that both 4.4 and 5.0 have reached the point of urban legends, repeated without verifying the underlying facts.  Nonetheless,
I can accept going with 3.75 and $9,200 in the table with a footnote that reads something like:
:::"Other equivalent capacities have been reported such as 5.0 MB which corresponds to a one-to-one mapping of the recorded 350 character bits into a byte. Using 5.0 MB would reduce the price/MB from $9,200 to $6,900."
This assumes the 31,100 hits did do their due diligence, otherwise it might be OR :-) [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 19:06, 12 September 2014 (UTC)

:Per your first sentence, I think there is a reasonable argument that it' was the 305 designers' choice to use a character code with a parity bit, and that choice implies nothing about the underlying 350 HDD, which neither generates nor detects the parity bit and hence can be regarded as a 7-bit drive. Maybe you buy that view maybe you don't, but it is certainly not "objectively wrong" as Tom claims and there is no basis to reject the sources who take that viewpoint.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]])

::Arnold, your "designers' choice" statement is speculative and at best improbable [[WP:OR]].  Virtually all disk drives until the 1990s were incapable of distinguishing bits, be they gap bits (including header), check bits (parity, CRC or ECC) or encoded data bits yet drives were for the most part specified in terms of data (user) bytes with a given format and channel code.  Again the ST506 was specified with MFM and any controller that could write RLL would apparently increase the capacity by 50% but as many found out it wasn't reliable and voided the warranty. You might have a better argument about the unused S bit; maybe it could have been used or maybe not, that is, unpersuasive to me original research and although u can make an original research argument here u need to gain consensus before it can be used in an article.  I don't see why it is so hard, IBM said 6 data bits, 8 channel bits - 7 bits is not supported by any reliable source (albeit there are a lot of people repeating this urban legend). [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 21:18, 12 September 2014 (UTC)   

:::The use of the IBM 350 parity bit as a data bit violates IBM's implicit specifications for the drive so such a calculation cannot be used as a basis for establishing a 4.4 MB capacity. Sort of like saying the ST506 was a 7.5 MB drive because a controller could write and read RLL data at the drive interface.  I have a long explanation of why at [[User:Tom94022/sandbox|my sandbox]] and if anyone wants to discuss my reasoning they can do it here or there.

:::Yet one more way of looking at things!  I hope we all agree that MB means one million data bytes where the byte has 256 unconstrained states.  According to IBM the IBM 350 recorded character has 6 '''data bits''' of which 48 states are used but 64 are available. So dimensional analysis goes like this:
::::(5,000,000 char/IBM350) * (6 data bits/char) / (8 data bits/data byte) / (1,000,000 data byte/million byte) = 3.75 MB of data
:::Advocates of any other use some (other bits/char) dimension to arrive at a number that is (other bits/data bits) MB.  Perhaps an interesting and relevant number but not without context of what are the "other bits" and in what context are they meaningful.  In this context (recorded bits/char) could be meaningful but (data bits + parity bit)/(char) doesn't have any meaning I can think of.

==== Yet another way of looking at the 350 Capacity ====
Modern disk drives are specified by the disk drive vendor in data bytes available to a system (1 data byte = 8 unconstrained data bits).  IBM at that time specified the 350 as 5 million characters and that at the drive's interface there were 6 unconstrained data bits per character.  For Wikipedia purposes this should be the primary value with any other value, particularly something published 50 years later subject to explanation.

There are many bytes and bits under the cover of a modern disk drive but they are not disclosed by the vendors and most are not accessible by a system, but even when they are, they are not normally used by the vendor in specifying the drive's capacity.  For some time some serial bit drives were specified by the vendors in two capacities, unformatted and formatted{{Efn|As near as I can tell this began in the early 70s and ended as all drives became intelligent (e.g. SCSI and PATA) in the 1990s}}.  Even then it was the formatted capacity that most often defined the drive, two examples:
*The ST506 is generally accepted as a 5.0 MB disk drive; it was specified by Seagate as a 5.0 MB formatted and 6.38 MB unformatted.  Using the constraints of the Seagate format it is possible to build a 6.1 MB ST506 and I am sure someone did.  However, even if there was a reliable source for the a 6.1 MB ST506 it would at best rate a footnote in the ST506 article.  Note the [[ST-506]] article states, "5 megabytes after formatting."
*The IBM 3330 with its 3336-1 is generally accepted as a 100 MB disk drive '''even though''' IBM's publications acknowledge that this is with an IBM full track record of 13030 bytes per track, its capacity is less at any number of records per track greater than 1 and the stated capacity did not include 7 spare tracks .  IBM's public maintenance literature for the subsystem discloses an unformatted track length of 13440 bytes/track corresponding to an unformatted capacity of 105 MB. DEC used the identical pack in a fixed block mode and only stored 83 MB. While there are reliable sources for capacities other than 100 I would argue most are of [[WP:un|undue]] weight but some may be worthy of a footnote. Note the [[History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_3330|3330 Section]] states "Its removable disk packs held 100 MB (404x19x13,030 bytes)"

Thanks to the unpublished original research of the RAMAC Restoration team we know the unformatted capacity of the IBM 350 was "about" 5000 bits/track for unformatted IBM 350 capacity of 6.25 MB.  It doesn't matter whether this number is exact or not, because it does allow us to put each of the known 350 bits in proper context.  The 350 consisted of:
:3.750 MB of formatted capacity (disclosed as 6 data bits per character)
:0.625 MB of parity bytes (disclosed as 1 parity bit per character)
:0.625 MB of space bytes (disclosed a 1 space bit per character)
:1.250 MB of other gap bytes (not disclosed but some number is inherent in magnetic recording)
Totaling
:6.250 MB of unformatted capacity (from RAMAC Restoration team)

It is factually correct that 4.375 = 3.75 + 0.625 and rounds to 4.4 but in the context of a 350 it is an incomplete statement of the unformatted capacity so without such context it is obviously factually incorrect, but even if there was a reliable source that placed it in context using 4.4 MB would violate [[WP:UNDUE|undue]].  We don't know how many check bytes are in a modern drive, we know how many in similar bit serial drives but don't publish such in Wikipedia, why do we care about those in the 350?

It is factually correct that 5.0 MB is the modern capacity needed to map the 8 bit recorded character on a bit for bit basis into an 8 bit byte of a modern disk drive.  I'm not sure there is a reliable source for this mapping and I don't think is it particularly relevant but I could accept placing it in a footnote if there is consensus that it should be used.

I will change the article to note the Capacity is "formatted"

::::: And the 650 computer used bi-quinary, because they wanted a machine that did arithmetic in decimal, and electronics to do addition and subtraction in bi-quinary were easier than those for BCD.... but so what? Do you not understand that the character coding in an I/O device can be, and often is, different from that stored in the computer to which the device is attached? Punch cards have possible 12 bits per character position, but that doesn't mean the characters take 12 bits each to store when the computer reads them. 

::::: We have ample good references that the "five million characters" quoted for the 350 referred to six-bit characters. We have no good evidence that the 350 stored 7 bits per character, unless we count the parity bit... and since we don't count the ECC bits when describing modern hard drive capacities, we shouldn't count the parity bit in the 350. As for the 650 - the drive attached to the 650 was actually a 355, not a 350. All of this handwaving about the data format on the 355 is irrelevant to the 350. We can expect similar technologies, but there's no reason to expect them to be identical.

: OK, looking at the manual you linked... I think you did not read enough. "Seven-bit system of coding" is indeed mentioned on page 9. But this does not support your claim. The coding scheme is clearly illustrated on page 8. Certainly there are seven bits per character. But near the top of page eight, first column, it says 

:: ''"There are eight bit positions within each character position. They are identified as bits S, X, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and R. Bit S merely provides a space between the recording bit positions of each character, and is not used in the bit coding. '''Bit R has no numeric or alphabetic value, but is added to certain characters so that every character will have an odd number of bits.'''"'' (emphasis added)

: In other words, it's a six bit code plus a parity bit (bit R) and another bit (bit S) for "spacing".... eight bits total. There is no indication that the 350 disk unit (they call it a "file") stores characters in any other fashion. 
 
: Looks like my conclusion was valid anyway: If "that wraps it up", then I guess you're out of arguments, because this does not provide any evidence that the 350 held anything but 5 million six-bit characters... if we're not counting the parity bit or other "overhead" bits.

::: No, YOU look again. Now ''you're'' confusing the RAMAC305 and the 650. The reference YOU gave for the RAMAC305 does not say one word about "bi-quinary coded decimal", nor about any character coding scheme that could be confused with that, and the "seven-bit system of coding" includes a parity bit. 

::: I mean, really. What part of ''"Bit R has '''no numeric or alphabetic value''', but is added to certain characters so that every character will have an odd nunber of bits"'' leads you to believe that Bit R is the seventh bit in a BQCD code? (That's a direct quote from the IBM RAMAC305 manual that you linked. Top of page 8, first column.) How can it be a bit in a BQCD code if it "has no numeric or alphabetic value"?  That is an excellent description of a parity bit, on the other hand. 

::: Look at the character code chart at the bottom of page 8. It clearly shows that the bits are not weighted as in BQCD, but rather in binary: 1, 2, 4, 8. Digits 1 through 9 were represented in pure BCD: "3" by bits 1 and 2; "5" bit bits 1 and 4; "6" by bits 2 and 4; etc. There is a special case for zero, using the "0 bit", so it is not quite pure BCD but it is flatly NOT bi-quinary coded decimal. And just as clearly, the "R" bit that you claim is the seventh bit for BQCD clearly has no role to play in the numeric values! If it did, then "3", being represented by bits 1, 2, and R, would not have a value of 3 at all. The IBM 305 manual furthermore states, as I quoted, that the "R" bit (the seventh bit) is a parity bit (though not using that word), and the character code table proves it. 

::: Here, let me make it easy for you. Here are the bit codes for the digits 0 through 9, from the RAMAC 305 manual that you linked:

<pre>
  X 0 1 2 4 8 R
0   1
1     1
2       1
3     1 1     1
4         1
5     1   1   1
6       1 1   1
7     1 1 1
8           1
9     1     1 1
</pre>

::: Honestly, does that look like BQCD to you? What flavor of BQCD has an "8" bit and no "5" bit or "3" bit, represents "3" with bits "1" and "2", or "9" with bits "1" and "8"? Answer: None. This is BCD with a special case for zero. 

::: Or are you just going to pretend that the manual you linked doesn't count, or doesn't exist? 

::: This is a "horse's mouth" reference; there is no other possible interpretation; and any reference that states, implies, or can be reasonably interpreted to mean that the 305 used bi-quinary coded decimal is therefore clearly wrong. (And I expect that Al Shugart meant "parity" where he said "binary". A statement of "six bits, plus one binary" would make little sense - what, the six bits aren't binary too?  As for the slide show by Mikkelson...that's cute, but it hardly trumps the IBM reference material. I expect Mikkelson just misremembered (or believed Shugart).  [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 01:40, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

::: And, I just have to respond to this: 

:::: ''"In effect, the machine stores the equivalent of 62,500 80-column IBM cards.... Punched cards had 7 bits per bi-quinary coded decimal character as indicated by this reference:"''

::: Your assertion of BQCD on punched cards is nonsense. Have you ever even looked at one?! IBM punched cards had 80 characters, yes, but they did not use BQCD coding. Each character was represented by digit punches 0 through 9, which for digits simply represented themselves; I think you will agree that there is not a hint of BQCD (or BCD) there. Then there were two "zone punches" called "11" and "12", but these played no part in numeric representations, except that an "11 punch" over the units digit could denote a negative number. (By itself, it represented the minus sign character.) These were combined with the digit punches in various ways to produce letters and a small set of special characters. For more confusion, for some characters, the "0" punch became a zone punch too. Take a look at the character code chart in the [[IBM 1401]] article. (Like the 305, the 1401 made a special case of the internal storage of "0". But instead of having a "zero bit", it represented "0" in core with the "2" and "8" bits set. This probably had something to do with its implementation of BCD arithmetic.) 

::: Your claim that ''"Punched cards had 7 bits per bi-quinary coded decimal character as indicated by this reference:"'' is particularly egregious. First, the slide show you referenced doesn't say a word about BQCD, nor "7 bits". If punched cards were coded using BQCD then each column could only have held one BQCD character - i.e. a digit from 0 through 9 - and that was of course not the case. Coding of the 64-character set supported by IBM cards would have required two columns per character, and that was of course not the case either. 

::: Conclusion: Your claim of BQCD on punched cards is ridiculous. A more realistic interpretation is that by the usual character coding, each column could represent one of about 64 different characters, i.e. 6 bits; that's 480 bits per card, or 60 bytes. BUT! I mightily doubt that IBM was worrying about any of that when they said "62,500 80-column cards", 8-bit bytes not being in common use or maybe not even thought of yet. Hm, one could also think of a punched card as holding 80x12 = 960 bits; that's 120 bytes! (And it is possible on some later IBM machines to read and punch cards and use every possible bit.) But.. Nah. The simple fact is that when you read a card into a computer memory by the usual character coding, it takes 80 character positions in the memory. 62,500 x  80 = 5,000,000 characters, each of which has 64 possible values, encoded in six bits. Hence the claim that the 350 held the equivalent of 62,500 IBM cards. It really is that simple. Your machinations to use this quote to support 7-bit characters (or 4.4 MB) on the 350 is a circular argument; you're assuming 7-bit characters from the beginning. But they're not. The RAMAC 305 manual proves it. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 04:08, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

::: '''Nailing it to the wall:''' Re the 650... We know how digits 0 through 9 were represented, in BQCD. But what of other characters? I have been unable to locate a full character code chart for the 650, but numerous references, including our own WP article, state that characters other than digits were represented as ''pairs'' of BQCD digits! Thus it took ''14 bits'' to represent a character out of a set of 100 possible codes, and the machine's fixed-length 10-digit "word" could hold just 5 characters. This is absolutely ''not'' storing one character in every seven bits, and it is totally different from the 305's internal character set. 

::: One might ask: But why couldn't they store an arbitrary character in one seven-bit BQCD digit position? After all, seven bits give you 128 possibilities,  not just the ten digits represented by BQCD! The answer is that those seven bits are always interpreted by the machine as representing a decimal digit in BQCD form (even if software is interpreting pairs of digits as characters). So there are only a small number of valid configurations. That's the "self-checking" aspect, and it's why they didn't need a parity bit. But if you took advantage of the 128 possible arrangements of seven bits to store (for example) the entire ASCII-7 character set, almost all of them would not be valid BQCD configurations and would cause the machine to raise an error flag ("invalid digit" or some such). 

::: So, your claim that characters were any sort of "common foundation" among these early machines is pretty much belied by the 650. Not only is its character coding ''radically'' different from the 305's, but also, as a character-processing machine, it's an absurd design. Besides taking two digit positions to store one character, it was a fixed-length word (10 digits) machine; so individual digits (and therefore individual characters) were not addressable. This makes the handling of both arbitrary-length character strings and of individual characters very awkward. But it does lead to a better understanding of the info we have on the 355: "six million digits", or three million characters, using the 650's coding scheme of two characters per digit. That's probably why they never quoted the 355's capacity in characters. Stated that way it looks like barely more than half the capacity of the 350. 

::: Back to the RAMAC 305 and its 350 "file": (By the way, although colloquialisms do abound, in terms of official product names there was no "RAMAC 350"; it was the "RAMAC 305" and the "350 file" that was attached to it - check the manual.) Your assumption that all of these early IBM machines used the same internal representation for characters, and that information on the 650's use of BQCD applies equally to the 305, is very clearly flat-out wrong. And all of your conclusions that depend on that assumption are therefore also wrong. They were just very different machines. 

::: In sum: The 305 absolutely did not use BQCD. The manual never mentions BQCD and the character code chart (page 8 of the manual) does not illustrate anything that could be interpreted as BQCD. Bits are called 1, 2, 4, 8, 0, X, and R. That's seven bits, and the manual does say "seven-bit coding", but per the manual, the seventh bit (R) is a parity bit, "carrying no numeric or logical value." So the 350's "5 million characters" are five million six-bit characters, each with a parity bit, which we do not count when counting its usable capacity. The fact that there is no parity bit in BQCD is completely irrelevant, as this machine did not use BQCD (regardless of how many other IBM machines did). QED.

{{od}}We must take your six-bit claim that "bits are not weighted as in BQCD, but rather in binary: 1, 2, 4, 8" on the RAMAC with a grain of salt (shake, shake, shake). It's just an oversalted "two bit" claim. 

RAMAC 650 actually had seven bits per character. The [[IBM 650]] "was a two-address, bi-quinary coded decimal computer".[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650]

Alex Laird has dismissed the (six-bit) binary claim on the 650 RAMAC: "These days, all computer hardware is designed for two-bit binary communication. However, before massive amounts of standardization occurred in the technological realm, a few computers tinkered with the idea of making a computer run on hardware that wasn’t base two. These computers, the Colossus, the UNIVAC, the and IBM 650, to name a few, were coded using bi-quinary coded decimal. Of these, the IBM 650 is the only one that was mass-produced."[http://alexlaird.com/content/uploads/2009/05/topicpaper2-ibm650.pdf] 

Laird goes on to refute the six-bit binary claim on the RAMAC 650 once more, "The hardware communicated using bi-quinary coded decimal instead of in binary coded decimal as all modern computers (and even most historical computers) do."[http://alexlaird.com/content/uploads/2009/05/topicpaper2-ibm650.pdf]

:IBM never officially referred to the 355 as a RAMAC nor is there any evidence that it was the disk drive the industry "started with" as the column is captioned in the article. RAMAC is ambiguous! As near as I can tell IBM used it in product and marketing materials only with the 305, 650 and the much later array.  What is uniquely identified as the IBM 350 disk storage Model 1, has been frequently referred to as the RAMAC so it has that meaning also.  I made a mistake in captioning this Section with "RAMAC" - it should have been "IBM 350."  The IP knows this and continues to use RAMAC ambiguously to assert his point of view.  May I suggest the IP is a [[disruptive user]] in deliberately and continuous using RAMAC in a confusing manner and we should now proceed to a [[Requests_for_comment|request for comment]]?

:: IP: Regarding the punched card issue... ah, another cute slideshow, and this one from a tech blog. This number of theirs is just wrong. Simple arithmetic: 80 columns, each of which represents one of about 64 possible characters. It takes six bits to count from 0 through 63, so that's six bits per column. 80 x 6 bits = 480 bits = 60 bytes total of information if it was packed into eight-bit bytes. How they got to "70 bytes" is a mystery, but however they did, it's obviously wrong. To get there, each column would have to encode 7 bits - i.e. one of 128 possible character codes, rather than one of 64. ''And no commonly-implemented character code ever defined for punched cards ever did that.'' So it's six bits per column. 70 bytes per card? Rejected. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 22:12, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

::: Aside: I worked a LOT with punched cards and I wanted to work with text processing sysytems; I would have loved to have even the 95 printable characters of ASCII-7 available on punched cards. (n.b.: I regard "space" as printable, but not "del".) They were not. Yes, IBM's EBCDIC codeset did define punch combinations for all possible 8-bit internal byte values, but there was no keypunch ever made that would punch them... so we still were limited to about 64 possible characters, just like on the 1401 but with a few different punch combinations. And I assure you, IBM punched cards absolutely did not use BQCD! 

:: For the rest of it... Honestly, falling back on claims that "IBM deliberately confused" the 350 and the 355 just looks like thrashing on your part. We have well established statements of "six million digits" capacity for the 355, and "five million characters" for the 350. The 355 was used with the 650, which did use BQCD; it was clearly a "digit-oriented machine".

==== Coalescing the argument ====

:: But this is about the 350. The 350 held 3.75 million end-user usable bytes, formatted as 5 million 6-bit characters, each with a parity bit. The core of the proof - it's not an argument any longer - is as follows: 

# The 350 goes with the 305. 
# The 305 has a character set consisting of digits in the range 0 through 9, letters A through Z, and a handful of symbols like currency symbol, slash, etc. (Character code chart on page 8 of the RAMAC 350 manual). 
# Bits in each character position are called 1, 2, 4, 8, 0, X, and R. (Character code chart on page 8 of the manual). 
# That's seven bits, but per the text at the top of page 8 of the manual, the seventh bit (R) "carries no numeric or logical value." The manual's description of bit R shows clearly that it is a parity bit, computed to give each character stored an odd number of "1" bits. The character code chart confirms this. 
# So there are six data bits per character. 
# It is true that there is no parity bit in 7-bit BQCD, but this is irrelevant, as BQCD is simply not used in the 305. 
# When IBM says the capacity of the 350 is "5 million characters", this means five million characters of the same format used in the 305. 
# Claims of 7 bits per character in the 350 are widespread in nontechnical sources. However, if this count did not include a parity bit, then each character would have 128 possible values, not 64... and this does not match the character code set of the 305, nor any other manifestation of reality re the 305 or 350. Hence "7 bits per character" means "6 bits plus one for parity", just as it does in the 305 manual. 
# This is further supported by pages 70 and 71 of the ''305 RAMAC Random Access Method of Accounting and Control Manual of Operation'',<ref name="305RAMACMOO"/>  which is explicitly describing ''"The method of coding these characters '''on the disk and drum tracks'''"'' (emph. added) and clearly describes the seventh bit '''on the IBM 350 disk''' as a parity bit. The character code chart provided on page 71 confirms it; there is no "data significance" to bit R; it is the seventh of seven bits shown, and it is a parity bit, matching the description in the preceding text. This is a "horse's mouth" document and there is just no wiggle room here. 
# So, five million characters x 6 bits each = 30 million end-user usable bits. 
# 30 million bits at 8 bits per byte is 3.75 million bytes.

:4. This is the crux of the issue. The 350 neither generated nor was aware of the parity bit. That was internal to the 305 CPU. Nor is there any indication that the parity bit was needed or used specifically to enhance the 350s reliability, indeed any parity failure halted the CPU. If someone today built a text processing machine that exclusively used 7-bit ASCII with parity and stored that text on a modern hard drive, we would not say the hard drive then became a 7-bit drive.

Also no one is disputing that the parity bit was stored on the 350. But again that parity bit is only generated and tested in the 305 CPU, not the disk drive. The 350 could store any 7 bit pattern, and there is a suggestion from a timing chart in the CE manual that 8 bits were possible.

There is no basis for an assumption that the parity bit was not needed; it is original research and likely incorrect.  The analogy is most every drive thereafter into the 1990s, e.g., the ST506, which had a specified unformatted capacity (i.e., 6.38 MB for the ST506) and a capacity specified by the manufacturer in a given format (i.e., 5.0 MB for the ST506).

====Reply to counter argument====

1. How do you know it was the exact same mechanism? And how do you know it used the exact same electronics? The 355's "six million digits" does not make it sound like it was formatted the same way. If stored in BQCD straight from the 650, that would take 42 million bits; compare with the 350's 36 million bits (I count parity bits there because parity is inherent in BQCD code). It would have taken a trivial circuit to convert BQCD to and from simple four-bit BCD with a parity bit and store them that way... but that's only 30 million bits including parity, a significant step down from the 350's 35 million bits including parity. No.. the 355 must have had a different formatter.

:: The "differences in the electronics" are key to the whole thing. If they were the same device they would have had the same number. 

2. That's just an artifact of the circuits in the card reader and card punch. There are six bits per character position in the 305, even if the peripheral equipment IBM chose to build doesn't let you get at all 64 possible characters.

4. ''"The 350 neither generated nor was aware of the parity bit."'' How do you know this? Anyway, this is a red herring. Even if it is true, since the only way to store data on a 350 was via a 305, and the 305 would error check if it detected a character with even parity, there would be no way to store such characters on the 350. Hence the 350 can be used to store five million six-bit characters. I think this is a distinction without a difference. 
:The 305 operations manual is clear on this. See page 70-71, and figure 47.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 22:09, 19 September 2014 (UTC)
:: Um, maybe. You know perfectly well that diagrams of this sort (even the "schematics" in the CE doc) are "cartoons"; they leave out a lot of detail. We can't conclude that there was nothing in the 350 that checked or generated the parity bit. This leaves us with the 305 and 350 docs, which state explicitly that the seventh bit is a parity bit, "carrying no numeric or logical value." It is OR on your part to infer from the IBM docs that it would have been possible in some way to use the 350 without the 305, and thereby (or by any other means for that matter) to store seven data bits per character, no parity.

:::IBM manuals of the era were written carefully. The 305 operations manual section is describing error handling.

But I suggest you are the one engaging in OR by reading the manual in just one way to exclude certain sources a (like the program manager for the 350) as "unreliable."

4a. ''"If someone today built a text processing machine that exclusively used 7-bit ASCII with parity and stored that text on a modern hard drive, we would not say the hard drive then became a 7-bit drive."''

5. See reply 2 (and 4a). There are six data bits. 

9. Actually, yes, we do pick and choose, in that we evaluate the reliability of sources. When we see a tech blog say "70 bytes per card" with absolutely no justification nor reference, and simple arithmetic (the same sort you're doing in your step 5) proves otherwise, we can decide that that source is not reliable on that point. Similarly, a slide whipped up for a fun talk at a SHARE meeting is not of the same reliability as the manufacturer's user and CE manuals.

The 350, connected to the 305 as it had to be, could ''not'' store "any 7 bit pattern", not unless the parity check in the 305 failed. 
:Again the manual is clear on this. IBM computers of this era halted on a parity check, not just the 305. More sophisticated responses came later. And, no the 350 drive did not have to be connoted to a 305, it just was. In analyzing at a hard drive is is reasonable to consider it in isolation, just as we would a modern hard drive incorporated into an integrated system. And if you do look at the 350/305 as a system the data is characters from a 48 bit set.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 22:09, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

11. See 9.

::I've spent a fair bit of time in the 305 Manual<ref name="305CEMan"/> which I suggest is the only reliable source for this discussion.  The manual clearly shows a bit serial data interface; bit serial disk drives are traditionally specified at their interface with the format given by the drive vendor, not by what the system does with it, so much of the chatter about the 305 is irrelevant beyond the format.  The format is disclosed a block comprising a leading gap with some bits, 100 8 bit characters and a trailing gap.  Arnold is partially correct that "The 350 neither generated nor was aware of the parity bit." - this is pretty clear from the circuit diagrams, but it is more complete to note that the 350 did not know the meaning of any bit.  Since the recorded character is 8 bits the manual makes any 7-bit or 4.4 MB assertions suspect.  No one yet has stated the basis for omitting the space bit but adding the parity bit.  Further more, the IBM specified format constrains many bits in the block, including the parity and space bit.  The 305 manual specifies at its bit serial interface 30 million unconstrained bits and lots of other constrained bits, but since modern HDD capacity is measured in bytes of 8 unconstrained bits the only valid capacity for comparison is 3.75 MB. [[User:Tom94022/350Facts|My proof]] is somewhat different than JEHs but we arrive at the same conclusion and I hope Arnold now will agree.

:::I've pointed out above that the space bit must be suppressed before data gets to the core buffer, according to the CE manual, p.189. On the other hand the parity bit is presented to the core buffer and is only checked there. So there are different valid ways of looking at the capacity of the 305 for comparison purposes. I argue that when we make our smug comparison about how much better modern drives are we should take the most conservative view of that ratio and compare characters with modern bytes, because that is how users employed the drives then and now.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 22:09, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

::::Arnold you also pointed out that "In analyzing at a hard drive is is reasonable to consider it in isolation, just as we would a modern hard drive incorporated into an integrated system."  Exactly, the core buffer is a part of the 305 system not part of an isolated drive.  There is no "check" on any bit in the 350 but if the S bit is not generated by the drive, all subsequent decodes of the characters of one block in the system will be wrong and some will cause a parity error upstream from the drive, but nothing will happen in an isolated drive.  So what makes the parity bit so special that we count it but not the space bit ?  In isolation the data interface of the 350 is just a stream of bits, with the S and P both required and providing no information.  In isolation the drive can't distinguish any bit, but a drive failure to generate properly either the S bit or the P bit will cause the system to report an error.  There really is no justification for using just 7 bits of the 8 bits per character in the bit stream other than it is an urban legend.  There is nothing smug about this comparison, but it sure sounds like you have a point of view to minimize the improvement.

::::Please take a careful look at figure 86 on page 86/253 of the 305 CE Manual<ref name="305CEMan" /> particularly the lines labeled "Disk Write Data" (the serial input stream), "Disk Flux" (what is written to the disk) and "Disk Data" (the serial output stream).  This is the IBM format for the 350.  Note there are 200 usec of AGC bits (about 166 bits) at the beginning of a block.  You have to write them, u can't use them for anything else or the drive might not replay correctly.  Note the about 400 usec region with no bits,  it's there for a reason so writing bits into it may have unpredictable results.  At the end of this blank region is the S bit of the first character, followed but the remaining 7 bits of the first character and then followed by the remaining 99 characters of the block.  Elsewhere the spec says there is a 180 usec blank gap after the last character.  IBM constrains the P and S bits so that a character has only the 64 available states of the 6 data bits.  This is the only published IBM format that can be used to calculate the capacity in current terms.  Absent a source that explains how they are going to get 128 states or 256 states out of these 8 bits as specified by IBM we have to conclude that such a calculation is wrong.

::::The industry has come somewhat of a full circle, from bit serial data interfaces to bit serial interfaces with data in one of several packets across that interface.  There are lots of serial bits in today's packet any of which could be redesignated by a adapter designer but that would clearly violate the spec and be rejected by today's smart drives.  Yesterday's dumb drive would accept them and replay whatever it could but there would be no guarantee that the playback would be reliable, even if one read after writing.  Some SAS drives do have additional bits that could be used for additional capacity, the extra bits in the 520 or 538 byte sectors, without posting an error but they are not counted by the drive vendor in specifying capacity, a [http://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/enterprise-hdd-fam/enterprise-capacity-2-5-hdd/en-us/docs/enterprise-capacity-2-5-hdd-ds1719-5-1409us.pdf Seagate ST2000NX0273] is 2 TB regardless of the sector size. Capacity is based upon the manufactures specs and IBMs specs yield a capacity in current terms of 3.75 Bytes.

::::Arnold I hope this will convince you, but if not I suppose I could live with 3.75 as the main value with footnotes saying "Other reported  capacities of 4.4 MB (based upon 7-bits per character) and 5.0 MB (based upon 8 bits per character) would result in $xxxx/MB and $yyyy/MB" [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 16:48, 20 September 2014 (UTC)

:::::: As has been pointed out to you already, the IBM documents specific to the 305/350 do describe a seven-bit code... ''and go on to describe the seventh bit as a parity bit.'' Using phrases like '''"carrying no numeric or logical value"''' to describe it. (I really don't understand how you can continue to ignore those words.) It's a parity bit. Yes, there are some ''shorter'' descriptions that simply say "seven bits" but ''every'' more technical document, more specific to the 305/350, notes that the seventh bit is a parity bit. 
:::::: ''"Currently-produced systems use a 51-character seven-bit parity-checked code."'' Yes, seven bits including the parity bit - hence six data bits. As thoroughly described in the 305/350 documentation. The entire capability of this code is not quite fully utilized by the 305/350, as indicated by: 
:::::: ''"the current seven-bit code has a capacity of 64 characters."'' Right, because without the parity bit (which is one of the seven has amply documented in the 305 manuals), you have six data bits, giving 64 possible characters. If the seventh bit was not a parity bit it would have 128 possible characters. These points do not contradict the claim of six data bits, they are consistent with it. 
:::::: ''"[[Bi-quinary coded decimal]] has seven bits per character."'' Wrong. BQCD has seven bits ''per decimal digit.'' Every IBM computer and device (650, 355, NOT the 305 or 350) that used BQCD had to use two such decimal digits to represent each possible "character", giving 100 possible characters. BQCD and any machine that used BQCD is irrelevant to this discussion. The document you are referencing is a general description, giving the codes and techniques used in a variety of different machines. You can't use anything it says about BQCD in a discussion of the 305, or the 350, or the system that included both. That BQCD uses seven bits per decimal digit (and has an inherent built-in error check, so no parity bit was deemed necessary), while the coding used in the 305 used six bits plus a parity bit, also totaling seven, is mere coincidence. 
:::::: You have had these facts explained to you several times now, and your bringing up BQCD yet AGAIN, as if it had anything at all to do with the 305/350, is unproductive at best. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 22:03, 20 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::: In sum, the ''careful, thorough, technically competent, and honest'' reader of IBM docs of this era—a reader who is not cherry-picking sentences in an attempt to advance an already thoroughly-discredited position—will read the material specific to the 305/350, will find the references to the "seven bit code"... but will also find (and not ignore) the description of the seventh bit as being used only for error checking, '''"carrying no numeric or logical value"'''. A bit that "carries no numeric or logical value" cannot be used in a capacity calculation, as long as we are not using the ECC bits in modern hard drives in their capacity calculations.

==== Wrapping up ====

'''My conclusion so far:''' IBM docs presented so far do not explicitly rule out the possibility of using the 350 to store seven data bits per character, with no parity. However, until RSs '''of the same trust level''' are presented that explicitly indicate this is possible, such speculation on the part of WP editors is just that. We must go with the most trusted, most detailed, and most specific RSs, the 305/350 documents already extensively cited. They state clearly that the seventh bit was a parity bit and not generally usable, "carrying no numeric or logical value". Until '''equally''' reliable sources are presented stating that it was possible to use the seventh bit for arbitrary data, the conclusion of "5 million six-bit characters" must stand. Since the IBM docs state "seven bits per character" but then go on to say that one is a parity bit, this is not contradicted by various claims of "seven bits per character". There ''were'' seven bits per character, just, one of them was only ever used as a parity bit. To put the calculation on equal footing with specs for modern hard drives, we don't count the parity bit, any more than we would count the ECC bits in modern hard drives.

== Strange sentence ==

"Computers do not internally represent HDD or memory capacity in powers of 1,024; reporting it in this manner is just a convention."  — I can't make any sense of this sentence.  What does "internally represent HDD or memory capacity" mean?  Of course most computers store most numbers in binary. [[User:Zero0000|Zero]]<sup><small>[[User_talk:Zero0000|talk]]</small></sup> 02:22, 28 September 2014 (UTC)

:: "Storing a number in binary" is not equivalent to "storing a number scaled by a power of 1024". What the sentence is trying to say is that space on a hard drive (or a partition, or a volume, or free space) is not counted internally in GB or TB or GiB or TiB or whatever. The internal count is rather in blocks. That's how the HD reports its capacity: As the number of available Logical Block Addresses. The typical "2 TB" hard drive with 512-byte blocks would be reported, and recorded internally, as having 3,906,250,000 blocks (assuming that the "2 TB" is exact; usually drives hold a few more blocks than the claimed capacity). It's true that this largish integer would be stored "in binary", but the point here is that the binary number does not have to be multiplied by a power of 1024 to get the size in bytes. It is merely the display utility (such as the "Properties" dialog in Windows) that decides to divide the number of blocks by 1024^4  so as to display the size as "1.82 TB" (really TiB). To display size in bytes, the internal number ''does'' have to be multiplied by the block size, is 512 bytes on most drives today, 4096 with 4Kn drives - neither of those are powers of two. As Tom said, if you can come up with better wording on this point, please do so. If you don't want to edit the article directly, suggest your wording here and we can beat it around a bit. Thanks!

::: I know everything you wrote, but it doesn't make the sentence any better. The part "in this manner" seems to refer to reporting in powers of 10, but the grammar would indicate "this" refers to "in powers of 1,024".  Also, you are right that many data sizes are measured in blocks or pages, but other things are not (eg. file sizes).  The operating system can keep sizes in any form or format it pleases.  I think that's the real point.  It is also wrong to put "HDD" and "memory capacity" together because RAM chips are measured with the GB=2<sup>30</sup> convention.  Personally I would just delete the sentence, but if you must have something I'd suggest some variation of "Reporting HDD using powers of ten is just a convention in the industry and does not reflect the way that storage capacities are represented in the computer.".

I'm happy to just clarify the grammar, but if u still think it is strange, then perhaps in yr language, how about, "Reporting on HDD and memory capacity (or usage) in powers of 1,024 is a convention and does not reflect the way that they are represented in the computer."

== Discuss: was the rate of areal density growth decreased circa 2006 or 2010? ==

Data at [http://blogs-images.forbes.com/tomcoughlin/files/2014/09/HDD-AD-Chart.png]

:The [http://blogs-images.forbes.com/tomcoughlin/files/2014/09/HDD-AD-Chart.png linked graph] does not explicitly disclose a date for a "kink" in the AD curve nor does the author, Coughlin, state one in the article publishing the graph.  It would be difficult to trend data points from the graph since Coughlin apparently used a smooth curve function in connecting the data points.  Even if one tried, the "kink" is dependent upon the number of data points selected for a recent trend line, which would be impermissible OR. The displayed White curve has a clear kink between two trend lines in the mid 2000s and the Anderson 2013 cite, depending upon how you read it, suggests a "kink" occurred between 2008 and 2010.  The date of the "kink" appears to be inadvertent disagreement among sources - inadvertent, because we are interpreting the published data in a way that they perhaps never intended it to be used.  Personally I think "since c. 2007-2011" is awkward and would suggest "after 2005" as a way of expressing all sources in a readable manner.  It is also acceptable to just leave out a date for the kink as undue since does it really matter when the kink occurred?

::The date of the inflection is discernible and notable. An analyst with Morningstar has indeed explicitly disclosed “around 2010” as the date of the slowing in areal density.[http://blogs-images.forbes.com/tomcoughlin/files/2014/09/HDD-AD-Chart.png] This analyst finds “a slowing areal density curve … that slowed around 2010 and will advance areal density 25% annually till 2020.”[http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=STX&region=usa&culture=en-US&productcode=MLE] [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 18:58, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

:::IMO the date of inflection is not discernible from Coughlin.  Yet another analyst stating "around 2010" doesn't help much.  Its pretty clear that different sources looking at different sets of data can find different dates for the "kink" which we could treat as difference among sources requiring some consideration to all or since it is not clear to me why the specific date of the "kink" is notable, we can just ignore this.  Readability is important, isn't it?  22:42, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

::::Notability and relevance are the foundation of readability. Various analysts using different data sources have noted the inflection around 2010. Hitachi Data Systems Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Hu Yoshida, writes that a “paper in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics Vol 48 May 2012 shows that the roadmap for areal density increases in magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) has slowed down” and the paper has a chart “which shows that the decline has been going on since 2010.”<ref name="Yoshida 2013-02-19">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hds.com/hu/2013/02/hdds-and-nand-flash-will-be-around-for-some-time.html |title=HDDs and NAND Flash will be Around for Some Time |last=Yoshida |first=Hu |work=blogs.hds |publisher=Hitachi Data Systems |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2014-09-27 |quote=roadmap for areal density increases in magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) has slowed down … the decline has been going on since 2010 }}</ref> [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 17:44, 27 September 2014 (UTC)

::::::Other references support other inflection dates.  Furthermore so do some u cite.  Yoshida <ref name="Yoshida 2013-02-19" /> acknowledges he has "written several times about the declining rate of areal bit densities" and the graph he points to clearly has an inflection in the middle 2000s to 40% CAGR since prior to that time there is universal agreement that the prior growth rate was in the range of 60-100%.  Coughlin's chart appears to have an inflection circa 2005 and perhaps circa 2008; he is on the record that the CAGR circa 2010 was about 30%, again a substantial decline from 60-100%.  I can't access the Morningstar reference so I can't comment on its perspective.  We have to avoid an inappropriate [[WP:SYN|synthesis]] which seems to have occurred in yr last edit.  Actually an inflection date might not yet be at all appropriate since What appears to have been going on since the mid-2000s is that the AD rate of change has been more or less continuously been decreasing to the now current low of about 8-12% (of course, this might change with the next disk drive announcement, up or down).  Since the data show a continuing slowdown rather than an inflection its not clear why any one date is more notable than another and it is more readable to just say something like
:::::::"However, the growth rate trend has been decreasing since 2006 and, as of 2014, growth has been in the annual range of 8–12%"

::::::Depending upon the language, either the Yoshida or Coughlin reference would be appropriate, not both. [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 21:25, 28 September 2014 (UTC)

:Simply changing the date of an inflection point misleads by implying there has been only one inflection point since the CAGR was 60-100% circa 2005.  There are at least two maybe more, or maybe none. At this point there are so few data points since 2010 that it is not clear that there has been an inflection about 2010.  I suggest the important point to the reader is that it dropped from a very high level to the current level and not how it got there, one or two or no inflection points.

:::As I said before two of your citations support at least two inflection points.  As usual you ignore evidence that contradicts your viewpoint.  To repeat:
:::#Coughlin 2014<ref name="Coughlin 2014-09A" /> clearly shows at least two possible changes in slope, one about 1Q2005 and the one you prefer about 1Q2009.  Furthermore Coughlin in 2010 looking at an earlier version of the same chart stated, "AD growth appears to be slowing to ~30% annually."<ref>[http://www.tomcoughlin.com/Techpapers/Invest%20in%20New%20Technologies%20or%20Divest%20in%20Market%20Share,%20090210.pdf] Invest in New Technologies or Divest in Market Share, Coughlin Associates, (c)2010</ref>
:::# Yoshida 2013<ref name="Yoshida 2013-02-19" /> acknowledges he has "written several times about the declining rate of areal bit densities" and the graph he points to clearly has an inflection in the middle 2000s to 40% CAGR since prior to that time there is universal agreement that the prior growth rate was in the range of 60-100%.
:::FWIW Coughlin 2014 looks like what a transition from what was exponential growth to what is now low linear growth in which case the slope thru any set of points on a semilog plot would continuously decline.  If Coughlin published his data it would be interesting to see whether the data since 2006 best fit a linear curve or an exponential curve.  This is one reason why I prefer the simple description rather than finding trends where they may not exist.
:::Correct me if I am wrong but unlike you I see about a two year gap in Coughlin 2014 data points from the about 1Q2011 to 1Q2013 and then only one or two points there after.  At a 10% CAGR it takes 5 to 7 years to clearly see exponential growth and with only 1-3 data points covering 3 years its hard to call it an exponential trend  (the other two trends in the section span 50 and 15 years with many points).
:::There is nothing about the quotes u cite that exclude the existence of decreases prior to 2010.
:::It is not necessary to have an explicit "around 2006" quote since we have reliable sources in graphs of Coughlin, Yoshida and Whyte that the slope changed around 2006. Since u found two of these sources I think that would be sufficient. 
:::Reliable sources show that there are at least two inflection points, so that both the original statement and your proposed "simple" edit are incomplete and therefore misleading.  The simplest statement is that the growth rate has been declining since about 2006 to about 8-10% in 2014.  I suppose it is also accurate and more complete to say that AD CAGR dropped to about 30% per year from about 2006 to 2010 and dropped again to about 8-10% from 2011 to 2014, citing Coughlin 2014 and Anderson but that seems like too much detail.  You should note I have omitted the word "dramatically" since it is not clear which is more dramatic, 100-60% dropping to 30% or 30$ dropping to 8-10% nor has the word been used in any source.  I can live with either the complete description or the simple one but I prefer the simple version.  The current one inflection description is misleading.

Both the current statement and yr proposed change have truthiness.  All of the sources point to AD trend dropping below a 60-100% trend well prior to 2010, some as early as 2002.  This is fairly summarized by replacing the current sentence as follows:

=== Please arrive at consensus here, and THEN change the article accordingly ===

You two are edit-warring in the article. Edit-warring is not confined to simple reverts. Once a disagreement over content is evident, the subject text should be reverted to its pre-dispute state (I've done that) and no further changes should be made to the affected part of the article until a new consensus has been established via talk page discussion. Repeatedly changing the article back and forth, ''even if you think your change is backed by sources and that those sources are definitive'', is unproductive, [[WP:TEND|tendentious]], disrespectful of other editors, and confuses readers.

== Partitions? File systems? RAID? ==

These are artifacts of how most operating systems use HDDs, but they're not actually about the drives. They all apply to SSDs and small "flash drives" as well. Just how far into these details does this article need to go? We have to stop somewhere.  [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 16:52, 19 November 2014 (UTC)

:Good point.  But just because some newer technology supports something that was originally designed for the old doesn't mean it isn't associated with the old.

: Agreed, back at the time all that was designed specifically to be used with HDDs.  Later, some of that technology was adapted or adjusted for flash-based storage, for example file systems specifically designed to be used on top of raw flash, and partition alignment (which completed a circle with 4Kn HDDs){{snd}} just to name a few.  Thus, it's Ok to be included in the article. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 04:41, 20 November 2014 (UTC)

:: But to what level of detail? All of these things have their own articles (or should), so I think coverage here should be limited to a few sentences each, each with a WL to the corresponding article. We should also mention that in some environments there were no partitions or file systems. In IBM S/360 operating systems, a "data set" was simply defined as a number of cylinders, and any JCL stream that knew the magic syntax to refer to a set of cylinders could make them available to programs within the job. Assignment of sets of cylinders to various uses was done manually. The sector size wasn't fixed either - an installation could define what they wanted the sector size to be, all the way up to an entire track. ({{u|Tom94022}} knows much more about this than I do.) I suppose you could call it "partitioning" but there was nothing recorded on the hard drive to define the partitions. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 07:14, 20 November 2014 (UTC)

* '''Comment''' I was originally going to agree with 65.94.43.89 that "hard disk" is the most common terminology, but it seems that all major manufacturers do indeed lists their products as "hard drives" or "drives". Perhaps it's best to keep it at the current, albeit slightly archaic, title as a compromise. In my opinion, this should, like [[solid-state drive]] be written in properly hyphenated fashion: "hard-disk drive" (it's a hard disk that's being driven, not a disk drive that's hard), but no one seems to do this. (Interestingly, for removable media, there is a clear distinction between the two terms: a floppy disk is something very different than a floppy drive; the same would probably apply those old DEC hard drives with removable hard disks.) —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 11:35, 14 March 2015 (UTC)

**{{Anchor|NOTCOMMON}}'''Further comment''' in response to some !votes below: Even policies can be overridden by consensus if it's for good reasons. [[WP:COMMONNAME]] in particular is hardly fodder for an "open and shut" case. It is full of not-absolutes, using words like "Wikipedia ''prefers''" and "Wikipedia  does ''not necessarily'' use..." (emph. added). Further, the "common" in COMMONNAME explicitly refers not to common usage by the general public, but to the name used commonly "in reliable sources". n.b.: Google hit counts are not reliable sources for establishing a "common name", because there is no way of knowing if the appearances they're counting are in what we would consider reliable sources. 
::In addition, many of the examples given at COMMONNAME are not really parallel to this case. "Hard drive", "Hard disk", and "Hard disk drive" are all recognizably very similar, such that no one is going to arrive at this article, look at the title, and immediately think "Oh, wrong place... I wanted the article on hard drives." (Or "...hard disks.") That is the situation COMMONNAME is trying to avoid, and that just isn't going to happen here. The same can't be said for, to quote a few of the examples at COMMONNAME: "Bono" vs. "Paul Hewson", "Cat Stevens" vs. "Yusuf Islam" or "Steven Georgiou", "Lady Gaga" vs. "Stefani Germanotta", "Syahrini" vs. "Rini Fatimah Jaelani", etc. Granted there are a few there that are more parallel to this case, like "Liberace" vs. "Wladziu Liberace"... but there are far more that are not... and this is not my only argument against "Hard drive" or "Hard disk". 
::As for [[WP:CONCISE]], there is no absolute requirement there for the shortest string of words, let alone the fewest number of characters (I refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHard_disk_drive&diff=651584631&oldid=651580387 this], possibly the silliest-while-still-arguably-serious argument I've ever seen in a talk page discussion; I'm still not sure if the IP was being facetious or not). What CONCISE really says is: ''"The goal of conciseness is to '''balance''' brevity with sufficient information to identify the topic to a person familiar with the subject area."''. (emph. added.) We have that title now. 
::Even if we would be lead to "Hard drive", there is another problem: COMMONNAME says ''"Ambiguous or inaccurate names for the article subject, as determined in reliable sources, are '''often''' avoided ''even though they may be more frequently used by reliable sources.''"'' (emph. added) I submit that "hard drive" is ungrammatical and inaccurate because on its face it appears to refer to "a drive that is hard", making no reference to the disks. And "hard disk" seems to refer to just the platters. That leaves us with "Hard disk drive" as an unambiguous, accurate, grammatical, instructive, reasonably concise, and certainly not ''un''common name for the mechanism plus the platters. 
:: Finally, article renames are at least moderately disruptive, and so should be avoided unless there is good reason for them. That is lacking here. "Iffen it ain't broke, don't fix it." [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 06:11, 16 March 2015 (UTC)

::: It could be that there is simply relatively less computer literature in Google's index for recent years. Either because less was published or because less was indexed. For example, Google Books has scanned many computer magazines from the '80s and '90, but there seems to be less available for more recent years (because of copyright concerns, I guess).

*'''Keep at "hard disk drive"''' Okay, I've read some of the arguments made here and given it some thought. While I initially disliked the current article title, I think it should not be renamed for two reasons (one pragmatic and one more principal):
:# There are two equally common names: "hard disk" and "hard drive" and there is really no objective criteria for us to prefer one over the other as the article title. The longer title "hard disk drive", while less common than both, is still not a rare term and makes for a good compromise.
:# This article discusses the complete history of hard disk drives. While it doesn't really matter if you refer to a modern HDD as a "disk" or a "drive", this distinction does become important for earlier HDDs which sometimes consisted of a separate drive and a removable disk pack. I think this is a strong argument for preferring a more pedantic title over what is common usage for referring to modern HDDs.

== Splitting ==

The "Hard disk drive" article is currently 106,339 bytes.
According to the [[WP:SIZERULE]] guideline, it almost certainly should be divided into smaller articles.

I suggest we [[WP:SPINOUT]] each of the the main sections of this article into sub-articles, so the "Hard disk drive" article contains only summaries of those articles.

In particular, it seems to me that the following main sections have enough "[[Wikipedia: Notability]]" to spin out into stand-alone articles:
* [[hard disk drive#Technology]] --> [[hard disk drive technology]]
* [[hard disk drive#Capacity]] --> [[hard disk drive capacity]]
* [[hard disk drive#Form factors]] --> [[hard disk drive form factor]]
* [[hard disk drive#Market segments]] --> [[hard disk drive market]]
* [[hard disk drive#External hard disk drives]] --> [[external hard disk drive]]

Is there a better way to divide this article into smaller articles?

== Most computers also have memory chips ==

I find this statement somewhat fatuous: 

<blockquote>
Computers internally do not represent either hard drive or memory capacity in powers of 1,024; reporting it in this manner is a convention.
</blockquote>

I've personally never seen a BCD-encoded memory chip addressing scheme.  The convention of using binary MBs and GBs better aligns with how ''memory'' capacity is expressed.  

A system with 4 GB of memory and a 4 GB disk drive (perhaps a firewall with a bootable thumb drive) would definitely have <tt>4 × 1024<sup>3</sup></tt> bytes of memory, so the question then becomes whether the ''other'' mention of 4 GB should mean something different.   

It might be a convention, but there was a certain amount of sanity involved that some wish to forget. 

That said, it's just better to adopt GiB across the board and be done with it. 

It's not just the computer that has memory, but the disk drive itself, which usually expresses its cache memory as 16 MB or something like that.  So really it comes down to ''which'' consistency one wishes to prefer. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 08:56, 19 June 2015 (UTC)

: Hello!  Regarding the quoted sentence, it's all about how the memory capacity is ''reported''.  With your example, the system would actually have 4&nbsp;× 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes of DRAM and 4&nbsp;× 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes of hard disk drive storage, plus some DRAM for the HDD buffer, possibly some more DRAM for the video card memory, some more SRAM for the CPU and HDD's microcontroller caches, and some flash/EEPROM storage for the system and HDD firmware.  Speaking of those 4&nbsp;× 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes of HDD storage, the drive manufacturer would ''advertise'' it as a 4&nbsp;GB drive, some operating systems would ''report'' it as 4&nbsp;GB and others as 3.72&nbsp;GB, while the computer would only ''know and care about'' the total number of addressable sectors on the drive.  Furthermore, it isn't that we can or should adopt GiB, storage manufacturers use and have been using powers of ''ten'' instead to express the capacity of their products. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 11:32, 19 June 2015 (UTC)
{{outdent}}
These sort of issues crop up all the time on Wikipedia. There are a variety of practices in the computer industry when representing the magnitude of different computer capacities. Lately, it's often powers of ten when expressing storage, and powers of two when expressing memory. However—as many others have pointed out here and in innumerable archived discussions throughout the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXTpASSd9xE Mandelbrot-like landscape] that is Wikipedia discussions—practices vary depending on ''when'' in computer technology, ''what'' exact technology it is, ''who'' made the equipment, and ''which publication'' one reads on a given subject.

This article is a general-interest one directed to a general interest readership. Wikipedians best serve our readership when we are careful to use the prevailing computer-speak of the day, abandon any notion that our adoption of neat ideas like “kibibytes” will help speed adoption of such terminology (it didn't, doesn’t, never will, confuses most readers, and elicits bewilderment if the reader repeats it elsewhere), and be careful to avoid stating that “something is ''this way''” if in fact, alternative practices and measures are also widely used in the discipline. If there was a historical practice in measuring capacity that would mislead our readership unless one clarifies the matter, then proper technical writing practice is to clarify.

Throughout Wikipedia, verbiage and units of measure should—where practical—be those commonly used today in the respective industry or discipline so readers are properly prepared for further reading elsewhere. Prose that least calls attention to itself is superior prose. Links should adhere to the principle of “least astonishment”; which is to say, readers should be able to reasonably anticipate the type of article to which they are being taken.

:The "reliable source" is a marketing department press release. But this particular reference is no longer valid: the company website no longer carries this press release. A citation is needed. 

:SMR itself is merely the "first step," and reaching the "2020" milestone presumes further steps: HAMR, TDMR and possibly BPM. Climbing to the top of a skyscraper or proposing an A380 aircraft design isn't the "first step" to landing a man on the moon by 2020. The "2020" date is pure speculation. Furthermore, the 20TB HDD is too vague to use as a milestone because it's just a capacity figure, not an areal density milestone. Cramming more disks into the same form factor, as they've done with some of the 8 TB and 10 TB drives, does not advance areal density. Marketing fluff, hype, and vague capacity claims six or seven years out in the future that pre-suppose as-yet-unreleased new technologies don't belong in Wikipedia.[[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 22:01, 19 December 2014 (UTC)

{{od}}Think carefully, dear Tom94, as you're issuing these threats. You sound familiar with sanctions, likely because you've been on the receiving end of them. A review would expose your years-long and tawdry record of tendentious edits and conflicts with other editors. I'd welcome a review, but you wouldn't.

We all know that growth can't continue forever, and Moore put this plainly in 1995. Still, it might be worthwhile to reiterate this. No matter how much room there is for ''capacity'' or areal density improvement, and we all know that there's a lot of room, the amount of room is not infinite. ''Forever'' is a really long time, and nothing grows for that long. 

We all know that the indefinite future is an “open question,” and this statement adds nothing to this article.

Bear in mind that the issue isn't ''capacity per drive'': it's areal density or ''capacity per platter.'' Storage cost per bit, areal density and capacity per platter are important, but capacity per drive is less so. It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that "areal density and capacity are related," without defining what capacity means. Areal density (meaning capacity per platter) is a subset of drive capacity. In other words, improving areal density (capacity per platter) lowers storage cost per bit, while adding platters to a drive may not lower storage cost per bit. So advancement depends on how capacity per drive is increased: adding platters doesn't bring much advancement but improving areal density does. For this reason, ''capacity per drive'' is vague and causes confusion in this article. 

The “2020” statement concerning capacity per drive is redundant, since areal density forecasts are already discussed separately in this article. Their median is 20% per year. [[Special:Contributions/71.128.35.13|71.128.35.13]] ([[User talk:71.128.35.13|talk]]) 00:11, 23 December 2014 (UTC)

::The "2020" claim should be deleted, no matter which authority made it. Firstly, it concerns capacity per drive which is not important as has been explained above in detail. 

::The claimed capacity in 2020 would have to be converted to an areal density growth rate to have much meaning. But, areal density growth forecasts are discussed elsewhere, and the median forecast is 20% per year. This "2020" forecast is too vague to contribute to that stable. So once again, the "2020" claim should be deleted, no matter which authority made it. It sounds important, but means little unless converted, interpreted and explained. The "2020" is a quintessential marketing claim that sounds great but is empty in reality. 

::Finally, remember that this is just the "first step." Skyscrapers and jet planes aren't the first step to putting a man on the moon, and SMR isn't the first step to a high capacity per platter, with high areal density and low storage cost per bit, unless several more developments like HAMR and BPR were assured. But, they're not assured.

{{od}}I undid the IPs revision again, since he has stated nothing new and has not convinced any other editor that his proposed deletions have merit.  It would certainly help if he proposed improvements rather than just destruction.  For example Dismic's proposed language could be worked into something like:
*One such technology, shingled magnetic recording (SMR), was introduced by Seagate in 2013 as a first step to reaching a 20 TB HDD by 2020.
And the open question language could be worked into something like:
*...whether HDD areal density growth rate ever returns to its previous high rate is unclear.
I think there is relevant summary material in each statement objected to so I am reluctant to agree to obliteration.  Hopefully the IP will respond with proposed language rather than insisting on his way.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 07:32, 24 December 2014 (UTC)

::Editing is pruning, not obliteration. Parroting the industry press release encrusts this article with barnacles, and obfuscates advancement.

::Again, we've two points of contention. The first is that the "the first step to reaching a 20 TB" drive capacity doesn't represent growth as well as areal density (platter capacity) does, because drive capacity is a vague metric. Areal density is discussed thoroughly elsewhere in this article. The second point is that we all know that the indefinite future is “unclear" or "an open question,” so this adds nothing to this article except clutter.

::#The relationship between areal density and maximum capacity is not "vague" but instead is reasonably correlated since the vendors are constrained by drefacto form factor standards and practical limits on head size and disk thickness.  IMO maximum capacity is far more meaningful to our readers than areal density so with the current maximum well established as about 8-10 TB a prediction by a reliable source of 20 TB by 2020; i.e. more or less doubling in more or less 5 years is reasonable information for the article.
::#While we all know exponential growth cannot go on forever, there are at least some observers predicting a return to 40% per year but most do not think so.  The sentence maybe a bit of a non-sequitor but the open question is whether growth will return to its previous high exponential rates, remain stable at a lower exponential rate or even perhaps cease being exponential.  At the present growth rate enough time has not passed to determine what sort of curve the technology is currently on, and of course there are lots of predictions of new technology causing the growth rate to increase.  So if u can come up with a better way of saying the future growth rate is unclear or an open question, please do so, but don't obliterate this summary of the current situation.

Capacity by itself, 20 TB in 2020, is so vague as to be meaningless, and that's what Seagate is aiming to do here: making a deliberately vague marketing claim.

:::::Can you provide a reference for one of those observers? No observer in the last year or so is predicting 40% per year. Hope for robust growth of 40% per year has faded now. Those were happier times; but now the reality of much slower growth has set in.

This article does not need to apologize for the cloudiness of our crystal ball [[wp:crystal]]. The article references numerous well-sourced areal density forecasts already, and their median is 20% per year. 
:::::3. How many platters can be crammed into a hard drive isn't relevant. As noted above ad nauseum, storage cost is related to areal density. Cramming more platters into a drive ratchets up drive cost in proportion to the number of platters. Therefore, how many platters are in the drive or how much capacity it has, is vague and largely irrelevant to storage cost per bit. In fact, over the long sweep of HDD history, both form factor and platter diameter have changed several times as evidenced by the phrases we use to describe them: full height, half height, one third height, 2.5 inch, 3.5 inch, etc. Obviously, this dooms drive capacity as a measure of advancement when the scope is more than a decade or two. The HDD industry knows this full well, and for this reason it uses areal density as a proxy for storage cost per bit, not drive capacity.

:::::: Umh, this was close to a case of tl;dr. :)  Well, it ''is'' important how many platters a drive can have, for one simple reason: the industry will never go back to 5.25-inch or full-height devices.  HDD consumers would want even smaller, not bigger form factors, which can store increasingly larger amounts of data; there's no point in having a full-height 3.5-inch HDD that stores the same amount of data as three regular 1/3-height 3.5-inch HDDs.  That's why drive capacity is important, and why it is directly related to the inevitable advancements in areal density.

{{od}}The reference does not track capacity over several decades. Still, the reference is good enough (satisfactory) to distinguish between advancement in areal density and storage capacity. It says that the latter does not improve cost, since adding more heads and media costs more: 

:"the average annual cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) in areal density is currently less than 20%. In order for HDDs to keep their $/GB or perhaps better nowadays, $/TB, advantage over other storage technologies they need to retain some rate of areal density growth.  Considering the growth in capacity of flash memory this probably needs to be about 40% CAGR in areal density.  There are other ways to increase storage capacity in a HDD, such as adding more heads and media but this adds additional costs and will not help in space constrained HDDs such as those introduced for ultra-thin notebook computers...   For these types of HDDs it is expected that soon there will be He-filled versions and perhaps shingled magnetic recording (SMR) versions of these drives that will be announced within the next year.  This will likely increase the capacity of 3.5-inch capacity enterprise HDDs to 6-8 TB."

For these reasons, the "first step to 20 TB" is misleading, because it allows more heads — perhaps even TDMR — and more platters (which don't improve storage cost), and should be removed or pruned.

But, SMR has been confined to an archival niche, and has not found widespread use in mainstream HDDs. Perpendicular recording is mainstream.

:Yes, SMR has limitations. Even so, capacity is still a vague measure, and very high areal density requires further technologies, further steps. You still haven't any published historical context for drive capacity, so 20 TB is meaningless.

However, I don't find that the note should be deleted per [[WP:UNDUE]] as it provides a slightly better insight into the SMR recording technology, which certainly has some drawbacks.  Also, I agree that it might be better not to compare it with SSDs, at least not until some in-detail public information becomes available.

== Drive capacity not correctly defined ==

While referring to this article, I noticed an omission. In modern drives capacity is actually specified not by the raw capacity of the drive in bytes, but by the number of blocks of size x the drive exports. The mapping between drive size and number of blocks is fond in an IDEMA standard document, [http://www.idema.org/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=1223 LBA Count for Disk Drives Standard ]. So, for example, a 500GB drive with 512 byte block size will report that it has 976,773,168 logical blocks. There will actually be more capacity than this in the drive to allow for block revectoring and other error handling, but to be a 500GB drive, this is the number of blocks the drive must report. 

I'm not certain exactly where this should go in the article, but it should be in there. My experience with this is as a firmware developer at Western Digital, where this was the standard used for the number of blocks reported by a drive. [[User:MisterSpecific|MisterSpecific]] ([[User talk:MisterSpecific|talk]]) 20:08, 14 February 2016 (UTC)

: Hello!  As we know, it's pretty much about the advertised vs. reported capacity of HDDs; the former is primarily advertised in gigabytes or terabytes, while the latter is reported in LBA blocks.  Please have a look at the {{Section link|Hard disk drive|Calculation}} section, which already describes the use of logical blocks; it also describes the presence of spare areas used for remapping bad sectors. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 20:28, 14 February 2016 (UTC)

:: Sorry {{ping|Dsimic}}, but I don't think it's about that. I've been buying hard drives since they were measured in tens of megabytes and as far as SCSI, ATA, and SATA drives go, I can't remember ever seeing the actual usable capacity (number of addressable blocks x block size) ''not'' exceed the drive's advertised capacity, albeit by a negligible amount. I'm traveling atm so I have few drives to cite as example... but right now this machine has a "1 TB" and a "2 TB" drive attached; the latter reports 3,907,029,168 blocks; at 512 bytes each this is 2,000,398,934,016 bytes. The advertised and reported capacities are identical within 0.02 percent, and the reported (usable) is the larger, though by a negligible amount. Neither of these is the "raw capacity" and this difference does not reflect the space reserved for spare sectors and the like. 
:: What {{ping|MisterSpecific}} is referring to (I believe) is the capacity of the disk ''as seen by its internal firmware''. This does include a number of blocks that are not addressable from the outside, but are reserved for use as spares and for other "internal" purposes. I do not beleive that, at least in SCSI, ATA, and later times, hard drive  makers have ever advertised drives in terms of this internal capacity. 
:: iirc there was a time in the past (when I was buying—and low-level-formatting—products like Fujitsu Eagles and CDC Wrens) when drives' "raw" capacities ''were'' regularly reported by manufacturers. But that was because the drives (in some variants, anyway) didn't have an internal controller that enforced formatting or implemented sparing; that was up to the external controller's firmware and/or the host OS. Thus the end-user usable capacity, the number of addressable blocks, actually depended on the choice of low-level format (like MFM vs RLL), the sector layout, etc. 
:: With the advent of SCSI and, slightly later, ATA drives, this went away; the drives came low-level-formatted from the factory and the end user could not re-do this, let alone change it. At that point the "raw" capacity was essentially meaningless to the end user other than as a measure of how much "sparing" capacity the drive had and was no longer advertised widely (or even in the fine print).

::: {{u|Jeh}}, I'd say that we're actually on the same page, and the only issue is that I erroneously used "vs." in my initial reply{{snd}} using "along" instead would fit much better up there.  In other words, it's all about expressing essentially the same drive capacity both in advertised and reported units.  Of course, drive firmware sees much more, not only the spare sectors, but also the ECC data, service areas, etc.  You're right that long time ago one could see and use the "raw" capacity of a drive, even the space intended for ECC data could be repurposed and used for storing user-accessible data. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 21:41, 14 February 2016 (UTC)

:::: I'll note that there was an edit conflict with the post above that moots some of what I say below, but not all of it, so I'll post it anyway. Ignore if you want. This last by {{ping|Dsimic}} gets it right, but there are subtleties to the number that matter, discussed below. [[User:MisterSpecific|MisterSpecific]] ([[User talk:MisterSpecific|talk]]) 22:25, 14 February 2016 (UTC)

:::: Well, {{ping|Jeh}}, the IDEMA spec does in fact have the calculated reported number exceeding the LBA number that you'd calculate for size nTB by 0.02% as you note. But that's not the point here; the point is that the software that looks at drive size queries the number of blocks (LBAs) the drive says it contains (through the SATA or SCIS command I forget at the moment), and this number is what the drive reports. The actual drive itself may have more blocks on the platters, but it is of size nTB as reported by this calculated number ''and that number is the usable capacity on the drive, regardless of internal capacity''. In the drives I'm familiar with, you cannot exceed that LBA, even if the drive does have more blocks on the surface. In fact, when manufacturers build drives, they use the same mechanicals for drives of different sizes, and one of the ways they reduce the drive size (say, from 3TB to 2TB) is to simply set up the firmware to report the smaller block count. There's more capacity on the surface, but you bought a 2TB drive, so that's the number it reports, and that's the largest LBA you can write to. (They do this to reduce manufacturing costs or balance inventory; they also do things like leave out platters or depopulate heads to reduce size). 
:::: So {{ping|Jeh}}, it's actually the inverse of what you're speculating; it's what the outside world sees as the drive LBA limit, regardless of what the firmware sees internally (which is presumably more than that number).   
:::: As another example of what I'm trying to get across, if you read the doc you'll see that drives that support Protection Information actually use 520 byte blocks, yet report the same capacity as a 512 byte block drive (through the number of LBAs) since the additional RAW capacity isn't available to the end user. This number is not about the internal capacity other than as a lower limit for a new drive.  
:::: And, to respond to {{ping|Dsimic}}, you are right in that this about reported vs. actual capacity; this is the standard for reporting the capacity in LBAs for a given advertised drive size. At the end of the day, it's this calculated and reported number that defines the size of the drive, not the raw capacity or potential capacity or any other number. Drive manufacturers use this number so that when they stamp 500GB on the drive, users know it will report 976,773,168 LBAs available. That's what makes it a 500GB drive.
:::: At the risk of confusing the discussion, if the drive has to do bad block replacement, it does it by pointing the LBA to a different physical block. The number of blocks reported as capacity by the drive doesn't change. The same is true if the number of available physical blocks drops below this number; you'll get errors on the LBAs that point to broken, not re-vectorable bad blocks, but the total number of LBAs reported won't change. So your 500GB drive might not be able to store 500GB anymore, but it's still a 500GB drive.(Note that manufacturers don't lie about the number of available blocks on new drives because that would be fraud). [[User:MisterSpecific|MisterSpecific]] ([[User talk:MisterSpecific|talk]]) 22:25, 14 February 2016 (UTC)

::::: Now I'm completely confused. I have no argument with any of the above. Nor do I see how anything I wrote was diagreeing, let alone "the inverse". Perhaps I was careless with terms. 
::::: What the outside world sees as the LBA limit gives a capacity very slightly larger than the "package label" capacity. We're all agreed on that, no?
::::: And the actual capacity of the media is in turn larger than that implied by LBA limit x block size. Yes? 
::::: How the drive achieves this, how much "actual" or "raw" capacity is needed to implement the "external" capacity, is a private matter between the drive's firmware and the media. No? 
::::: And you want the article to talk about the internal/actual/raw capacity, in addition to the advertised ("package") and the (slightly larger) end-user-available capacity? I have no objection there either. 
::::: It seems to me that this is a detail of the internal implementation. Which is useful to describe here, but doesn't really affect the end user. 
::::: Edge cases: Consider a drive series that uses two platters. In one model they have four heads accessing all four surfaces. In another model, with 3/4 the advertised capacity and  less than 3/4 the cost (because of course they charge you a premimum for the highest-capacity drive), they don't implement one of the surfaces. Do we claim that the "actual" or "raw" capacity of these two drives is the same? After all the media is the same; the only difference is in whether the firmware uses all of it. What about if the "smaller" drive doesn't have the head for the ignored surface? The media is still there... 
::::: I recall the "Wrenrunner" drives, which were the same hardware as the "Wren", but with about 5% of the innermost and outermost cylinders locked out in the firmware - "short stroking", achieving improved seek times at the cost of capacity. Would we say the "raw" capacities of these two drives are the same? (A friend of mine used to tell his clients: Just buy the bigger-and-cheaper one, and don't use all of it!)

{{outdent}}
We should probably start by rewriting the first sentence in the Capacity section:

"''The capacity of a hard disk drive, as reported by an operating system to the end user, is smaller than the amount stated by a drive or system manufacturer; this can be caused by a combination of factors: the operating system using some space, different units used while calculating capacity, or data redundancy.''"

First, I know of no case where user-inaccessible areas that exist for redundancy (error correction codes are "redundancy") or for sparing are included in the advertised drive capacity. "Redundancy" is not mentioned in the section at all beyond this sentence. 

Second, "different units" does not cause actual errors of results, only errors of interpretation. 

Third, the capacity an OS reports may well be slightly larger than the advertised capacity, as we've already discussed. Of course it depends on where you look. If you look at the OS's report of maximum LBA you get one number which, as we've discussed, is slightly larger than the big round number on the drive box. If you look at the OS's report of capacity of a partition, even if that partition is as large as it can be for the drive, you get another, slightly smaller number (due to the MBR + the alignment requirement for the partition). If you look at the OS's report of the free space on a newly-created partition you get a number that is slightly smaller yet again, due to the space occupied by file system metadata. 

Here's a suggested rewrite:

"''The capacity of a hard disk drive, as reported by an operating system to the end user, will usually be different than the amount stated by a drive or system manufacturer. This can be caused by a combination of factors: The manufacturer "rounding down" from the actual capacity to the advertised capacity; overhead used by the partitioning scheme used; and overhead used by the operating system's file system.

: {{u|Jeh}}, your proposal for the opening sentence looks good to me, and I'd just tweak and expand the wording a bit so it ends up like this:
:: The usable capacity of a hard disk drive, as reported by operating system to the end user, is usually different than the capacity stated by the drive or system manufacturer.  This may be caused by a combination of factors: the drive manufacturer may be "rounding down" from the actual capacity to the advertised capacity, a certain amount of capacity overhead may be imposed by the partitioning scheme, or the overhead may be coming from the file system's on-disk metadata.  Additionally, operating systems may use slightly different meanings of "GB" or "TB" than the hard disk drive manufacturers, which results from the difference in decimal and binary meanings of those units.  Finally, the actual media inside the drive always has an internal raw capacity that is significantly larger than that available to the operating system, with the excess being used by the drive's firmware for different purposes, such as maintaining ECC data or providing space for the remapping of bad sectors.

::I mostly agree, except that there is a conflation between the way drives historically worked (drive vendors reporting different numbers based on their own ideas of what size the drive was) and they way they work now (using the IDEMA standard to report a standard drive size).  This modern approach makes {{ping|Dsimic}}'s statement in the expanded first line above misleading;  the drive manufacturers claim that a drive is 500GB because it tells you the drive addresses 976-odd million blocks, regardless of what's happening internally. So I'd modify the first line thusly:
::: The usable capacity of a hard disk drive, as reported by operating system to the end user, is usually different than the capacity stated by the drive or system manufacturer.  Modern drives report a standards-defined number<ref>http://www.idema.org/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=1223 LBA Count for Disk Drives Standard </ref> of Logical Block Addresses that the drive exports for a given capacity. However, this advertised capacity may be different than the OS reported capacity for a number of reasons: the drive manufacturer may be "rounding down" from the actual capacity to the advertised capacity, a certain amount of capacity overhead may be imposed by the partitioning scheme, or the overhead may be coming from the file system's on-disk metadata.  Additionally, operating systems may use slightly different meanings of "GB" or "TB" than the hard disk drive manufacturers, which results from the difference in decimal and binary meanings of those units. 
::: The actual media inside the drive typically has an internal raw capacity that is significantly larger than that available to the operating system, with the excess being used by the drive's firmware for different purposes, such as maintaining ECC data or providing space for the remapping of bad sectors.

::: Ah, now I get your point, {{u|MisterSpecific}}.  As an example, long time ago 9 or 18&nbsp;GB SCSI hard disk drives used to have slightly different numbers of sectors, which in many cases resulted in the need to use a 18&nbsp;GB drive when replacing a failed 9&nbsp;GB drive as part of a RAID set.  All that becuase of, say, a difference of a few thousand sectors, and the fact that RAID controllers used 100% of 9&nbsp;GB drives during the initial setup of a RAID set.  That was plain stupid.
::: I'd tweak the wording a bit further, so it reads as follows:
:::: The usable capacity of a hard disk drive, as reported by operating system to the end user, is usually different than the capacity stated by the drive or system manufacturer.  The design of modern drives follows an IDEMA's industry standard for reporting the number of logical block address (LBA) blocks for a specific advertised capacity, so all drives with the same advertised capacity report the same same number of LBA blocks.<ref>[http://www.idema.org/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=1223 LBA Count for Disk Drives Standard]</ref>  However, differences in advertised capacity and capacity reported by the operating system are caused by different reasons, including the following: the drive manufacturer may be "rounding down" from the actual capacity to the advertised capacity, a certain amount of capacity overhead may be imposed by the partitioning scheme, or the overhead may be coming from the file system's on-disk metadata.  Additionally, operating systems may use slightly different meanings of "GB" or "TB" than the hard disk drive manufacturers, which results from the difference in decimal and binary meanings of those units.

::::: Linux [[mdadm]] [http://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm man page] could be used as another reference, here's a quote from it:
:::::: Sometimes a replacement drive can be a little smaller than the original drives though this should be minimised by IDEMA standards. Such a replacement drive will be rejected by md. To guard against this it can be useful to set the initial size slightly smaller than the smaller device with the aim that it will still be larger than any replacement.
::::: For a table of standard capacities, we could use page 12 in the [ftp://ftp.seagate.com/sff/SFF-8447.PDF#page=12 SFF-8447] document as a reference, which also says this on page 9:
:::::: For interchangeability of storage devices in some systems, the advertised capacity of the storage device needs to be associated with the same LBA count for products from different suppliers. This specification defines the standard method for determining the LBA count for disk drives. This specification defines the functions to calculate the LBA count using the advertised capacity, logical block size, and inclusion of SCSI Protection Information.

:::::: Does anyone know if the IDEMA spec is literally followed by each of the three remaining manufacturers in all of their products?  It maybe that they intepret the calculated number of blocks for a given advertised capacity as a minimum number and not a precise number.  Be that as it may, I think the proposed changes may have gotten so far into the weeds so as to me unitelligible to the average reader.  If we prioriitized the causes of discrepancies between system reported capacity to the EU versus manufacturers advertised capacity to the EU, wouldn't it be something like this in pareto order
::::::#Some OSes use different numbering systems (the binary prefix issue)
::::::#Some system vendors use hidden partitions
::::::#File system and operating system overhead
::::::#Rounding residuals differing between models that are left over in rounding down to the advertised capcity from the number of reported blocks of data, now maybe solved by an IDEMA standard.
::::::Actually I sort of like the IDEMA definition of actual capacity = number of blocks times bytes per block, which  is now a 9 or 10 digit number.  How this is tranformed into an EU number is different for OSs and System/OEM mfgrs and that's why the numbers rarely agree.  For the readers sake, I'd like to see the definition restructured beginning with all expressions start from the same value and then explain in rank order how the descrepancies have arisen.  If I have some time maybe I will take a hack at it.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 22:42, 16 February 2016 (UTC)

:::::::{{ping|Dsimic}}, regarding "Do all vendors use the IDEMA numbers?", I can speak only to Western Digital; they did while I was there (2011-2014). I can say that I spent some time looking at drives from other vendors which seemed to follow this standard as well. I know that the (proprietary) specs for drives to be OEMed by major hardware vendors all required the IDEMA LBA-count spec be followed (using the exact IDEMA number). I will check online with the various vendors to see if they say one way or the other that they follow the specs. 
:::::::{{ping|Tom94022}}, I like the refactoring for the "Why the hell doesn't my OS say the same capacity number as my drive manufacturer?" reasons. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen this particular rant on places like Amazon and Newegg for people that have bought drives (it's a personal bugaboo, I must say). The first reason you list is the big one - the GiB vs. GB translation factor. It might be good to give a concrete example for this one - say, I bought a 128GB drive and my OS says it's only 119GB, how come? 128GB as specified by the drive vendor is 128*1000*1000*1000 bytes, where the OS calls out the capacity in GiB (although it calls them GB), which are 128*1024*1024*1024. 128*10**9 divided by 1GiB (1073741824 bytes) is 119.2GiB, wrongly labelled as 119GB.[[User:MisterSpecific|MisterSpecific]] ([[User talk:MisterSpecific|talk]]) 00:27, 17 February 2016 (UTC) 

::::::: After a little groveling about online, solid evidence that manufacturers comply with particular specs is probably going to have to come directly from the vendor. The specification sheets for the drives I've looked at don't even claim to meet the T-10 or T-11 spec sets (SCSI and SATA), so meeting this spec is probably even more difficult to unearth.[[User:MisterSpecific|MisterSpecific]] ([[User talk:MisterSpecific|talk]]) 00:27, 17 February 2016 (UTC)

:::::::: Agree completely with the above, esp the importance of addressing the GiB vs GB issue. A huge number of the complainers seem to think that just because RAM comes in sizes easily written as "a power-of-two integer multiplied by a power of 1024" that everything else in a computer must also, and that the drive makers are "cheating" by not complying. And no matter how well you document that there is nothing in a HD that requires, or even mildly encourages, a factor-of-1024-related size, most of them persist in this belief. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 00:36, 17 February 2016 (UTC)

::::::::: The binary vs. decimal prefixes issue is already very well covered in the article, so IMHO we shouldn't be focusing on it in this discussion.  Regarding how well the remaining drive manufacturers comply to the IDEMA numbers, well, by checking out some online drive specifications it seems that WD complies, while Seagate for some odd reason seems not to provide LBA counts in its drive specifications. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 03:00, 17 February 2016 (UTC)

== When were hard disks first called hard disks? ==

I believe that until microcomputers started to become common in the late 1970s and early 1980s, hard disks were called "disks", not "hard disks". I believe the terms "hard disk" and "hard disk drive" are [[retronym]]s to disambiguate from the newly-ubiquitous floppy disk and floppy disk drive. If this is correct, it is misleading for the article to say, as it does now, "Hard disk drives were introduced in 1956 as data storage for an IBM ..." as I strongly doubt that the term "hard disk drive" was used until at least a decade later. —[[User:Anomalocaris|Anomalocaris]] ([[User talk:Anomalocaris|talk]]) 07:48, 22 February 2016 (UTC)

: Your recollection matches mine, and furthermore the mainframe and minicomputer industry didn't start calling them "hard drives" until long after the personal computer industry had. In that universe they were simply "disk drives" (vs. "floppy drives"); since hard drives came first there was no confusion among the buyers. However the sentence you're objecting to can be fixed with four words at the beginning: "What are now called ..." It's not as if it's a major error in the article. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 08:21, 22 February 2016 (UTC)

:: [[User:Jeh|Jeh]]: I agree that it's not a major error in the article. However, I think the article should say when the terms "Hard disk", "Hard Disk Drive", and "HDD" began to be used, and what these things were called before that, and avoid the impression that the term "hard disk drive" was in use in 1956. —[[User:Anomalocaris|Anomalocaris]] ([[User talk:Anomalocaris|talk]]) 08:56, 22 February 2016 (UTC)

::: It will likely be difficult to find a ref for exactly when the HDD name became commonly used throughout the industry, but it shouldn't be too hard to document "disk drive" and similar from advertisements, archived manuals, and the like. Terminology evolution is an interesting part of many WP articles, esp (in my perception, anyway) tech-oriented ones. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 09:05, 22 February 2016 (UTC)

:Don't confuse the thing with its name. It's true that the '''term''' ''hard disk drive'' was coined in order to distinguish hard disk drives from floppy disk drives, but that term is applicable to devices that precede it, e.g., [[IBM 350]]. That said, I concur with the suggestion to explicitly state that the term is new. [[User:Chatul|Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul]] ([[User talk:Chatul|talk]]) 18:05, 22 February 2016 (UTC)

== Near-term Development ==

There should be a mention of the move towards filling drives with helium.  This will likely make temporary repairs for recovery rather more difficult (needing to replace the helium, plus having to replace seals and the seals will likely be harder to open).  I also wonder about how well seals on such drives will be, will helium diffuse out and put a real upper limit on the lifetime of such drives?

Actually working with a gas filled item is not very hard at all you just get a flexible container (Bag) of the gas to surround it and work inside the bag so there is no need to worry about contamination. I first noticed this trick used in an old Elron Hubbard book "battlefield earth" but I have since seen it has been used for much longer than that in places where sensitive equipment must be opened in wet or dirty conditions.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/132.3.37.81|132.3.37.81]] ([[User talk:132.3.37.81|talk]]) 20:30, 2 September 2016 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Not according to most sources, see for example [[Memory_hierarchy#Application_of_the_concept|memory hierarchy, application of the concept]] which categorizes HDDs as [[Secondary_storage|secondary '''storage''']].  IMO use of the term memory to describe HDDs generically misplaces them in the hierarchy and is more liable to cause reader confusion than the use of storage.

== Standardized capacities? (aka: Actual vs. reported drive capacities yet again, but different) ==

The "1 TB" SSD on this machine provides... um, Windows won't give me the exact number in bytes, but it says 976746 MB. By MB they of course mean MiB. Multiply that by 1024 squared and I get 1,024,192,413,696 bytes, comfortably over the advertised "1 TB", even though Windows says it's 953.85 GB (which really means GiB). I get it. This section has nothing to do with decimal vs. binary prefixes. 

What I am interested in here is the difference between 1,000,000,000,000 and 1,024,192,413,696. My long experience is that the drive's actual capacity, that is, its number of logical blocks multiplied by the block size, has ''always'' - no exceptions IME - been slightly ''more than'' the advertised capacity. Note that this particular SSD's spec sheet claims it provides "1024 GB", and that "GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes", and the actual capacity here is slightly more than even that, by almost 200 MB. 

This point, that the actual capacity of a hard drive is slightly greater than its advertised capacity, is not reported in the article. 

This can be relevant when drives are aggregated in e.g. RAID arrays. Most such configurations can only use the smallest common capacity of all drives in the array. Maybe one drive Suppose that in the past you built an array of 750 GB drives. The Seagate spec for one such drive says that they guarantee "1,465,149,168 sectors". That's 750,156,374,016 bytes. Now suppose one of them failed. You had to go out and find a replacement drive of the exact same model, or one of greater capacity, or else it might not have enough to match the rest of your array. If your new drive had a little less capacity than the existing drives in the array, you were screwed. 

A RAID controller I used to use did have an option to round the drives' capacity down to the next even gigabyte. So my RAID array would then use exactly 750,000,000,000 of each "750 GB" drive, and they could all be different sizes but all a little larger than that, and that extra would just be ignored. Since the extra is a tiny fraction of the total capacity, losing it was a fair tradeoff for not worrying about exact drive capacities. 

A few months or years or eons ago, someone on this talk page - I believe it was {{ping|Tom94022}} - mentioned that due to this need to aggregate drives into e.g. RAID arrays, and the fact that such arrays usually require all drives to have the same capacity, the industry had adopted a set of standard exact drive sizes, specified down to the block. So when you bought a "4 TB" you were getting the exact same capacity, down to the block, no matter what model of drive it was. 

Is there a table in a RS of these standardized drive sizes? [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 05:23, 1 April 2017 (UTC)
:As far as I can recall the issue came up in the [[Binary Prefix]] article and referenced some IDEMA publication which had definitions for TB and GB that were neither binary nor decimal.

:'''Comment''': I think that we need to seriously think about what we intend to mean by 'hard drive'. A [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) is commonly referred to as being a 'hard drive' but is definitely not the same as a HDD (this [http://uk.pcmag.com/storage-devices-reviews/8061/feature/ssd-vs-hdd-whats-the-difference article] makes the distinction quite nicely). Potentially we need to think about splitting out elements from both SSD and HDD to create a new article just entitled 'hard drive' and then retaining SSD and HDD as more technical articles.

* '''Oppose''' both the move and Ebonelm's approach.  Note the article cited by Ebonelm uses HDD as a synomnym for hard drive.  "Hard drive" currently redirects to "Hard disk drive;"  I suggest we simply change the redirect into a disabiguation page. IMO there is no need in the foreseeable future for a separate "Hard disk" article.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 18:00, 2 July 2017 (UTC)

== Include SSD to compare in form factor section? ==

I added SSD info, that was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hard_disk_drive&diff=804911054&oldid=804707599 reverted] by {{U|Tom94022}}.

I'm not saying an SSD is a [[magnetic disk|disk]]/HDD/"spinning round [[disk_(mathematics)|disc]] of rust", just adding so that people can compare. However to most people, they don't care (but do on cost..) if it's a disk/disc or not, but want to know if it fits in and has compatible interface.

I not there hatnote at the top (and SSD compared to HDD in the lead):

'''Hard drive''' may also refer to:

:Hard drive can be ambiguous particularly when viewed thru an OS an HDD and an SSD are supported by the same software, see also [[Talk:Hard_disk_drive#Requested_move_30_June_2017|Section 2 above]].  HDD is much less ambiguous.  This is an HDD article so including SDD is inconsistent with the articles subject.  Furthermore "Form factor" applies to many devices including floppy disk, tape, optical disk and others so just adding SSDs to the table is an inconsistancy.    {{U|comp.arch}} perhaps displays some bias and age when he refers to HDDs as "spinning round [[disk_(mathematics)|disc]] of rust" - the industry stopped using gamma iron oxide in the early 1990s :-).  The place to note compatiblity to SATA interface and various Form Factors is in the SDD article not the HDD article (which BTW was not accomplished by including it in the table).

== ''real-time transaction processing computer''? ==

== Older interface cables ==

[[User:Wtshymanski]] insists upon this statement which is incorrect in several ways:
{{quote box
|quote=Older interfaces (such as for the [[ST-506]] disk drive) had separate cables for '''analog''' data signals '''to''' a '''data separator on the controller card''', and for drive control control signals that positioned the head." ('''emphasis added''')
|width=70% |align=center}}
#The data signals on the data cable of the ST-506 and other such interfaces are binary not analog and there are other signals on the cable that are binary and digital.
#The cables sent sent signals to and from the drive.
#Not all older interfaces had a data separator in the controller; notably Diablo, SMD and ESDI drives contained data separators, so citing ST-506 characteristics without clarification is misleading.
Going into this much detail seems TMI so I propose the simple and true sentance now in the article:
{{quote box
|quote=Older interfaces had separate cables for data signals and for drive control signals.
|width=70% |align=center}}
It avoids all of the above issues; any other simple constuction would be appropriate but an incorrect and misleading sentance should not be allowed [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 23:04, 21 November 2017 (UTC)
: This is Wikipedia, the HOME of TMI. We go into everything but the screw hole thread specs so one sentence explaining the difference of the "old days" is hardly too much information.  There is a huge difference between the ST506 style interface (in particular) and modern all-digital, block-oriented,  "smart" drive interfaces.  (The ST 506 approach was more like telling the printhead when to fire the pins and when to move the paper, as opposed to just sending an "A" down the wire.) The "sentence" is correct - the difference is the data separator was on the controller card, not part of the drive. The signals were not nice clean 1's and 0's and required considerable analog processing at the controller to turn into binary data. If anyone needs to know all the pinouts, we've got them in the linked [[ST-506]] article.  The importance for this article is to stress how modern drives have off-loaded the details of disk control from the host. --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 00:28, 22 November 2017 (UTC)

The data separator is only one small piece of what was moved from the controller and so it is incorrect to ifocus on it and thereby imply that all older interfaces had a data separator in a controller.  What about the ECC encoder/decoder, serializer/deserialiser, formatter/deformatter and the write encoder/precomensator and the read decoder.  SMD which preceeded ST-506 is just one example of an HDD with a data separator in the drive and it was just as dominant in its time period as the ST-506 was in its time period.  All of the signals on the ST-506 data cable were in fact nice clean 1's and 0's - you don't have to believe me - from the MFM article,
 [[Modified_Frequency_Modulation| "MFM is a modification to the original '''digital''' FM ('''digital''' frequency modulation also known as delay coding) scheme for encoding data ..."]] ('''emphasis added''').  
::The signals on the data cable other than the read signals were noise free digital; the read signals were digital with noise in the transitions.  It is just plain wrong to call them analog - they are analog at the head and all drives convert them to digital. 
::I don't have a problem with a longer sentance containing more informationbut if we are going to generalize the earlier interfaces it needs to be accurate, something along the lines of:
:::The earlier interfaces had a separate data cable to transfer bit serial data to/from the device and its controller with the controller containing both the write circuits necessary to convert parallel data from the host into bit serial data to the drive and the read circuits necessary to convert bit serial data from the drive into parallel data to the host; in intelligent drives all this circuitry is moved from the controller to the drive, sending both data and control over one cable and eliminating the need for a data cable.  

::This seems like TMI but it is accurate, so if you want to try to improve the article go ahead, but please be accuate.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 08:23, 22 November 2017 (UTC)

:: Please look at the connectors for [[Enhanced_Small_Disk_Interface|ESDI]] - the signals are more or less the same as ST-506 '''but''' an ESDI drive has the data separator in the drive.  It is not an "intelligent" interface as u define it.  This is perhaps the best example I can give as to why the challenged edit is at best misleading.

:::ST-506 is not ESDI.  So if ST5-6 was sending digital data to the controller, why did they move the data separator in ESDI? --[[User:Wtshymanski|Wtshymanski]] ([[User talk:Wtshymanski|talk]]) 19:05, 22 November 2017 (UTC)
::::Sure ESDI is not exactly ST506 but it is very close; if you compare the interfaces ESDI is a superset of ST506; the interfaces are physically identical  and the common signals are logically the same except that the data rate is up to 20 MHz NRZ rather than 5 MHz MFM (or 7.5 MHz for ST-412HP).  There wer a lot of bad data separators so the ANSI committee dominated by drive companies required noiseless read signals to avoid compatibility problems. Moving the data separator did not make ESDI intelligent (just less dumb) nor did it eliminate the data cable.  Digital signals can have phase noise but they are still digital.
::::BTW there are 5 signal pins in the ST-506 data cable, three are noiseless and two are noisy, +MFM Read and -MFM Read.  So your phrase "analog data signals" is at best misleading since three of the five data signals on the data cable are noise free digital.
::::Perhaps you might try to explain why you are ignoring all the other functions left on the controller that operated thru the data cable and just focusing on the data separator.  FWIW, having designed many controllers, the data separator is a small part of the development effort.  [[User:Tom94022|Tom94022]] ([[User talk:Tom94022|talk]]) 21:34, 22 November 2017 (UTC)
