== Continuous quantity ==

It seems to me that "continuous quantity" is not a common phrase, at least not in the mathematics books I see that talk about real numbers.  I was wondering:

# Is there is any good reference in a contemporary book for the term "continuous quantity"? In particular, in a book that is not about history or statistics? 
# As we all know, there are some quantities in physics that are measured with complex numbers, rather than real numbers. Are these not "continuous quantities" as well?  It seems to me that the identification of real numbers with continuous quantities only works when continuous quantities themselves are identified as signed magnitudes on the real line, at which point the first sentence here might as well cut out the middleman. But this takes us back to #1.

:*I still think that referring to the "real line", with or without [[real line|link]], in the first sentence, as kind of "introduction" for the notion of reals, is a logical flaw of circularity. I am convinced that there must be abundant citations about reals forming "the" or "a" continuum, a term I would prefer to talking about "continuous quantity". I am averse to using the term "measurement" in connection with reals, even when I disagree that physicist make measurements of "complex numbers". All these mathematical constructs are just models in the physicist's worlds.
:: Here is my effort to contribute to the discussion:
 Real numbers are mathematical constructs, defined in a way that satisfy most needs in arbitrary continua. They may/can be envisioned as distances or points on a line.

@Purgy: as Trovatore says, people measured distances along lines for a long time, so there is no circularity in saying that this is one thing that real numbers can measure.  Your "very bold" edit included the phrase "quantity along a line" which has, as far as I can tell, no meaning at all.  The thing that real numbers measure along a line is distance, not some unnameable "quantity along". 

But my question still stands: is there any modern source that defines continuous quantity? If not, I think we should avoid it in the first sentence as an overly specialized term. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 12:25, 10 May 2018 (UTC)

Related to being bold - bold edits are good when they work towards consensus.  On this page (previous section), several people have indicated they are in favor of talking about the real line as a way of understanding the real numbers, so simply ''removing'' references to the line is not likely to work towards consensus.  It's also worth remembering that the first sentence of the article is not ''constructing'' the real numbers -- it is not talking about Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences, etc.  Instead it is trying to ''identify'' the real numbers, so the reader knows what we are talking about. That kind of identification may well have some circularity to it. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 12:34, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
:The mention of a line in the first sentence is a reference to a mental representation (intuitive representation). Even if this mental representation is commonly accepted, there is no reason to impose it to everybody in the first sentence of an article. On the other hand, it should be useful to say ''why'' the concept has been introduced, and why real numbers are not simply called numbers. Therefore I suggest for the first sentence:
::{{tq|'''Real numbers''' are the [[mathematics|mathematical formalization]] of the non-integer [[number]]s, which are of everyday use.}}
:This proposal is a first draft, that may and should be improved. In particular, I do not like the use of "non-integer". [[User:D.Lazard|D.Lazard]] ([[User talk:D.Lazard|talk]]) 12:59, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
::That's a good idea to think about. I would replace "integer" with "rational", since that is the bigger leap (cf. the history behind the irrationality of the square root of 2).  The other thing is to get a phrasing that does include the integer and rational numbers among the real numbers.  One challenge is finding a sentence that does not apply to the complex numbers just as well (e.g. measurable quantities, continuous quantities). How to do that without referring to a line is something to think about. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 13:49, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
:::I think we should hold the line on "line".  That's how the reals are typically introduced to children, and for once it's an excellent choice.  The ancients weren't disturbed about the irrationality of &radic;2 for ''algebraic'' reasons &mdash; if they had been, they would have just said, OK, 2 doesn't have a square root, maybe surprising, but that's how it is.  But they could see that there ''had'' to be a square root of 2, because it was the length of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with unit side.

::::: There's a linguistic or rhetorical infelicity in defining the reals in terms of the "real line", not really a ''logical'' circularity I think, but it definitely doesn't sound good.  I hadn't realized that was the sticking point for you.  I agree that "line" is better than "real line".

:::::As for defining "real number" in terms of "number", no, I don't like that at all.  "Number" is a very fuzzy word; means all sorts of things.  Defining "real number" in terms of "number" is a ''much worse'' circularity than defining it in terms of "line".
:::::"Line" also means all sorts of things, but I think most readers have come across the Euclidean concept &mdash; a line is infinitely thin (that is, zero-width), infinitely long in both directions, consists of points of zero size, and has no holes in it.  That description is enough to make the reals well-specified, with a couple of quibbles.  That's the concept we should be starting with. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 17:50, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
:::::: IMO, "of everyday use" excludes the complexes for everybody. By the way, a reader who knows of the complexes knows enough mathematics for not needing any explanation of what are the reals. Thus we do not have to take care of the complexes in this sentence. Here, understandability by the layman is much more important than logical and mathematical correctness. As "fuzzy words" are not really a problem for the layman, if he think understand them, they are not a problem here. [[User:D.Lazard|D.Lazard]] ([[User talk:D.Lazard|talk]]) 18:02, 10 May 2018 (UTC)

Their most salient distinguishing feature is their ''topology'', which is what we should be trying to get across (informally) right up front.  Just because you're comfortable with &minus;1 having a square root doesn't mean you've thought about the topology of the reals. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 18:20, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
::::::: May I point to the effort of avoiding introducing "reals" as "numbers", but instead as a "formalization" of something in "everyday use", similar to the notion of "line" in this here context.

:Here are a few thoughts:
::1. The real numbers are not a "formalization". There are formalizations ''of the real numbers'' but the real numbers themselves are not a formalization, unless every mathematical object is somehow a formalization (in which case there's no reason to mention it). 
::2. Saying that the real numbers "round off the numbers" does not make sense to me. "Round off" means to round a number to an approximation, i.e. we can round off &pi; to 3.1. 
::3. The word "number" on its own does not have much meaning.  It could mean an ordinal number, surreal number, natural number, or many other things.

::: And here some more:
::# Reals ARE a formalization of an indeed very abstract idea, and the reason for mentioning this here is not that math is about ''formalization'', but here it is exactly about "''the formalization that ...''" Roughly: I do not believe in real numbers in any philosophical reality, besides as reals-in-themselves, they are no measurements, neither real nor complex, ...
::# I humbly ask for linguistic help in finding the right wording for the meaning of "completion", which I had in mind, and wanted to circumscribe in a most accessible way by "round off".

:::: Purgy, for question 2, I think the idiomatic phrase you want is "rounding out," rather than "rounding off."

::::<br>The reals are not a "formalization" of anything.  They aren't ''formal'' in the first place.  I'm not sure what you're trying to say, exactly, but "formalization" is definitely the wrong word.
::::I thought maybe you wanted to say that they're an "idealization" &mdash; that is, you start with a messy group of empirical observations, and you abstract out an underlying idea, one that perhaps none of the observations ''exactly'' match, but which simplifies discussing what they have in common.
::::But then I noticed you say they're a "formalization" of a "very abstract idea" (what idea?) so maybe you actually want the other direction from idealization &mdash; say, "realization" or "instantiation".

::::: Again I oppose: I hold dear that mathematicians, talking about reals, do talk about formal objects from the formalization of an idea, and I am convinced that a large majority of potential readers consider this very idea (take any construction of reals out there) a "highly abstract one". I do not want to enter the philosophical realm discussing whether numbers are a realization or an abstraction. I do admit that a certain axiomatic system describing/generating(?) the reals is one "realization" or "instantiation" of them, but I think discussing a meta-equivalence of axiomatic systems for the reals-in-themselves is way beyond the scope of this article. The category of "is an idealization" is similar to "is beautiful" and not in my focus here. Maybe I could get some consent against your categorical {{tq|But "formalization" is definitely not it.}} from {{u|D.Lazard}}, it was ''not me'', who introduced {{tq|'''Real numbers''' are the [[mathematics|mathematical formalization]] of the non-integer [[number]]s, which are of everyday use.}} as a first draft. I just consider this a good approach, and tried to work upon:

:::::::You must not confuse "formal theories" with [[formal system]]s. "Formal" and "formalization" have been used in mathematics a long time before the introduction of the first formal systems. This being said, I agree that, ''formally'', this is not the reals that are a ''formalization'', this is the concept of reals, which was ''formalized'' by the introduction by Dedekind and others of a ''formal definition'' (many occurrences of ''formal'', I assume them even I have no formal definition of them :-). Thus a ''formally correct'' first sentence would be "The concept of real number is a formalization ...". However, such a formulation would be a little pedantic for the first sentence of the lead, and "The real numbers are a formalization ..." seems acceptable, as, for users of mathematics, mathematics is essentially a formalization of the methods of [[modelization]]. <small><span class="autosigned">—[[User:D.Lazard|D.Lazard]] ([[User talk:D.Lazard|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/D.Lazard|contribs]]) 09:08, 12 May 2018 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Signing-->

What exactly that ''means'' is really a topic for a philosophy-of-math article more than for this one, though the reals are an interesting enough dividing line (there are people who are realist about the natural numbers but formalist about the reals, for example) that some discussion might not be out of place.

::::::I don’t think mentioning the idea of “formalization” in the first sentence, is the right way to go here. For me, the most basic property of real numbers is that they measure distance along a line. This is born out, it seems to me, by the historical development of what a number is. Euclid, for example, ''identified'' numbers with line segments. So where we would say "x is a multiple of y", he would say "the line segment x is measured by the line segment y". It was the (shocking!) discovery that not every pair of line segments had a common measure (i.e. that their ratio was not always a rational number), that pushed the idea of number beyond rational numbers, in the first place.

== In the Princeton Companion ==

I thought it might be good to look at a couple sources.  In the ''Princeton Companion to Mathematics'' (edited by [[Timothy Gowers]]), they motivate the real numbers by examples such as the square root of two. Then they say (informally) "The real numbers can be thought of as the set of all numbers with a finite or infinite decimal expansion".  Would that be a reasonable way for us to proceed here?  I also found at least one calculus book that gives the same characterization.  This seems like a different way to avoid any awkward "continuous quantity" phrasing, and it has the benefit of being sourced to a high quality publication.  &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 13:58, 10 May 2018 (UTC)

I am perfectly fine with referring to the real number line as the model for the real numbers; I was suggesting the decimal option as a possible alternative, but I don't really have a preference. I spent a few minutes looking at elementary algebra books, and they seem to either use the real line or decimals as their way to explain the set of real numbers. (As for privileging base 10 numbers, I think that may be a lost cause for a general audience article, unless there is still any society that uses non-base-10 in their everyday affairs.)

Another interesting discussion of the reals is to be found in the historical note to Bourbaki's General Topology, Volume 1, Section IV, which begins thus: "Every measurement of quantities implies a vague notion of real numbers."  The line is scarcely mentioned in their historical discussion.  (With some irony, I note that this was very closely connected to [[User:D.Lazard]]'s point raised in the previous thread.  Perhaps it's a French thing?)  It's not clear that this gives us any good insights into how the first sentence of the article should be written, but I think the rest of the lead should focus at least somewhat on measurement and less on the real line per se.

== Real numbers and "the line" ==

I think that [[User|Trovatore]] is very wrong on this issue, which has occupied the last few talk sections, and in which he has been an active disputant.  But he's not alone in this error -- he's just expressing an orthodoxy that has been drummed into several generations of high school and college students, at least in the US. I'm picking on him because he has defined his position so succinctly above, i.e., because he writes well. In particular, he has said above that
: The line is the underlying notion and is intuitively well-specified. The ancients understood what it was; they just didn't know how to work with it. You don't need the reals to specify what the line is. When you have the concept of the line, and elaborate it in the only possible correct way, you will necessarily recover the reals.

This is gibberish. In the first place, what does he mean by "intuitively well-specified?" Whose intuition his he referring to here? His? Mine? Yours?

I agree with keeping the geometric line in the lede description for "real number"---it has an intuitive feel for much of the reading lay public. But my guess is, the typical lay reader will ''not'' have any (good) intuitive feeling for the phrase "continuous quantity"; in fact, he/she will likely suffer a 'lost cause' or 'eyes-glaze-over' feeling upon encountering it. The linked ''(C-class)'' page 'Quantity' doesn't read in 'lay terms' until the last section---[[quantity#Further examples]]---for what it's worth; and there is no lay explanation in the article of any connection to real numbers.

Even I, long of a technical/engineering career, cannot relate to a singular "number" itself being described as a "continuous quantity"---algebraic variables excluded. That is, here the phrase seems to imply: the ''set of all real numbers'', rather than ''<U>a</u>''(one) real number. It's  doubtful the phrase "continuous quantity" has any knowledge recognition among the lay public, and the linked page [[Quantity]]---which is chiefly concerned with describing & measuring variables of multitude or magnitude, [[continuum]] or [[discontinuity]]---does not speak to the phrase orto real numbers.

I offer the following for your consideration:

*(Current) In [[mathematics]], a '''real number''' is a value of a [[quantity|continuous quantity]] that can represent a distance along a [[line (geometry)|line]].

*(alt-A) In [[mathematics]], a '''real number''' is a value that can represent distance along a straight, continuous line, or [[line (geometry)|geometric line]].

*(alt-B) In [[mathematics]], a '''real number''' is the value of a distance along a straight, continuous line, or [[line (geometry)|geometric line]], from the zero point to a given point of the line. 

''A follow-on descriptive sentence might read''> 

*Among its other properties, a real number takes either positive or negative values; it will be either a rational or irrational number, and not a complex number.

Both alternatives have the advantage that the reader can ignore linking to "geometric line" and still have an intuitive feel for:   ".. a distance along a straight, continuous line". Thanks, [[User:Jbeans|Jbeans]] ([[User talk:Jbeans|talk]]) 03:07, 17 May 2018 (UTC)

:A real number takes values? No, it is not a variable nor function, it does not take values; each real number ''is'' a value.

:More important point: we understand why we emphasize distances along a line, but some readers do not (I guess). They are puzzled: just distances on a line? Not distances on the plane, or space? Not areas and volumes? Not angles? Not masses, voltages etc? I'd say, the first phrase cannot just say "what is a real number?" (this is desirable, of course; but maybe impossible); rather, it should introduce the reader into the distinction between "practical" idea of numbers (approximate, subtleties aside) and "theoretical" idea of numbers (continuum, irrationals etc).

:: As said, I am a fan of using an informal notion of a line as guiding paradigm to the notion of the reals, but am rather skeptic about all the epitheta like continuous, straight, geometric, ... and especially "real". While I mostly agree to the above arguments, I find not much of an improving move in the suggestions. 

:: Wholesale, I think that it is helpful to tell the readership that the real numbers are not very real (in the sense of 'physically manifest') in the real (in the sense of 'as encountered') world. Real numbers exist in the way they do exactly to satisfy (most) mathematicians' needs for rigor, so that they can be used without bothering about exceptions and quirks (irrational, constructible, algebraic, computable, transcendental, ???).
:: I.e., I like to start saying that reals can be (vaguely) found along a line or in other measurements, and that their overall usefulness abounds, in spite of the next, that their accessibility results from one of several "unwieldy realizations" of highly abstract and partly unintuitive ideas (the history, leading to the reals should be told).

:::True. Abstractions are a half of the truth. The second half, I'd say. And here is the first half of the truth: real numbers are all (integer or not) positive and negative numbers (and zero), widely used as possible results of measurements (geometric, physical, etc). For some readers, this is enough. Others turn to the second half. By the way: is the (rational!) number 1+10<sup>-1000</sup> a possible result of a physical measurement? This naive question can be a kind of a bridge from the first part of the truth to the second part. Possible values versus possible results of measurement (of, say, a distance, or a volume, or a mass); the same or not the same?

::::Response to: Boris Tsirelson, Purgy, (rather than require chasing ''intercalations'' all over the place):

::::R1---Agree; the text of the follow-on sentence can be adjusted, such as:

::::*Among its other properties, a real number is either a positive or negative value; it can be either a rational or irrational number, but not a complex number.

::::R2---re improvements, there are two chiefly---proposed by both alternatives: {One} The link to [[Quantity]] (with its phrase "continuous quantity") ''should be dropped for cause'' <u>that the discussion there does not describe any relationship</u> between "real number" and"continuous quantity" (Pls, don't presume it's just fine---read for yourself). Neither is "real number" actually discussed in the linked article---it is mentioned only 3 times in 3 separate sections. (All this reading for no good explanation of the subject  is simply harmful in terms of reaching (and informing) the lay reader.) ...  {Two} New specific text is added, saying a real number can be visualized as:   "distance on a straight, continuous line" (which is both a phrase and a geometric form ''that a maximal number of the lay public relates to'', very worthwhile because---the need is: make the discussion accessible tothe lay reader). Citing this particular geometric form (a straight line) does not offend the value of other forms that contain real numbers---it merely  takes best advantage of what's already out there and provides an efficient, intuitive connection to the lay public.

::::Either one of the proposed alternatives plus the 'follow-on' sentence would serve the lay reader much better than the current lede sentence. Regards,[[User:Jbeans|Jbeans]] ([[User talk:Jbeans|talk]]) 13:48, 19 May 2018 (UTC)

==In conclusion, re "the line" ==
Fellow editors, please review my two recent posts---they are in the section immediately above---regarding my two recommendations that follow. Please note the current lede sentence:

*"In [[mathematics]], a '''real number''' is a value of a [[quantity|continuous quantity]] that can represent a distance along a [[line (geometry)|line]]."

I offer my ''concluding arguments for editing this sentence''---as the following:

Page-article "[[Quantity]]" and particularly its phrase "[[quantity|continuous quantity]]"---as (nominally) discussed in that page---is faulty and unhelpful: 1) ''in that the article fails'' to inform the reader re the actual subject, ie, a "real number" as a "continuous quantity"; 2) it fails to make any meaningful connection between the two concepts; 3) and thus it is unhelpful to the lay person reading Wp and attempting  to learn the basic parameters of real numbers; 4) the lay public ''does not'' have an intuitive grasp of any mathematical concept of "continuous quantity"---nor is the concept explained very well in Wp. ::::  IMO, the (proposed) phrase "distance along a straight, continuous line" provides the most intuitive feel (for grasping the concept of "real number") to the largest number of the lay public.

Therefore, for a better description of "real number", I move that the ''current'' lede sentence be replaced with ''new lede and second sentences'', as follows:

*In [[mathematics]], a '''real number''' is a value that can represent distance along a straight, continuous line, or [[line (geometry)|geometric line]]. A real number is either a positive or negative value; it can be either a rational or irrational number, but not a complex number. 
{'' Here the current text continues''; and note, the phrase "geometric line", immediately above, is presented in apposition to the phrase "a straight, continuous line", and they are not redundant. }

Editors, please reply to both points, pro or con. Particularly---if you have found in "[[Quantity|Quantity/continuous quantity]]", some specific text that helps the lay reader to better understand real numbers---''I will be most grateful if you would please'' identify the text you see. (Please do not offer the [[John Wallis]] blokequote [[quantity #Background|re ratios of magnitudes as real numbers, as here]]. Thanks & grins).

:No, this change would make the opening sentence significantly worse.  "straight, continuous line, or geometric line" doesn't really make much sense.  How can a line be not straight? or not geometric?  What's a continuous line?  Trying to cram in stuff about positive and negative, rational or irrational, and complex numbers so quickly isn't a very good approach either.  The current opening paragraph already eases into the rest more gently.  &ndash;[[User:Deacon Vorbis|Deacon Vorbis]]&nbsp;([[User Talk:Deacon Vorbis|carbon]]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Deacon Vorbis|videos]]) 03:37, 23 May 2018 (UTC)
:Add: on second thought, some sort of rewording to make it clear that negative numbers are included might be good (a distance is often taken to be positive only, as the current version states).

:<br>I'm just going to pick on one little point, without commenting yet on the rest of the proposal.  That is that I see no particular reason to mention a "straight" line.  A Euclidean line, of course, is straight, but that seems to have almost nothing to do with its connection to the reals; a curvy line would do just as well.  So at the very least I would leave that word out. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 04:30, 23 May 2018 (UTC)

To me, the list by Boris Tsirelson indicates that it is not easy to find something better, and my preference of defaming the reals as something abstractly engineered, at least a little bit, has not changed. Negatives yes, complexes no, straight, geometrical, continuous, "number lines", ... are all constructs way above the accessible math for the targeted readership, and partly of no obvious help at all.

It seems that no one is in favor that "straight, continuous line" be put (directly) before the reader. Regardless, please remember, <u>''two''</u> points were proposed; the 2nd was:

''that the link "[[Quantity|Quantity/continuous quantity]]" be deleted unless'',

* " Editors, please reply to both points, pro or con.

(See my previous post, closing paragraph).

To date, no comments, pro or con, have been posted re the 2nd point---which raises the question: ''Is there anyone who will <u>identify the text</u>'' where: the link "<u>continuous quantity</u>" clearly narrates (to the lay reader) a meaningful  connection to "real number"?

:@Jbeans, I do not think that the above discussion was targeted to express ''favor'' for some detail or linking of the status quo, but only shows ''no favor'' for any of your two suggestions, compared to this status. To me it is obvious that for the time being there is no agreed upon improvement visible.
:Re your final question, I tend to the opinion (please, refer also Boris Tsirelson's punctuation) that for the highly sophisticated real numbers there might be no "clearly '''narrating'''" text available at all, but just some motivation leading to various axiomatizations, probably not perceived as "clear" by an uninitiated audience.

: If the second part of the question concerns a lack of clarity in the article [[quantity]], it should be asked at [[Talk:Quantity]].  I see nothing wrong here with referring to a real number as a continuous quantity in the text, as this is clear enough in natural language without the need to supply precise technical details.

I think that a hint to an intuitive notion of a ''continuum'' is essential for reals, and I am along the lines of Trovatore in not being sure, if at this point a link is appropriate at all. A "broader founding" of vagueness for "quantity" might not be really optimal. I apologize for having caused these troubles by my inadvertency.

"Real numbers" has just been redirected to "Real number".  Fine with me, but presently "Rational number" redirects to "Rational number".

:Thanks for noticing that "rational number" has the same problem--it's fixed now.  The singular form is preferred for simple nouns like this to make linking easier.  For example, ''"...probability can be expressed as a [[:real number|real number]] in the interval [0,1]..."''  --[[User:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

:: In my opinion, the end page of redirections should be '''Real numbers'''. This causes no problems for linking to '''Real number''' as in LDC's example, as '''Real number''' would be diverted to '''Real numbers'''. The reason for this preference (and the same for '''Complex numbers''', etc.) is that the field of real numbers is constructed as a whole, and a single real number may only be defined by its relation to other numbers. This is different to articles like '''Group (mathematics)''', where the axioms that distinguish a group make no external references, and working within a single group is not uncommon.

:::WP standard is to use singular titles whenever it makes sense to do so. A single real number makes sense by itself (for example, in terms of the information it codes), so the article should be at [[real number]].

:::Using the singular form also makes it easier to link using either the singular and plural forms.

==Cauchy sequences==

''If we have a space where Cauchy sequences are meaningful (a metric space, i.e. a space where distance is defined), a standard procedure to force all Cauchy sequences to converge is adding new points to the space (a process called [[completing]]).

It should point out that this only works with a Euclidean metric or one equivalent to a Euclidean metric; using other metrics gives you the [[p-adic numbers]] instead.

To tie up this article with the entries on Model Theory, can someone tell me whether or not there is a first-order theory model for the real numbers?  A maths teacher friend of mine told me that there is, but this would imply, by Lowenhein-Skolem theorems that the reals are denumerable, or have a countable model, which which seem to be inconsistent with Cantor's diagonal proof of uncountability of the Reals. --B. Smith.

No, it would not imply that.  It would imply only that there is a countable field satisfying all of the same first-order sentences that the real numbers satisfy.  The Loewenheim-Skolem theorem does imply the existence of such a model.  If the model and the language are elaborate enough, one could write a first-order sentence saying the reals are not countable.  It would be true within the countable model.  That means that although there would be a sequence containing every member of the model, such a sequence could not itself belong to the model; there could be no enumeration '''within''' the model.

"The term 'real number' is a retronym coined in response to 'imaginary number'."
That hardly seems likely, since extension to the reals should always have seemed more urgent than extension to complex, and the reals need a name as soon as you consider them.  

IMO, real is intended to contrast with rational, and the motivation for "real" is that the rationals are an unrealistically limited set. That follows from the mind necessarily regarding all integer-legged right triangles as precise models of something from reality, if anything in math beyond counting is such a model; from irrational hypotenuses, it follows that rationals aren't quite the full set of numbers needed to correspond to reality, so the choice of the term "real number" reflects the hypothesis that there are no problems in the real world that the reals don't  suffice to express the answer to.  (In contrast, wanting imaginaries and quaternions takes some sophisticated mathematical abstraction.) 

In fact, the best evidence that "real" led to "imaginary" (not the other way around) is that "real" is a better fit to the reals than "imaginary" is to the imaginaries:  IIRC how one of my physics profs put it, it's not so much a matter of complex numbers having an imaginary part as that they have *two* parts, both real numbers representing something in the physical world, and it's just that there are systems like electromagnetic fields whose behavior looks simpler if you do the bookkeeping by labeling the electric field as the first component of a complex number and the magnetic as the second, and hiding the fact that the "multiplication" you do is, according to the rules of complex arithmetic, more complicated than the multiplication table you learned in grade school.  

So where's this "retronym" thing coming from; is it more than someone's conjecture? --[[User:Jerzy|Jerzy]] 06:41, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)

I don't think there was a monolithic nomenclature that all mathematicians subscribed to at the time when negative numbers, imaginary numbers, and real numbers were being investigated and systematized (15th century through 19 century-ish). History is messy like that. It is well known that negative numbers (first) and imaginary numbers (later) inspired censure (and sometimes even disgust) in the European mathematicians of the day, so the retronym thing is at least plausible, e.g. "The square root of -1? That's not a ''real'' number, it's some kind of imaginary thing!" I'd like to see a source too though. 
-- [[User:Cyan|Cyan]] 07:06, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Just for information, the first reference to ''imaginary'' numbers in the Oxford English Dictionary is to Descartes (in French) in 1637, and the first reference in English is in 1706: ''W. JONES Syn. Palmar. Matheseos 127 The Original Components or Roots of all Equations, may be either Affirmative, Negative, Mix'd, or Imaginary.''  In contrast, the first reference to a real number that they give is in a 1727 encyclopedia: ''CHAMBERS Cycl. s.v. Root, If the value of x be positive, i.e. if x be a positive quantity,..the root [of an equation] is called a real or true root''.  (These are actually citations for the use of ''real'' or ''imaginary'' as adjectives with the modern meaning, so they weren't looking specifically for the phrase ''real number'', which they don't cite until the 1910 Encyc. Brit.)  Although I'm not sure the OED is as good about backdating mathematical terms as they are in general, this gives some indication at least.  Anyway, since a rigorous definition and theory of real numbers wasn't really developed until the 19th century, it's hard to call it a ''retronym'' (what people had looked at in the past ''were'' real numbers but didn't ''define'' them; e.g. if you look at just the roots of polynomials, those are the ''algebraic'' numbers which are a countable subset of the reals).

The article begins with:

:''The real numbers are practically any numbers that can be expressed.''

I have to say I find this unsatisfying, especially since ''most'' (i.e. all but a countable subset of) real numbers arguably ''cannot'' be specifically expressed.  That is, if you take the meaning of ''expressed'' in a natural way: i.e. to be uniquely defined by a finite-length description (such as 4.73, √2, sin(1), ...).  And only a strict subset of these ''expressible'' numbers are computable (i.e. to an arbitrary precision in a finite time). [[User:Stevenj|Steven G. Johnson]] 01:34, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)

That depends on what "explicitly specify" means.  Consider, for example, [[Chaitin's constant]].  This is non-recursive, but in some sense can be specified.  [[User:Josh Cherry|Josh Cherry]] 23:31, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)

And what is this Russian school that assumes all numbers are recursive?  This sounds like a provably false statement to me, unless something nonobvious is meant by "recursive algorithm".  It's provably impossible to specify every real numbers uniquely with a recursive algorithm in the computer-science sense, i.e. a finite-size finite-state machine, or equivalently a finite-length program in any Turing-complete computer language.  (There are only a countable number of finite-length computer programs.)   (One can even explicitly define a real number, whose digits are e.g. based on the halting problem, that is uniquely specified by a finite-length description but which is not computable in finite time by any program.) [[User:Stevenj|Steven G. Johnson]] 20:00, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Certainly one can explicitly specify particular non-computable numbers. I haven't read everything above, so I'm not certain which '''"Russian school"''' is referred to, but it's probably something about constructivism, which is a philosophy that holds that an existence proof is not valid unless it "constructs" the object whose existence is to be proved.  For example, if you were to deduce a contradiction from the proposition that every even number greater than 2 is a sum of two primes, that would not be taken by constructivists to be a proof of the existence of a counterexample.

:However, ''most'' (all but a countable subset of) real numbers cannot be uniquely specified by a finite description of any sort (whether by a computer algorithm or otherwise).

== Negatives are that recent? ==

From the History section: "Negative numbers began to be generally accepted in the 1600s and were invented by Muslim mathematicians."

:Unless someone posts a *very* good source on that I remove it because it's ridiculous. Apart from the problem that the general level of European mathematics in the late 18th century makes it seem unrealistic that they didn't understand a concept so fundamental as negative numbers (Especially as Euler's work on complex numbers makes no sense without the concept of negative ones).
:Also look here: http://www.uni-essen.de/didmath/texte/jahnke/hnj_pdf/euler01.pdf -- Even if you don't speak German a simple look at the numbers should make clear that Euler used the - as an inherent property of the number instead of just as operator. (Not to mention that apparently west of India you could spend as much money as you wanted once you were broke because noone could grasp the concept of debt; I also wonder how Europeans could come up with imaginary numbers before negative numbers were used in Europe...)
:I assume whoever came up with that claim took valid concerns over solutions out of context (e.g. if I use Pythagoras to get the third side of a triangle, both positive and negative are solutions to that equation, but the negative doesn't make sense).

::: Come on guys - youre arguing the number of angels on a pinhead here -this is supposed to be an article for GENERAL consumption - not a finely hairsplit piece that is unreadable.  the objection "''"Almost all" is sometimes used synonymously with "all but [[finite]]ly many"; see [[almost]].''" is quite irrelevant, first because its one mans opinion, and secondly because it says SOMETIMES.  It may SOMETIMES be synonymous with all but finitely many, but presumably that means that also sometimes it is NOT synonymous with that statement.   "Sometimes may refer to;Sometimes - a pop song by Britney Spears Sometimes - an indie rock song by Ash Sometimes - a song by Hooverphonic"    Almost all means to me "very many, but excluding at least some"  Somehow I doubt that my definition is provably incorrect.  Almost means "not quite"; the question for you is whether "All" implies a finite quantity.  Is it possible to say "All numbers"  If not, then youre right.  If yes, then "almost all" in this context means an infinity, less a few.     Thats quite a nice philosophical question though; can an number be infinite if some members of the class are excluded?  Surely excluding a few would put finite limits on the set?  i.e. is the set "All numbers except those between 0 and 1" finitely limited (at 0 and at 1)?  Or is it infinite (because the upper and lower limits do not exist)?   But I suggest this is limited to the talk page, and not included in any way in the general page.

:::: This is a mathematics article; if you want an article on vague ideas people may have about real numbers you need to start a new one.

*A real number is the sum of an integer and a fractional part which has countably infinite digits (let's work in binary, so countably infinite bits).
*The integral part can be one of <math>\aleph_0</math> values, and the fractional part has countably infinite binary "choices" (i.e. there are <math>2^{\aleph_0}</math> fractional parts)
*Thus, the cardinality of the reals is <math>\aleph_0\cdot2^{\aleph_0}</math>, not <math>2^{\aleph_0}</math>

==Fundamental mistakes?==

I refer to the sentence: 'Real numbers may be rational or irrational; algebraic or transcendental; and positive, negative, or zero.'

Well, the term real numbers has actually been used like a generic term just excluding imaginary and complex numbers. However, this subordination is at odds with fundamentals behind set theory. The second diagonal argument by Paul du Bois-Reymond / Georg Cantor provided evidence for the set of real numbers to be uncountable while Cantor also showed that the set of rational numbers is countable.
In other words: According to CH, real and rational numbers are fundamentally different from each other. I doubt that there is a convincing explanation for this ancient discovery of 'alogos' so far. 
At least Ebbinghaus et al. wrote: '...it is possible to perform analysis without to know what makes the real numbers special (was reelle Zahlen wirklich sind)'.

Cantor claimed to use real numbers within his list. These numbers did not obviously differ from rational numbers except for two details. At first, the evidence demanded to change actually all infinitely many numerals. This is impossible to fulfill. Secondly, his evidence was given by contradiction, i.e. from the fictitious actual-infinite point of view. 

Anyway. The pertaining real numbers are just the opposite of the quality to be real in that, they have to be fictitious solutions of a task that cannot be performed by a finite number of steps. Having reached that clarity we should remove misleading obstacles of understanding:
 
i) The continuum of fictitious real numbers cannot directly include rational and natural numbers. For instance, die embedded number one has to have an actually infinite number of numerals (zeros) behind the dot in order to be exact.

ii) Irrational numbers like pi must no longer be considered a single element but rather like the unrealizable task to have all representing numerals, e.g. all decimals. The number pi is as fictitious as the quadrature of circle. 

iii) Be not mislead by stupid arguments like 'all numbers are fictitious'. One could likewise argue 'all numbers are imaginary'. Already Leibniz called infinitesimal numbers 'well-founded fictions'.  The definition of real numbers by Meray 1869/ Cantor 1871 referred to fictitious limits of                convergent sequences.

iv) Fictitious real numbers correspond to the amorphous genuine (non-Hausdorff) continuum where any finite amount of finite numbers is of no weight and correspondingly distinction between open and closed intervals is not justified. Also |sign(0)|=1.   

v) It is true, real numbers are not apt for immediate numerical calculation. However, this restriction is already known. Admission of it does not cause any disadvantage. On the contrary, it will hopefully pave the way for some overdue minor corrections to mathematics.

::The sentence misleadingly mingles two mutually excluding qualities: Rational numbers inclusive of natural and negative numbers are countable, while irrational numbers inclusive of transcendent and algebraic irrational numbers are uncountable. Since real numbers were shown to be uncountable they must not directly include rational numbers but merely embedded rational numbers. The latter differ from ordinary rational numbers in being just fictive numbers without complete numerical identity as are more obviously irrational numbers that correspond to unrealizable tasks like quadrature of circle. Embedded rational numbers also belong to a task that cannot be fulfilled: to represent an actually infinite amount of numerals. They are also outside the realm of finitism.  

Moreover, it does not make sense to include or exclude any single real number from the continuum, not even the number 0.000...(actually infinite amount of numerals) is special. --unsigned post by Eckard Blumschein, Magdeburg, Germany.

:::: (EB) Thank you. I will try and obey it. 

::: Now, who cares if the true rational numbers are merely embedded and not actually contained in the real numbers? 

:::: (EB) Let's clarify. A real number is p/q. An embedded real number is a*p/a*q with 'a' being 'actually' infinite. In other words, the embedded one is a 'real' number because it is just a fiction. Admittedly the wording is a bit silly due to lacking understanding of those who coined the words. If we ascribe properties to IR, then these properties depend on the fundamental peculiarity of all real numbers: All real numbers including the embedded rationals are just fictions. For that reason, they behave quite differently as compared with true rational numbers.   

::: Using your terminology, there is a one to one correspondence between "true" rational numbers and their "fictive" counterparts on the real line. 

:::: (EB) I do not think so. Bijection is based on exact numerical identity. There is no chance to pinpoint a bijection between pi and any numerically addressable position at the real line. We are sure that pi is located at the real line but we cannot exactly localize a corresponding point. Real numbers correspond to fictitious points. Not even the bijection between pi and pi is a bijection between real numbers because the symbol pi just defines a task. The pertaining real number is the fictitious solution to this unrealizable task.  

::: That correspondence preserves all the properties you could imagine of the rational numbers, 

:::: (EB) I agree with the mere word correspondence while objecting against the unproven and wrong guess 'one-to-one'. The very idea of actual infinity contradicts to the possibility of discrete numerical identity. Real numbers have a basic peculiarity. They are uncountable stuff constituting the continuum. In that they are fundamentally different from the discrete and countable rational numbers. Cantor was correct when he called infinity an abyss. As supposed with CH, there is no bridge between the two worlds discrete numbers and continuum. All effort aiming to use equivalence, isomorphism etc. is doomed to fail.    

::: and so, who cares if the real line contains "fictious" or "true" rational numbers? [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] ([[User talk:Oleg Alexandrov|talk]]) 14:50, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:::: (EB) Since even the tiniest interval of the real numbers is commonly imagined to contain an actually infinite amount of numbers, one has to ask for logical consequences. I conclude: Single real numbers, if they did exist at all, would absolutely not matter. The same ist still true for the hugest imaginable finite 'subset' of reals. Perhaps you will already comprehend that embedding of true rationals does not make any difference to the entity of reals. Nobody may care of them. They are lost. Consequently, the real line of continuum does not exhibit anything else than fictitious numbers while the other way round, the real line of discrete numbers merely contains discrete numbers.     

By the way, I agree with the statement: "The reals are uncountable". However, I do not share Cantor's interpretation claiming strictly more real numbers than natural numbers."
I argue: 'Countable' and 'finite' are qualities, not quantities. Being fictitious and being uncountable are just two aspects of the same peculiarity that makes the real numbers essentially different from the rational ones. We have to abandon the notion of isolated points in case of the continuum IR. So the basis for counting is missing there. Do not bother about that. It does not harm analysis.

(EB) It may illustrate: Any real number is an impossible alias fictitious number. 

: ''Of course'' the real line is fictitious! 
It is just an imaginary construct in the minds of mathematicians, a construct which has nice properties though. Actually, the geometric line is fictitious too, there no such thing in nature.

(EB) Do not blur the term fictitious! When Leibniz called his infinitesimals fictions, he clarified that they differ from ordinary numbers, while being not arbitrary but well-founded fictions.  
 
: A real number is a [[Cauchy sequence]] of rational numbers. 

(EB) I disagree. The decisive peculiarity is to consider the fictitious limit of this sequence. As long as you do not claim to completely include actually all of the infinitly many terms, the Cauchy sequence is still a rational number. Being impossible makes the difference.    

One can embed the rationals in the reals by the map q-> (q, q, q, ...). 

(EB) Really? This would demand numerically addressable points at IR.  

It seems that by real numbers you mean something else. 

(EB) I refer to what Cantor demonstrated to be uncountable. I also refer to the continuum.

Let us stick to the axiomatic approach please, 

(EB) Sorry, this would not fix the problem but perpetuate the errors. As found out by Brouwer: The law of excluded middle is basic for discrete mathematics, but it is not valid for the infinite. 

otherwise we are getting into metaphysics which is outside mathematics. 

(EB) Metamathematics rules mathematics. Selfconsistency of mathematics demands that uncountable numbers/sets must not be mingled with countable numbers/sets. Well, we need a fundamental correction to the abundance of axioms.

I regard this definition absolutely correct. It dates back to Meray (1869) and Cantor (1871). Other definitions (Dedekind cuts, nested intervals, equivalence classes) were claimed to be equivalent. I would like to object that there is just a single decisive criterion: In order to really define real numbers, not rational ones, the word infinite has to be taken seriously. This can be stressed by the attribute 'actual'. Of course, there is no actually infinite size. Infinity denotes a quality. One cannot make it larger or smaller. Cantor's quantitative notion of infinity was a big and tragic mistake. Nonetheless, Cantor's second diagonal proof assumes the real numbers in accordance to the definition with emphasis on actually infinite sequences. 

On the other hand, Dedekind's proud cut fails to actually provide any real number because Dedekind already started with the incorrect supposition of TND.

::: EB appears to be an advocate of what is actually quite an interesting philosophical viewpoint (although one that is uncommon among mathematicians): the rejection of the infinite. At one point he complains that "They are also outside the realm of finitism". [[Finitism]] (of which [[Kronecker]] was the most prominent advocate) does not believe in objects that take an infinite number of steps to construct from the natural numbers. However, [[Reuben Goodstein]] was able to derive results of [[real analysis]] within this viewpoint.  It is well-known that [[constructivism]] (of which finitism is a more extreme version) is just a good foundation for mathematics as the looser [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] which is more widely assumed (perhaps better - see [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC]]). Apparently the [[ultrafinitism]] of [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]] is an even more extreme version of this philosophy which denies the existence of the [[natural numbers]] as an object, as they take an infinite number of steps to construct. To me, this seems a more tenable philosophical position than finitism: why permit a countable number of steps to construct the natural numbers, but then reject using a countable number of steps to construct anything else? Unfortunately, ultrafinitism is reported to be inadequate to do much mathematics of interest.

:::The fact is, in virtually all mathematics we discuss facts about infinite sets about which we have less intuitive reason to believe make sense than perhaps we have about combinatorial, finite objects. When one accepts the result that there are an infinite number of statements that one can make about the natural numbers that may be taken as either true or false as axioms, one realises that the whole of mathematics is not quite as solid as it may have seemed before [[Gödel]]. However, the translation of all statements about the real numbers into statements about sets of pairs of natural numbers (i.e. rational numbers) through the [[Dedekind cut]] construction shows that there is no reason at all to feel less comfortable believing in the consistency of real analysis than that of number theory.

Recent edit war does highlight an important point. The question of whether 0.999… = 1.0 is one of those common questions which comes up when talking about the reals. Currently the article only contains the statement ''(for example, the representation of 1 is 0.999…).'' without any further treatment or links to appropriate places where its discussed. As one of the those recurent questions I feel it should get a better explination. Who first proved it, or is it axomatic? (I seem to recal there is some set where 0.999… != 1.0). --[[User:Pfafrich|Salix alba]] ([[User talk:Pfafrich|talk]]) 20:47, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:[[Proof that 0.999... equals 1]]. Read the talk page and the archives if you have some time. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 21:25, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:The article [[Proof that 0.999... equals 1]] seems well written and shows that the edit I reverted was merely a bad link :-). On a related point, it seems to me that [[Real numbers]] should say "Every real number has a unique representation as an infinite decimal ''not'' ending with an infinite sequence of 9s", like the article [[Decimal]]. This avoids the ugly exclusion of 0, and I think most people would be inclined to choose representations like 5.000... as canonical, rather than 4.999... [[User:Elroch|Elroch]] 22:49, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

I honestly can't see whats wrong with a simple link to the article in a see also section. Note this is not a theorem about base 10 numbers per say, it is a theorem about the representaion of the reals in any base. Seeing as real numbers are technically defined as an infinite sequance of digits in some base, this seems a perfectly reasonable statement. I'm sure cantor would have something to say on the subject. --[[User:Pfafrich|Salix alba]] ([[User talk:Pfafrich|talk]]) 14:20, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
:Actually, that's ''not'' the way the reals are usually defined in rigorous treatments. You could, if you wanted to, and everything would come out all right in the end, but you'd have a lot of technical annoyances along the way (try, for example, defining multiplication on reals thus defined, and then showing it's associative). The usual way to define them is via Cauchy sequences of rationals, though the older method of Dedekind cuts still has advantages in some contexts. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 19:00, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

This situation will occur in any number base, not just base 10. If B, a positve integer greater than 1, is used for our base, then .[B-1][B-1][B-1]... (.[B-1] repeating)is the same as 1. In base 2 we have .111... = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +...= 1. What is the difficulty with accepting .9 repeating is 1?

==definition==
Nowhere could I find a decent definition of what real numbers were in this. I might have missed it. At any rate, I added 

"Formally, the set of real numbers is the closure of the rational numbers"

err I should add that I realize it says "they can be constructed..." but I think it should start out by saying something like this since its the definition. --anon

:Its not just any closure, its the closure with regards to the eucliden metric. There are other closures of the rationals, called the [[p-adic number]]s. [[User:Linas|linas]] 15:29, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

------------

:As a scientist, but not a mathematician, I roughly know what a real number is - I think, because I havent been exposed to these distinctions for a while - and I needed a definition for some purpose, and came here.  I now remember why I hated how math was presented in school and college.  (I took it to 3rd year university).  Although this page is full of esoteric details about the things you can do WITH real numbers,  - which is fine if you know what a real number IS already - THERE IS NO INTRODUCTORY, GRASPABLE DEFINITION OF WHAT A REAL NUMBER ACTUALLY IS ON THE PAGE. 

WHY are mathematicians so obsessed with making maths texts impossible to understand unless you already know the field?  It seems to be a commonality.

The one statement that reassured me that my definition MIGHT be correct, was the statement that real numbers were retroactively defined in response to imaginary numbers!
I dont want to mess up the page, as I'm no mathematician, so I wont change this myself.  But can someone PLEASE introduce the following statement, with whatever changes are needed to make it accurate?  The historical section is fine, if you dont want it at the top.

"The term "real number" is a retronym coined in response to "imaginary number".  For thousands of years, all numbers used were real numbers.  However while the square root of 1 is 1, and a real number, the square root of -1 does not compute.  However this number  - whatever it is - is useful, and has been called &lt;i>.  All numbers which are multiples of &lt;i> are Imaginary numbers.<!-- watch out for bot edits reverting back to less-than symbols! -->  (link to page on imaginary numbers).   In recognition that there existed numbers which were not divisions of the regular number line from -OO to +OO, the regular numbers were renamed as REAL numbers, to be distinct from Imaginary numbers.  All numbers that are not imaginary, are real numbers."

I mean come on guys - this is what its all about, right?

given that the term real number distinguishes only from real and imaginary, its appaling that this distinction is not given clearly on this page.  Its like asking someone what non-existence is, and being told the many theories of life after death, properties of a vacuum, etc, instead of saying that its everything that doesnt exist.

== Intutitive defintion ==

As of May 9, we had this:

In [[mathematics]], the '''real numbers''' are intuitively defined as [[number]]s that are in [[one-to-one correspondence]] with the [[point|points]] on an infinite [[line (mathematics)|line]]&mdash;the [[number line]]. 

I don't like it, since it reeks of circularity. The only way we can related line to real number is by constructing the real numbers and relating that to lines. So far as synthetic geometry axioms go, the axioms could just as well have a model using other numbers, such as recursive numbers or hyperreal numbers. Moreover, saying it is a line misses the field structure! Discussion? Unless this gets some sort of defense I'm changing it. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 01:48, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

: Point taken, but the defence is that the introduction for a topic like this needs to be aimed at a ''very'' general audience. You can't use words like "construct", "axiom", "field", etc. It's okay if it's a bit circular, because most people aren't even aware that their intuitive concept of "number line" depends on a rigorous definition of "real number". The more rigorous stuff is later on in the article, where it should be. [[User:Dmharvey|Dmharvey]] 02:28, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:: It's the word "defined" that bothers me, I guess. Maybe another word would be good. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 04:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

::: "It's the word "defined" that bothers me, I guess. Maybe another word would be good."  How about "intuitively understood"

:::Again guys, speak to the person who needs this page, not the experts.  I like the point about the GENERAL AUDIENCE, but again, youre arguing fine points, instead of the main definition.  THere is a problem in talking about the number line, in that presumably the numbers from -oo i to +oo i are also part of a number line.  An imaginary number lne.  Field structures are meaningless to the reader, unless youre talking reproducing whitehead and russell or something.  REALS are NOT IMAGINARIES.  and THATS hat MAKES REALS, REAL.  Please keep the properties out of the definition, unless you can find a property which distinguishes clearly between Real and Imaginary.  The extra stuff can be added in later on; ONCE the definition has been correctly made.

:::: Sorry Shantrika, I have to disagree. Saying that "reals are those things which are not imaginaries" is grossly misleading. There are lots of things that real numbers aren't. For example, they're not [[p-adic number]]s. Your definition is a bit like saying "a laptop is any machine that runs on batteries" -- it assumes the reader thinks that all machines are computers. And I certainly don't think all our readers think that all "numbers" are complex numbers. [[User:Dmharvey|Dmharvey]] 11:13, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

== Gaps and stuff ==

I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&diff=52954810&oldid=52803952 reverted] the rewrite of the intro by Gene. In it the word "gaps" shows up three times, and I really think that continual [[mantra]] on how the rationals are riddled with holes barely wating to be filled is not the right tone to start this article with. 

: We can change the wording. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 19:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

It makes much more sense to start the article the way it is now, post-revert, with the numbers being a one-to-one correspondence with a line. That, if you wish, says the same thing, the reals are a continuum, the way a line is, but in a much more approachable and elegant way.

: It makes ''no'' sense to leave the article as it is, because as it is is wrong.  The point is to explain what real numbers are, and this fails to do that.
[[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 19:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

Some of the stuff I reverted is perhaps salvageable. We can get to it after the introduction business is settled. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] ([[User talk:Oleg Alexandrov|talk]]) 04:51, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

I think you should talk more and revert less. I don't agree with the gaps. Let us see what others say. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] ([[User talk:Oleg Alexandrov|talk]]) 20:47, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

: I quite like the intent of Gene's edits, maybe not with the wording though. I think it's a bit heavy on the "ordering" language. [[User:Dmharvey|Dmharvey]] 22:13, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:: How do you propose to discuss the fact that the real numbers are a continuum without circularity, unless you bring in order? The usual way to define or toconstuct an example of a [[continuum (mathematics)|continuum]] is by using the real numbers, for example in constructing the long line. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 22:54, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

I don't see what's "mathematically incorrect" about "Oleg's version" ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&diff=53061755&oldid=53048645 this diff]). And if it were incorrect, how could Gene make it correct by adding more stuff? Anyway it's not really true that there's "no room" to put more points into the real line; for example, you can embed it into "the" hyperreals (scare quotes on "the" because they're not unique). Gene, I think you need to calm down a little. Saying the reals can be "thought of" as being the elements on a line doesn't express anything terribly precise, perhaps, but it's not ''wrong'', and it's probably helpful to the naive reader. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 22:32, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:Oleg's version is mathematically incorrect because any totally ordered field, and certainly any totally ordered field embedded in the reals, has a "line". Hence, it isn't an intuitive definition, and I think that makes it unacceptable on the grounds that it's simply wrong. As for the hyperreals, you missed how I pointed out that you can add more to the rationals and still keep the field structure. With hyperreals, you have a "gap" between the finite hyperreals and the positive and infinite hyperreals, but you can't fill in the gap and complete the field. Hence, what I said was correct. And no, I don't think it is helpful to the reader to tell him or her that the reals are uniquely able to be thought of as a line, because that's '''false''', and false is bad. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 22:40, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
::Where did the word "uniquely" ever appear? The text said that the reals could be thought of as a line. That's true, not false; "uniquely" is your own interpolation, and no one's claiming it's a "definition", intuitive or otherwise. (Note that there's no requirement that a definition appear in the lead section; the lead section is for summarizing, not defining.)
::I don't agree that any totally ordered field embedded in the reals are a "line"; in particular, the rationals are not intuitively a "line". As for completing the hyperreals, you'd have to say what sense of "complete" you're interested in; I assume Cauchy complete, but what I found in the article talked about the Archimedean property, which your lead-section text said nothing about. You ''can'' find "room" to put more points between the reals. You lose the Archimedean property, and probably lots of other properties, but you can do it. So ''your'' text is "false". --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 05:47, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

Of course the rationals are a line. They not only get called an (affine) line, in contexts such as '''AQ'''<sup>1</sup>, but as totally ordered, they look just as much like a line as the reals do, because both look the same. Moreover, some people profess to be perfectly happy stopping at the computable reals and using them in place of the reals, and that implies presuming they are a line. If you used the computable reals to construct a model of Euclidean geometry, it seems to me the lines you get are perfectly honest lines. Could Euclid have told the difference? [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 07:14, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:No, I disagree. Intuitively they're not a line, but a "fog" or something. If you tell people the real numbers correspond to distances along a line, they'll know what you mean, without formalities (though they probably won't be able to formalize it themselves without help). It connects to a physical intuition, which is what's needed here, rather than all the stuff about gaps and ordered fields. Telling people there are no gaps doesn't add much; of course there aren't gaps in a line. If there were gaps, it wouldn't be a line. All that language does is increase the opportunities for confusion. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 07:30, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

::I have no idea what a "fog" is. Are the computable numbers a "fog"? As I pointed out, that's what some people are using by way of a line. Are hyperreal numbers a "fog"? They allow for models of Euclidean geometry also. As for "physical intuition", this seems like a Kantian position--we have a built-in notion of space, what Kant called a "form of intuition". That's not good enough for mathematics, because if it doesn't tell us what the properties of a line are well enough to contruct the reals, then the intuition is misleading us. As for "of course", in mathematics there is no "of course". There are no gaps if we insist there not be any, having first defined them, but geometers aren't all saying what you seem to claim they ought to. The affine rational line is a perfectly fine line for many purposes, and for some purposes where it won't work, other fields besides the real numbers often will work. Algebraic geometry over the algebraic closure of the rationals works pretty well, for instance. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 08:10, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
:::I think we ''do'' have a built-in notion of space, and when elaborated correctly, it results in the reals. It ''does'' tell us what the properties of the reals are, well enough to construct them; it just takes a bit of work.
:::That's what we should be trying to connect with in naive readers. Yes, of course the computable numbers are a fog; there are only countably many of them, so they have to be. There's nothing wrong with these other structures, but they aren't "lines". --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 15:01, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

I put this on the WikiProject Math talk page:

:Incidentlly, so far as calming down goes, Oleg reverted my page without first reading it, and then insulted me for not writing stuff he didn't bother reading. I think he is a little out of control here, and needs to calm down. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 22:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

Ok, since it seems people here are waiting on some outside opinions...Gene's first version with stuff on gaps was inappropriate for the intro.  It was too wordy in any case.  I like the "original" version better.  As for the current version, which adds the statement about "property that there is no room in the line to fill in more numbers", that seems ok to me.  --[[User:C S|C S]][[User talk:C S| (Talk)]] 03:34, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

:::"No room" was not my preferred language; I introduced it to appease Oleg, who seemed to have an allergic reaction to "gaps". However, the article on [[continuum (mathematics)]] says "gaps", and I'm now linking to that. "No room" was intended to convey the idea that there weren't any gaps in which you could stick more numbers, ie, that the reals form a continuum. Which is true, but if the language is worse than it originally was, go back.

:::The stuff on "gaps", explaining what a "gap" is, is now found in the "basic properties section, which people keep destroying with these reverts. 

:::Finally, I note that Lethe has gone ahead and reverted without discussing, even though there had been a gentleman's agreement not to do that. The reversion was based on blaming me for language I put in to appease Oleg, and which not everyone found objectionable, and demolished a lot of material without discussion. Is this not turning into reversion for the sake of reversion? It seems to me there is an attitude here of "I'm an administrator, so I get to decide". But that's '''not''' policy. People's adminstratorship does not add any lustre to their knowledge of mathematics or their writing skills. Please let's have a proposal before arrogantly reverting. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 07:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

::No, I noticed that right away, but I wouldn't say that intuitively the result is a "line".  Of course, it's all very vague wording, which is why I only said I was "ok" with it.   I would stick with the "original" wording in any case.  Despite Gene's concern over the possible misinterpretation of the intuitive stretch being made, in my experience (which admittedly is mostly university teaching experience) I've never found anybody to actually be confused over considering the reals as a number line.  --[[User:C S|C S]][[User talk:C S| (Talk)]] 06:24, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

:::I'm concerned that it seemed to have been presented as an intuitive definition, which I think is a bad plan. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 07:03, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

Comparing the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&oldid=52757303 version before the childish edit war] with the current version, I think that the former version does not make the difference between the rationals and the reals sufficiently clear. Gaps seem to be a good method to explain this; I think that is more accessible than the property that each bounded set has a least upper bound. So, at least some aspect of this explanation should remain, in my opinion. 

However, much of the section "Basic properties" currently duplicates stuff further on. My suggestion would be to keep the "ordered field" stuff out of that section. Another approach to explaining the difference between the rationals and the reals is to say that the reals are infinite decimal expansions. That seems intuitively pretty clear to me; what do people think about that?

Finally, I do not like the mentioning of gaps in the first sentence ("In mathematics, the real numbers may be thought of as numbers that correspond to the points on an infinite line — the number line — which has the property that there are no "gaps" in the line; the real number line forms a continuum."). This is rather confusing, I think, because the gaps are actually quite strange gaps. I fear that somebody who does not already know about these gap won't understand this sentence at all. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 09:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

: What do you think of saying ''in the first sentence'' that real numbers are numbers which can be expressed via infinite decimal expansions? I think you are right that infinite decimal expansions are likely to be thought of as intuitive, and after all, the real numbers can be rigorously constructed in that way. Then, having said that, use the magic word "continuum" and explain what that means intuitively as a lack of "gaps", which is further elucidated in the basic properties section?

== Real number ==

[[User:Oleg Alexandrov]] seems to me to be engaging in abusive reverts on this [[real number|page]], to a previous verison which is arguably incorrect mathematically and which removes a lot of new material, material for which he has given no argument for removal. He also says, falsely, that my attempt to satisfy his previous criticims amounted to "writing a one-liner" which seems to prove he hasn't even seriously looked at the version he is reverting from. I think we need other people to weigh in at this point. I am very much opposed to simply allowing it to say the real numbers have a number line and calling that a definition. My proposal to say they have a number line, with no "room" to fit additional numbers in, is an attempt to make the one-line introduction correspond to an actual rigorous definition, which will not be the case if we allow Oleg's revert.

:::I have reverted to the version with wider support (before reading Oleg's suggestion above, which I consider untenable for opinionated edits). However, there are things that need improving. In my opinion, the introduction does need expansion, especially as the idea of it being characterised by being a "line" is so vague and, as pointed out in discussions above, inaccurate to a purist, without using something close to a circular definition. I think the argument for giving some intuitive idea of connectedness or completeness in the introduction is a good one, and this is the part of the last edit I felt least inclined to revert. Surely some agreement on what more is needed, and how it should be worded is possible?

Gene, you have on more than one occasion deleted the following clear and precise sentence, and the following elaboration, and replaced it by a rambling and far less clear paragraph.

==Introduction==
The introduction of general articles is perhaps the most difficult part, as it needs to be accessible to someone with inadequate background to understand the rest of the article, but which should not be misleading. This seems a difficult task in this article: at present the introduction is intuitively clear, but does not make any attempt to identify what properties characterise the real numbers.

The introduction needs the inclusion of an intuitive mention of a property that distinguishes the real numbers among ordered fields. The two obvious alternatives are the least upper bound property and connectedness. How may one of these be described to give an accurate picture to a non-mathematician? (the word "gaps" alone would suggest a hole of finite size to most people)[[User:Elroch|Elroch]] 12:08, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:The intro as you seem to prefer it is in fact not intutively clear, because it suggests being on a line characterizes the real numbers, and it doesn't. I tried out a first sentence which said the real numbers were the numbers with a decimal expansion, which is accessible to the mathematically uniinitiated, but that got immediately deleted also. What was wrong with it? It's mathematically correct, does in fact characterize the real number numbers, and can be understood by the nonmathematician, so of course it's immediately deleted and replaced with something which suggests something incorrect. 

:How do you explain the reals are connected? You can't use path connectedness, which would be circular. You can't very well use general point-set topology. I don't see how to make connectedness work, which is too bad. LUB is equivalent to Dedekind complete and to the "no gaps" property, and it seems to me of the three "no gaps" is the most intutitive. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 17:38, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:::The description of the real numbers as infinite decimals is mathematically ugly, but the most widely accessible description. Hence if I saw this in the introduction I would cringe and leave it, as I did when I saw it later in the article.

:::The definition of connectedness comes from the natural order topology. It is worth pointing out here that your text about gaps was misleading because, as was pointed out, the rationals have no gaps in the mathematical sense, so this condition does not even distinguish the reals from the rationals. Hence your decision to repeat this edit was surprising. As I pointed out, connectedness is a stronger condition than having no gaps, distinguishes the reals among ordered fields, but is difficult to include in an intuitive introduction. Most people probably understand a line as being continuous in some sense (drawn without taking a pencil off the paper), despite the inevitable lack of formality in this, so that is a useful concept to include. [[User:Elroch|Elroch]] 09:27, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

::I don't think we need to get into that level of detail at first presentation of the concept. The thing to do is find language that connects with the physical intuition, the "built-in notion of space" as you call it. It really ''does'' exist, and it's the thing that's going to make the most sense to the naive reader. (Well, yes, some of them might connect with decimal expansions too, but that has the unfortunate side effects of suggesting radix dependence and of bringing up the point-nine-repeating thing; see [[Talk:Proof that 0.999... equals 1/Arguments]] for the worst-case scenario of that.) --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 17:46, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:: I agree with Trov. Also, everybody knows what a line is. Gene's verion had the real numbers being a "line without gaps", which would be confusing, as lines don't have gaps to start with. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] ([[User talk:Oleg Alexandrov|talk]]) 17:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Since people are saying the rational numbers aren't a line, I don't see how you can claim there is any kind of clarity on the definition of "line". I didn't get answers to my questions--are the computable numbers a line? After all, there aren't any computable gaps. You can't computably determine two sets of computable numbers which make a Dedekind cut for a non-computable number. You can't computably find a set of computable numbers with an upper bound which does not have a least upper bound. Where's your intution about "lines" on this one? What about surreal numbers? If you find a gap, you just stick in another number; that's how they are defined. You can't continue to do that when they form a proper class, but that doesn't make the "Field" of surreals much like the real numbers. Is this a line? The trouble is still one of circularity--if by "line" you mean homeomorphic to the real numbers, you are going around in a circle. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 18:02, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

::::I ''did'' answer you—no, the computable numbers are not a line, they're a fog of points. Of course it would be circular as a formal definition to say that a line is something homeomorphic to the reals, but a formal definition is not what I want here; I want to connect with the underlying shared intuition. People already ''have'' the intuition; we don't need to create it for them. All we need to do is point them to it, so they can say "oh right, that".
::::Then it takes quite a bit of work to see that the underlying Platonic object that they intuitively understand is homeomorphic to the reals, and not to one of these other structures. But that's the right answer in the end, which is all that needs to be conveyed at the first presentation of the concept. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 18:13, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::Personally, although appealling, I am not convinced it makes sense to talk about the underlying Platonic object as if it was a well-defined concept. Our belief in tbe real numbers comes from two things - the first is measurements in the real world, and the second is formal mathematics. I am not convinced that the set of sets of the rationals that are bounded above is an unambiguous concept (don't ZF and constructible set theory differ here?), although extrapolation of intuition from finite sets to infinite sets would suggest it is (I believe incorrectly). [[User:Elroch|Elroch]] 09:44, 16 May 2006 (UTC)
:::::Also, what on Earth is a "fog"? Incidentally, it is my understanding that the computable reals are computably connected, in the sense that any computable Dedekind cut defines a computable number, so we can't break them into two open sets computably. [[User:Elroch|Elroch]] 09:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

Asides from your discussion on "gaps" I'd like to point out that grade schools (at least here in the U.S.) teach real numbers as the set that is the union of rationals and irrationals and that is likely where many readers are going to look at this from. <br>
Also, why is the article organized as such: Basic Properties, Usage, History, Definition, Properties, Generalizations, etc.? I think may be we should work on restructuring the article and making it more clear before we add new stuff? (If we do add "gaps" we should merge it with Properties may be rather than sticking it at the top.) -- <i>'''<font color="blue">[[User:127|127]]</font>.<font color="orange">[[User_talk:127|*]]</font>.<font color="green">[[Special:Contributions/127|*]]</font>.<font color="red">[[Main_Page|1]]</font>'''</i> 00:44, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

: I'd like to chime in again here. I think it's clear from the discussion so far that we all have quite different ideas about (1) what is the best way to think about the real numbers, and (2) how many, and which of these ways, should appear in the introduction to this article.

: With this in mind, I think the introduction needs to have the following elements. It needs to have
:* Something along the lines of "the real numbers include both rational numbers and irrational numbers" (with ''examples''), along the lines of what 127.*.*.1 suggests. My rationale is that average Joe will, after reading this sentence, actually have a pretty good idea of what this article is about. If we only talk about "gaps", or Dedekind cuts, or Cauchy sequences, or even "points on a number line", I still think average Joe might still not know what the article is about at all. Mentioning numbers like 7 and -119/47 and Pi and the square root of 2 is the quickest way to bring him/her onto the intended wavelength.
:* For the same reason, it needs to mention infinite decimals; this has the advantage of providing both an "accessible" explanation of real numbers, and can be massaged with some work into a acceptable formal definition.
:* It needs to mention that historically, giving a definition of "real number" that is suitably rigorous for the purposes of pure mathematics was not an easy task, and was one of the most important developments of the 19th century.
:* It needs to give some hint of the various formal definitions that are available.
: In the end this makes for a long-ish introduction. I don't think that's a problem; it's a very important, central topic, and I think there really are a lot of things that need to be said upfront.
: So here's my attempt:
:: In [[mathematics]], the '''real numbers''' may be thought of in several different ways. From a "naive" point of view,
::* The real numbers include both [[rational number]]s (such as 42 and -23/129) and [[irrational number]]s (such as [[pi]] and the [[square root of two]]).
::* A real number can be given by an infinite [[decimal representation]]. For example 2.4871773339...., where the digits continue in some way, is a real number. <!-- ugghhh how better to phrase this? -->
::* The real numbers correspond to points on an infinitely long [[number line]].
:: However, these descriptions of the real numbers, while intuitively accessible, are not sufficiently rigorous for the purposes of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous definition of the real numbers &mdash; indeed, the realisation that a better definition was needed &mdash; was one of the most important developments of 19th century mathematics. Some of the more popular definitions may be summarised <!-- or summarized, for all you crazy americans :-) --> as follows (more detail given below):
::* It is possible, though cumbersome, to give a rigorous definition along the lines of "infinite decimal representation" as described above.
::* The real numbers may be obtained by starting with the set of [[rational number]]s and "filling in the gaps" using the notion of [[Cauchy sequence]]s. (The "gaps" here are the irrational numbers, but to avoid circularity of definition, one cannot define "irrational number" to be "a real number that is not rational", since the goal is to define "real number"!)
::* Again, starting with the rational numbers, certain kinds of sets of rational numbers ("Dedekind cuts") are declared to be real numbers.
::* The real numbers may be defined axiomatically as the unique ''complete ordered field''<!-- wikify these terms... -->. Although this approach does not provide a ''construction'' of the real numbers, it gives a list of properties that they must satisfy, which specifies them unambiguously.
: Finally, I just want to ask, does anyone have a reference for the claim that "real number" is a retronym as described in the current text? Even better, it would be very interesting to know where the term first appeared. [[User:Dmharvey|Dmharvey]] 12:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

::::This seems a good attempt to make the introduction accessible. One correction - the real numbers are the ''unique complete ordered field with the Archimedean property'' (or, rather neatly, the ''unique connected, ordered field''). Also, I am familiar with Keith Devlin's use of the word gap, meaning two points with no point between them. With this meaning, a total order is connected iff it is order complete and has no gaps. However, I think Devlin's meaning is a "local" one, so unless someone else knows otherwise, I don't have any objection to a different use of the word here. [[User:Elroch|Elroch]] 15:55, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

::::: Oleg, the bullet points don't bother me too much, but let me see what I can do. Elroch, thanks for the correction. How about this:

In [[mathematics]], the '''real numbers''' may be thought of in several different ways. From a "naive" point of view, the real numbers include both [[rational number]]s, such as 42 and &minus;23/129, and [[irrational number]]s, such as [[pi]] and the [[square root of two]]; or, a real number can be given by an infinite [[decimal representation]], such as 2.4871773339...., where the digits continue in some way; or, the real numbers may be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[number line]].

However, these descriptions of the real numbers, while intuitively accessible, are not sufficiently rigorous for the purposes of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous definition of the real numbers &mdash; indeed, the realisation that a better definition was needed &mdash; was one of the most important developments of 19th century mathematics. Some of the more popular definitions used today may be summarised as follows (more detail given below).

First, it is possible, though cumbersome, to give a rigorous definition along the lines of "infinite decimal representation" as described above. Another is to start with the set of [[rational number]]s, and to "fill in the gaps" using the notion of [[Cauchy sequence]]s. (The "gaps" here are the irrational numbers, but to avoid circularity of definition, one cannot define "irrational number" to be "a real number that is not rational", since the goal is to define "real number"!) Another possibility is to begin again with the rational numbers, and to declare real numbers to be certain kinds of sets of rational numbers ("Dedekind cuts") with arithmetic of these sets defined in an appropriate way. Finally, the real numbers may be defined axiomatically as the unique ''complete Archimedean ordered field''; although this last approach does not provide a ''construction'' of the real numbers, it gives a list of properties that they must satisfy, which specifies them unambiguously.

:: I lik the intro you suggest. I think it looks just fine without the gaps, that may be too messy for the intro.

::: Oleg, you were the one who started the revert war. The propsals are a nice improvement, except for one thing, they aren't actually in the article. The proposed first paragraph still has the problem that it looks as if it is intended to be a definition. Both "decimal expansion" and "rationals plus irrationals" can be used to define the real numbers, but the number line isn't a definition unless you explain what sort of thing a "line" has to be. It should be clear that corresponding to points on a number line is a ''property'' of real numbers, and not an informal definition, unless ''line'' is disambiguated. 

::: As for the gaps, it seems to me that giving them the axe and relying only on the LUB property misses something which could be helpful. I had an exposition of what a "gap" was which made perfectly good sense, but which was removed. A place for it makes sense to me. [[User:Gene Ward Smith|Gene Ward Smith]] 05:48, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: ''The propsals are a nice improvement, except for one thing, they aren't actually in the article.'' That's okay, we have all the time in the world! It will make it there eventually :-)

:::: Let me try to address your concerns. I agree that "decimal expansion" can be used in a rigorous (though slightly painful) definition, I have amended the text accordingly (see below). I'm not so sure about "rationals plus irrationals", because it seems a bit circular -- it sounds like you need a definition of "real number" before you can sensibly say what an "irrational number" is. I have tried using the word "informally" to make it sounds less like a definition to you.

:::: As for the gaps, I have really come around to the view that mentioning rational numbers, irrational numbers, decimal expansions, and the number line, are ''far'' more useful to a general audience than any discussion of gaps. I have absolutely no problem with a section elsewhere that expands on this idea, I think it's very important, and I invite you to write it and find a place for it. But I don't think it fits in the introduction.

:::: So here's another attempt.

In [[mathematics]], the '''real numbers''' may be described informally in several different ways. The real numbers include both [[rational number]]s, such as 42 and &minus;23/129, and [[irrational number]]s, such as [[pi]] and the [[square root of two]]; or, a real number can be given by an infinite [[decimal representation]], such as 2.4871773339...., where the digits continue in some way; or, the real numbers may be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[number line]].

These descriptions of the real numbers, while intuitively accessible, are not sufficiently rigorous for the purposes of pure mathematics.

Popular definitions in use today include [[equivalence class]]es of [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rational numbers; [[Dedekind cut]]s; a more sophisticated version of "decimal representation"; and an axiomatic definition of the real numbers as the unique [[complete space|complete]] [[Archimedean]] [[order theory|ordered]] [[field (mathematics)|field]]. These definitions are all described in detail below.

The term "real number" is a [[retronym]] coined in response to "[[imaginary number]]".

== Colloquial term ==

I removed the text from the top of the page:

:{{For|the [[economics]] term|real vs. nominal in economics}}

This is not an official term - a look at a general text on economics finds three terms starting with "real" including "real value", but not this one - but is more the sort of colloquialism a reporter might use when discussing a scheduled news item, referred to as a "number" quite often (for example, the regular employment statistics).

=="rationals and irrationals"==
The current lead says the set of all reals is "the set of all rational numbers and irrational numbers".  That makes it sound like a disjunctive kind, which it really isn't. Also, if you follow the [[irrational number]] link, it defines those as reals that aren't rational, so it's a bit circular.

The "axiomatic approach" part under the title "Definition" appears a bit strange to me. Why does it first introduce R as ''the set of real numbers'' and then state the axioms ''which are supposed to define real numbers'' like they were some random properties of R? There is no proper definition of reals under the title "Definition".

Arthur, I kind of think the change you reverted was probably correct. "Real" doesn't make sense as a contradistinction to "complex" -- if that were the case, they'd be called "simple numbers" or some such. I think the idea at the time was, real numbers were, in the natural-language sense, ''real'', whereas imaginary numbers were a figment of the imagination. I suppose this could be folk etymology; we should probably check it out in the historical documents. But it's such a natural explanation that I kind of expect it to be borne out by the facts. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 20:30, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

That definition lacks "for any n and m".

== etymology ==

The article currently claims:

:''The term "real number" is a retronym coined in response to "imaginary number".''

However, I checked the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', and it's not clear that this is quite true.

In particular, the OED has an entry for the mathematical usage of "real" as an adjective to describe "quantities (Opposed to IMAGINARY, or ''IMPOSSIBLE'')" (emphasis added).  In particular, the earliest usages they cite actually seem to be using the term "real" to describe only ''positive'' roots, and in another case it seems to be restricted to only ''rational'' roots:

:''1727-41 CHAMBERS Cycl. s.v. Root, If the value of x be positive, i.e. if x be a positive quantity,..the root [of an equation] is called a real or true root. 1841 Penny Cycl. XX. 150/2 Here a and b are meant to be real algebraical quantities, that is, reducible to positive or negative whole numbers or fractions.''

In short, the term "real" was originally a broader reflection of the prejudices of pre-modern mathematicians against certain classes of numbers as "impossible" or "unreal".  As time went on, eventually negative and irrational solutions were considered "real", and only the imaginary solutions were excluded...which apparently became fixed terminology by the end of the 19th century (when most of these prejudices had been cast aside in favor of a more axiomatic rigor).

:Interesting. Of course in some sense the Chambers quote is not directly on point, since he's using a distinct notion of ''real'' from the one treated in the article; in another sense, the example actually ''supports'' what is being claimed about ''real'' being coined in contradistinction to ''imaginary''; and in still another sense, you're right, it makes the current text problematic. I wonder if we could find a less dictionary-like source that gives more details about the history of the usage. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 00:52, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

::The point is that the term "real number" did not originate as an antonym to "imaginary number", it originated as a classification of polynomial roots, and gradually evolved from there to the modern definition.

:::Well, it isn't clear that the modern sense of ''real number'' actually evolved from the usage being cited, but if it did, it was apparently in contradistinction to an earlier sort notion of ''imaginariness''.

In both cases ''real'' means not imaginary (or not complex). I've no idea how reliable that is, but the quotation looks pretty convincing to me.

==Retronym?==
:''The term "real number" is a [[retronym]] coined in response to "[[imaginary number]]".

I doubt this, and it is unsourced.  The [[OED]] quotes Descartes: "Les..racines..ne sont pas tousiours reeles; mais quelquefois seulement imaginaires; " which suggests that the terms are twins. (This refers to real and imaginary ''roots'', of course; but the earliest uses will be in that context.) [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] <small>[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]</small> 22:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

The [[retronym]] question is something like a hoax, in my opinion. The term "real number", in various languages, appears well before 1872: Hamilton used it in English, Liouville in French, Leibniz and Gauss in Latin (realis quantitas). It comes straight from Descartes, the quotation from OED is correct: he divided the solutions of equations in "réelles" and "imaginaires", and the former into "vraies" (positive) and "fausses" (negative or zero). He also used "quantité réelle" and "quantité imaginaire". Later on, but already in the 18th century, mathematician started to say "number" instead of "quantity". But the contraposition between "real" and "imaginary" is there from the start.

Whilst a science article can't always subscribe to the axiom ''if you can't explain it to a layman, then you don't know your subject'', I'd go as far as to say that this article is obfuscatory in the extreme. I'm not a stupid person (my mother once told me), but I still fail to understand what the difference between a ''real'' and ''unreal'' (or is it ''imaginary'') number is from the first paragraph - and that is something I'm afraid I always complain about!

:The article is not (and should not be) primarily about the difference between real and imaginary numbers.  It is, and should be, primarily about the real numbers, which are a much subtler and more difficult concept than it would first appear.
:Still, I kind of agree that the article could do a better job of explaining, at least, ''why'' it's a subtle and difficult concept.  The geometric nature of the reals is underemphasized, and [[Zeno's paradoxes]], which are one of the key first indications that something non-obvious is needed, are not mentioned at all. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 16:08, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

In the "Uses" section, we have the following statement:

"Because there are only countably many algorithms, but an uncountable number of reals, "most" real numbers fail to be computable."

First of all, I kinda feel the truthines of this statement, but have never seen it proved. So, proof needed. Second, if this or these proofs exist, there should definitely be an inline citation, as this would be material enough for an entire article on its own (IMO).

==Nelson or not Nelson==
After two reverts to restore a previous controversial section on Nelson's theory of the reals, [[user:tkuvho|tkuvho]]([[User talk:tkuvho|talk]]) send me a private mail saying that I am wrong in my edits and that I have to read the IST page (There is no IST page, but I guess he meant [[internal set theory]]).

Here is my answer, which may be interesting to everybody:

"May be your are right in your assertion about Nelson. But
# The section was tagged twice as not sourced and non neutral. The tags precise that both are valid reasons for deletion. [[user:Protonk|Protonk]]([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) did it and you have reverted it without good reasons.
# My edit is aimed to resolve these issues in a constructive (usual, not mathematical meaning) way, which you never try to do. Again you revert it, starting seemingly an edit war.
# May be you are right and I am wrong about about Nelson theory. But you do not provide any verifiable source supporting your opinion. If you have such sources, you may edit the first paragraph of the new version by adding, for example "Edward Nelson (not Ed Nelson, which is a showbusinessman) has introduced another non ZF theory of the reals [cite source], which differs by this specific feature".
# In any case WP:NPOV implies that the space devoted to Nelson's theory should not be much larger than the space devoted to constructivism."

My comments:
# This sentence seems very dubious to me: "Abraham Robinson's theory of nonstandard nonstandard hyperreal numbers, although based on Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatization, is somewhat related to constructivism."  Any connection to constructivism there is extremely tenuous. The fact that constructivists are interested in real numbers is certainly true, but it should not need to be backed up by an example of Robinson.  I will add a proper reference to Bishop and Bridges. 
# I think that the paragraph on Robinson's hyperreals should be in the "generalizations and extensions" section. Would anyone object to that? 
# I don't know that Nelson's theory is very widely studied. Certainly it seems much, much less well known than Robinson's theory.  I think that, if it were going to be mentioned here, Nelson's theory should be limited to a single sentence and a link. Robinson's theory maybe deserves a paragraph.

:::Thanks, D.Lazard.  Carl: internal set theory is not as obscure as you seem to think.  Thus, in France it is actually ''more'' in vogue than Robinson's approach.  As far as the present page is concerned, Nelson's theory is more relevant than Robinson's, since the latter is a theory of an extension of the reals, whereas the former is a theory of the reals themselves--with respect to a different background set theory (though of course still with respect to classical logic, making it a far more "conservative" theory than Lawvere's, for example).

::::I don't think that Robinson's approach is particularly in vogue, but at least it's often described in model theory books as an application of ultraproducts. On the other hand, Nelson's set theory doesn't seem to be discussed either in set theory books or in model theory books, at least not the ones I have seen. 

::::There is a difficulty when you say "extension of the reals": the reals are a semantic object in the metatheory, like the natural numbers. So what happens (apparently? ) is that IST  never defines the actual real numbers, just as an &omega;-inconsistent set theory would never be able to define the actual natural numbers. I'm actually somewhat confused on that point, because the article on internal set theory is somewhat fuzzy, and claims that IST is a conservative extension of ZFC. ZFC certainly proves that there are no infinitesimal real numbers, so if the article is right then IST also proves there are no infinitesimals. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 17:41, 22 December 2010 (UTC)

:::::Actually I was hoping you would explain some of these things to me rather than vice versa.  Having said this, I was describing Robinson, not Nelson, as an "extension of the reals", so I don't understand your first comment.  Nelson's numbers are not an extension, they are the reals themselves.  When you speak of the "actual reals" you are apparently referring to what Nelson would call "standard" reals, i.e. reals with a truthful value of his "S" predicate.  These are indeed not a "set" in "internal set theory".  This corresponds to the fact that in Robinson, the reals do not form an ''internal set''.  With the "sets" that are allowed in Nelson, the least upper bound axiom is satisfied.  But this upper bound may fail to satisfy to "standard" predicate, so to a naive observer it looks "infinite".  Here the ZFC axioms will indeed prove that there are no "infinitesimals", but you will nonetheless have positive reals less than any standard real.  If I said anything that's amiss I would appreciate if someone could correct this, as I am much more familiar with Robinson than Nelson.

::::::I do not know enough of logic to have an advice on Nelson's theory. I may only said the following: When I was in mathematics department until the eighties (I am now in computer science department), I have heard of Cohen's and Robinson's results, but never of Nelson's. I guess, that, even in France, most young mathematicians (except those specialized in logic) have never heard of any of the three. In any case this convince me that the title of the section is the good one. CBM, my opinion is that Robinson is better here: Non standard analysis prove exactly the same results as classical analysis, but simplifies some (or many?) proofs.

:::::::I had a chance to look at this paper [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/papers/ist.pdf] by Nelson, enough to see what is going on (to some extent). What Nelson does is to add a new predicate, "standard", so that only some real numbers are called "standard". But this term "standard" does not mean "is a real number in the standard model of ZFC", it's just a new predicate that could have been called anything. 

:::::::What Tkuvho said about infinitesimals seems right to me. 

:::::::Now, Nelson's results imply that if there is a model of IST in which the "external" real numbers really are the real numbers of the standard model of ZFC, then the "standard" real numbers in this model are actually only a finite subset of the actual real numbers. In that case it cannot be said that the "standard" real numbers are meant to replace what we normally think of as real numbers. But it seems unlikely to me that IST has such a model, in which case the things that IST calls "external" real numbers will never be the set of actual real numbers (i.e. the ones in the standard model of ZFC.) In that case, which I think is quite likely but don't have the desire to check, IST does indeed entail an extension of the real numbers, because IST has no model in which the "real numbers" of the model are the actual real numbers. 

:::::::In any case, ignoring all that, I think that linking to the article on IST from this article is completely appropriate, since it's a relevant link, but it needs to be kept lower in the article, with the more technical topics, and the discussion should be kept very brief.

If you don't specify the background set theory then you have considerable latitude as to what your reals could look like.  They could for example look like Nelson's reals, assorted with the "standard" predicate, in such a way that some real numbers already behave as infinitesimals.  This is of course fabulous news for analysis; you can define a derivative by actually forming the infinitesimal quotient a la ancienne; you can write down a Dirac delta function that's actually a function rather than a distribution.

If you start with the IST axiomatisation, you get a real field with greater ability to express intuitively appealing constructions in calculus.  Carl: I think I can appreciate that your "idealized geometric line" is a ZF-based real field.  On the other hand, quantum theory tells us that certain tiny lengths are inaccessible even theoretically.  Similarly, the finite size of the universe tells us that certain huge sizes are inaccessible even theoretically (see the related motivational discussion at [[IST]]).

The following entry seems highly questionable:

: 'Note importantly, however, that all actual measurements of physical quantities yield rational numbers because the precision of such measurements can only be finite.'

::: Note importantly, however, that all actual measurements of physical quantities yield approximate values which are usually expressed by finite [[decimal]] or [[Binary numeral system|binary]] numbers, which are rational numbers (here finite means that there are only a finite number of digits in the fractional part of the number). In particular, real numbers are approximately represented in computers by [[floating point]] numbers, which are also rational numbers. Nevertheless these rational values are not manipulated as rational numbers, but as approximations of unknown real numbers. For example the product of two floating point numbers is different of their product as rational numbers, as the fractional part is truncated to keep a fixed precision.

::Notice that Lapasotka said "by <u>counting</u> how many times you can fit a 1 m^2 square plate diagonally on the way" (emphasis added).

: My counter argument is probably too naive, but there is certainly a problem here. In mainstream physics the space and time themselves are modeled using the real numbers, and one can certainly conduct measurements which necessarily produce irrational values for some quantities in the same physical model. If you model an actual cylinder by a mathematical cylinder, the diameter and the circumference of the cylinder will have the ratio &pi; in your physical model, and measuring either of these quantities from the actual cylinder will yield an irrational value for at least one of them in the physical model.

: Of course one stores only an appropriate number of digits for different quantities when conducting physical measurements in practice, so taking the opposite point of view one could say that actual measurements only yield integer quantities. But this is only a convention. I really cannot see why I couldn't take an ordinary measuring tape and wrap it around an actual cylinder to see that its circumference is about &pi; m. This is a legitimate physical measurement which yields an irrational number.

: BTW, has anyone else heard about a court ruling where the ratio of the diameter and the circumference of a circle was fixed as 3.14? [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 21:31, 5 January 2011 (UTC)


As I see it, the valid point being made by the existing text is the following:  ''Real numbers are infinite-precision objects.  It is impossible to make a measurement to infinite precision, nor can computers store infinite-precision representations.''

That is true and worth saying.  What's fishy is the idea that, given that the objects represented are not infinite-precision real numbers, they must be ''rational'' numbers.  I don't think they are.  To me they seem more like "fuzzy real numbers", real numbers represented within a tolerance.

Unfortunately, going into too much detail along ''those'' lines is likely to run afoul of [[WP:OR]].  So I think it would be better to say that you can't make measurements to infinite precision nor represent them in computers, and leave it at that. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 22:06, 5 January 2011 (UTC)

::The redaction I have proposed above for replacing the questionable sentence seems to me to be more or less the same as Trovatore's "fuzzy real numbers". The fact that the product of two floating point numbers is different from their product as rational numbers appears as a key to show that measured values, although represented by rationals, are '''not''' rational numbers (we find here a key distinction, which is common in computer science, between a (mathematical) object and its representation.

:: ''Computers cannot directly operate on real numbers, but only on a finite subset of rational numbers, limited by the number of bits used to store them. However, computer algebra systems are able to treat some irrational numbers exactly by storing their algebraic description (such as "sqrt(2)") rather than their rational or their decimal approximation.''

: Another perplexing passage in this section is

:: ''Unlimited precision real numbers in the physical universe are prohibited by the holographic principle and the Bekenstein bound.''

: The citation leads to ArXiv (not peer reviewed) into an article where this problematics is not even mentioned (at least in a short glance.) Besides, what is an "unlimited precision real number"?

== Structure of the article ==

How about dividing the material in the article as follows:

* Introduction (not a section)
* 1.Elementary description
* 2.Historical development
* 3.Formal definition
* 4.Uses in mathematics and sciences
* 5.Extensions and generalizations

I could write an elementary geometric decription with pictures into the first section. That is also a good place to explain the decimal expansions and perhaps uncountability of real numbers, which can be done in relatively simple terms.

:"Incremental change" is the key, as I already mentioned above.  I don't see much support among the key editors at this page (many of whom are professional mathematicians) to sweeping changes to the page.  Some of your ideas are good, but their implementation requires patience.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 19:15, 15 January 2011 (UTC)

I assume that reordering or merging stubbish sections is an incremental change if their content is not changed. The real proposition here is to divide the definitions/descriptions (1 and 3 in this list) into two parts. The "Elementary description" should be accessible to a wide audience and a good reading for precalculus students in US system. It should also follow the historical development of real numbers, explaining the topics in the order

: Geometric considerations -> Algebra -> Decimal representations -> Completeness (no gaps in the real line)

The "Formal definitions", I think, is an appropriate place to go [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], and to include the current Properties section in it. Also the wordings could be a little bit more precise. For example, real numbers "is not a complete metric space", but rather it "has the standard metric ''d(x,y)=|x-y|'', which is complete." [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 20:53, 15 January 2011 (UTC)

:I am not a big supporter of Bourbaki, either.  On the other hand, this page happens to be ''about'' the unique Archimedean complete ordered field, not about measuring temperature in the refrigerator.  What's the last time you used an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences to measure temperature?  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 21:07, 15 January 2011 (UTC)

== On introduction ==

I think the introduction should start with a conscise non-jargon description of the concept of real numbers. For instance "continuum" is jargon and does not describe much to anyone who does not understand the concept of real numbers already. Also the dichotomy of reals into rationals and irrationals should be postponed a little bit, because it doesn't describe anything either (unless you already understand what real number AND rational numbers are).

'''Proposal for introduction:'''

[[Image:Latex real numbers.svg|thumb|100px|Symbol often used to denote the set of real numbers]]
Real numbers are [[mathematics|mathematical]] objects that are used to [[measurement|measure]] various [[quantity|quantities]] in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and other [[sciences]]. Real numbers include [[natural numbers]], which are used in counting objects (two apples, four cars, three Cadillacs etc.) as well as ordering them (first, second and third place in a contest etc.), but real numbers are also useful in measuring quantities which can "change continuously", such as the temperature inside a refrigerator or the length of a fuse.

The question "What real numbers really are?" is largely [[philosophy|philosophical]]. Instead, in mathematics the real numbers are defined rigorously by how they behave. The real number system consists of the [[set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\mathbb R</math> of all real numbers, the [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], and the [[order (mathematics)|order relation]] between two real numbers. The [[axioms]] of real numbers describe precisely how this system of real numbers behaves, and they are tailored to encapsulate the [[geometry|geometric]] idea of an [[infinity|infinitely]] long [[line (geometry)|line]] with two special points 0 (the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]) and 1 on it (this particular line is frequently referred to as the [[number line]] or the [[real line]]). Real numbers correspond to the points on the number line and the order relation ''x''<''y'' means that the points ''x'' and ''y'' appear on the number line in the same order as 0 and 1. Addition of real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' corresponds to [[parallel translation]] of the corresponding line segments starting from 0, and their product is determined by the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] of these line segments and the line segment from 0 to 1.

[[File:Number-line.svg|right|thumb|300px|Real numbers as points on an infinitely long [[number line]], and [[integers]] as its subset.]]
The set <math>\mathbb N</math> of natural numbers contains those real numbers 1, 2=1+1, 3=1+1+1, ... that can be reached by adding the number 1 arbitrarily many times to itself, the set <math>\mathbb Z</math> of [[integers]] contains 0, all natural numbers and their negatives, and the set <math>\mathbb Q</math> of [[rational numbers]] contains all real numbers <math>\tfrac{m}{n}</math>, where ''m'' is an integer and ''n'' is a natural number. Rational numbers are [[dense set|dense]] in the set of real numbers in the sense that for any real number there is a rational number arbitrarily close to it. However, there are points on the real line that do not correspond to rational numbers, a fact of which the ancient Greek and Indian mathematicians were already aware of. The most common example is the diagonal of the unit square, which is of [[irrational number|irrational]] length <math>\sqrt{2}</math>.

The [[complete metric space|completeness property]] of the real number system encapsulates the idea that there are no holes (or gaps) on the real line, and also that there are no infinitely small or infinitely large real numbers. Informally it states that if one cuts the real line into two halves, then exactly one of the halves will contain an end point. The set of rational numbers does not satisfy this property, since one can cut it into two halves at <math>\sqrt 2</math>. There are extensions of the real number system where both infinitely small and infinitely large real numbers exist, and they are studied in [[non-standard analysis]].

A common way to represent real numbers is by [[decimal representation|decimal expansions]] such as 523, -4.25, and 4.91648367... where "..." signifies that the decimal expansion continues indefinitely. Integers correspond to decimal expressions without a fractional part (the sequence of [[numerals]] after the decimal point) and rational numbers to those decimal expressions for which the tail of the rational part is periodic, such as <math>\tfrac{25}{12}</math>=2.08333... Irrational numbers always have infinitely long decimal representations without any periodicity, for example, [[pi|π]]=3.1415926535...

Please comment. I will wait for few days before tampering with anything. Maybe some pictures will be helpful in visualizing the meaning of multiplication and division of real numbers. [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 15:35, 9 January 2011 (UTC)

::The "holes" or more precisely, "gaps", and the completeness property are relevant to this page.  Note however that the rest of the material above applies just as well to the rational numbers.  I know it may be shocking to realize one does not need the "real" numbers to measure temperature inside the refrigerator, but I don't think we should necessarily impose such an illusion on our readers.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 16:10, 9 January 2011 (UTC)

I added "gaps" by your suggestion, and also something about irrational numbers. The geometric constructions for the multiplication and addition are of course the same for rational numbers, but the crux is that ''they work equally well for all real numbers'', and that they can be explained to people without knowledge of higher mathematics or axiomatic systems.

Of course one can measure the temperature of a refrigerator with quite a few different number systems, of even with some suitable refrigeratory Performance Index taking values from blue to red, for that matter, but this article is about real numbers, which is the standard system for measuring physical quantities "taking values in the continuum". I was being careful not to state that one '''needs''' real numbers to do physical measurements, but only that they are useful in things like that. [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 22:47, 9 January 2011 (UTC)

:Not really.  People interested in doing physical measurements on the one hand, and people interested in gappiness and completeness on the other, form two largely disjoint groups of individuals.   The concern for completeness is a largely theoretical concern having little to do with computation.  You can do all of Euclid and not notice there are any gaps, as Dedekind pointed out.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 01:20, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

You cannot do all Euclid and not notice that there are gaps on the rational line (which I suppose you meant). Algebraic numbers will do, however. But back to the point:

We need more opinions on the relevance of the discussion of what real numbers are really needed in physical measurements within the article. I see it as an unneccessary complification, since one can also turn the question upside down and ask ''what numbers need to be discarded''. I think we agree that there should be a section on the subsets of real numbers that can be constructed by certain finite processes, such as floating point numbers, algebraic numbers and geometrically constructible numbers, as well as some others subsets such as definable real numbers. However, my impression is that mainstream physicists (or other scientists) do not care too much about these finesses and perhaphs they should not be mentioned in the introduction even though they are of mathematical and (perhaps) philosophical importance.

If there are no objections, corrections or improvements I will paste the text above into the introduction within a few days. [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 07:12, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:I object, the the grounds that the expressions "real measurement" and "real number" do not refer to the same meaning of the word "real".  Namely, real numbers are a number system that has been developed with certain theoretical considerations in mind, such as the property of completeness making it a useful system in mathematical arguments.  Measurements in the real world, on the other hand, and as Lapasotka acknowledges, "do not care too much about these finesses".  Arguing that real numbers are needed to measure the temperature in the refrigerator is therefore merely a play on words.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 10:36, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

To Tkuvho: Please re-read 'but real numbers are also useful in measuring quantities which can "change continuously", such as the temperature inside a refrigerator or the length of a fuse.' I agree on the questionability of the statement 'real numbers are needed to measure the temperature in the refrigerator', but this is a different claim. What do you think of the first (actual) one? [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 13:27, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:The subsection [[Real_number#Uses]] already contains an appropriately brief discussion of measurement and other physical applications.  If you mean to ask literally whether real numbers, including the completeness property, are useful in measuring temperature inside the refrigerator, I would have to express scepticism.  Are you confusing the two meanings of the word "real"?  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 14:07, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:A clarification: [[decimal number]]s are useful in measurement; a similar claim for [[real number]]s is questionable.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 14:09, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

Alright. Maybe one needs to be more precise: 'but real numbers are also useful in '''modeling''' quantities which can "change continuously", such as the temperature inside a refrigerator or the length of a fuse.' Either in [[Real_number#Uses]] subsection or in another subsection covering decimal representations and floating point numbers one could underline your point. BTW, I don't think I have confused the meaning of the word "real" as the part of the combined word "real number" into its other possible meanings. Whether ''any'' numbers are "[[Reality|real]]" in the everyday sense of the word is a philosophical question that I will not try to answer. [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 14:37, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

:I just don't think that the completeness property is useful in anything having to do with refrigerators.  Decimal numbers and floating point numbers are useful in dealing with refrigerators.  I still think you have the wrong address.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 15:11, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
::My objections are somewhat different.  Completeness is not used ''directly'' in real-world applications, but the reals are the most mathematically natural structure that works, and that naturalness aids you in all sorts of ways.
::Basically I think the proposed text is too long, insufficiently geometrically-oriented, and it says a few things I don't agree with.  It's too much like an essay &mdash; not a ''lot'' too much, but a little too much.

:::I have a deja vu feeling that we had this discussion somewhere before :)  Prithee tell me whereby are the real numbers so natural?  They are the unique complete ordered field alright, but by the time you are done explaining completeness as well as uncountability (go tell '''that''' to a laboratory assistant) how much more natural have you gotten than saying "roots of all polynomials"?  Decimals, not real numbers, are used in measurement.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 17:54, 10 January 2011 (UTC)

To Trovatore:  Thank you for the comment. I feel myself that the geometric explanation of the real number system is too lengthy, so it is probably better to cut it down to a few words and move the rest together with some pictures into a short subsection. I somehow feel the same about '''N''','''Z''','''Q'''-part, but from the previous comments it seems that constrasting real numbers with rational numbers cannot be left out of the introduction. Most importantly, saying only that "real numbers can be defined axiomatically" is not a satisfactory solution. Can you please point out the things you do not agree with. Also some ideas how to switch the bias would be useful, but let us keep in mind that this article is about '''real numbers''' (as defined in mathematics), not about "real world" or practices of storing measured data in science laboratories.

:::To Trovatore: Adding a more detailed discussion of geometry is a good idea.  I am not sure whether it should go in the lede or in one of the sections, but one could mention what is known in the literature as "Cantor's axiom", namely the positing of the identification of the numerical continuum on the one hand, and the geometric line in space, on the other.

::::I think that's a little bit backwards.  My position is that the geometrical line is the ''motivation'' for the reals in the first place.  To be sure, there are other applications; they're also the natural way of modeling other physical quantities that appear to vary continuously, such as energy.  But geometry, I'm pretty sure, came first, and is still the most natural way of understanding the structure.  --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 07:56, 11 January 2011 (UTC)
::::This is one place I agree with Trovatore. The identification of points on the line with numbers has to date back at least as far as Descartes. But the ancient Greeks were able to work with lines, and obtain non-obvious results about real numbers such as the irrationality of the square root of two, starting with the real line and adding a coordinate system rather than starting with a field and adding topology.

I did a little streamlining on my original proposal, deleted the mentions on proportionality and re-explained multiplication by comparison of areas. I really think there should be a section where the relationship between real numbers and plane geometry is explained more throughoutly in elementary (pun intented) terms. The fact that real numbers represent abstract proportions should be presented as well, but I don't have a very good idea how.

:I'll comment more later.  But one thing is it's too long.  A ''lot'' too long, maybe 2x.  Another is the bit about mathematicians talking about how reals behave rather than what they are &mdash; that's OK if it means structuralism, not OK if it means formalism.  Those are the two big things.  I'll come back and analyze more closely. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 09:35, 14 January 2011 (UTC)

Structuralism vs. constructivism is a good point, and writing down a short description taking into account both points is a challenging task. 
My understanding is that nowadays most mathematicians tend to be somewhere between platonists and structuralists, and constructivists are in the minority, so I didn't consider this as a major fault. I compared the length of the introduction to those of the featured math articles and it seemed to be about 50% longer on average. I added a comment on structuralism and shortened the proposition a little bit. Actually it is not much longer than the introductions of some featured math articles any more. To shorten it further I think the discussion of '''N''','''Z''' and '''Q''' could be almost entirely discarded. [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 10:27, 14 January 2011 (UTC)

To Trovatore: I think I misunderstood your earlier comment. Indeed, geometric intuition should be emphasized either in the intro (which is hard if we want to keep it short) or in the first section about basic properties.

== Constructive attitude needed! ==

The page is a pain to elaborate. Almost everything is reverted instead of modified and no-one seems to be able to get anything done with it. It is a shame, since [[real numbers]] is one of the most important topics in mathematics, and the page as it is right now is a mess. Before I started on it I took a look on featured articles in mathematics and noticed that an '''elementary description''', accessible at least to high school students, is an essential part of them. Here are some comments:
* ''Only stating the definitions and properties using math jargon leads to an article which is readable only to people who are familiar with the content already.'' (Therefore, to a useless article.)
* The geometric intuition of an infinitely long number line with addition corresponding to concatenation and multiplication corresponding to the proportionality with respect to the unit [0,1] ''is the intented model for all axiomatic definitions of real numbers''.
* Claiming that the real line is '''only''' a geometric interpretation of the real numbers is backwards, extremely POV and historically inaccurate.
* Collaborative effort should mean ''modifying'' inaccurate passages, not reverting them altogether.
And a kind request:
* Take a look at the featured articles in mathematics and see how they are written.
* Elaborate this article. It needs it. Don't destroy everything that is added to it.

== Recent change may have unintended meaning. ==

A recent change by a user made subtle modifications to a sentence that drastically altered the meaning of the statement. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Real_number&curid=20646438&diff=414469201&oldid=414101422#cite_note-4 Here] is the link to the change in question. No sources were added. Is the new meaning or the old one correct? [[User:Cliff|Cliff]] ([[User talk:Cliff|talk]]) 18:12, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

: I guess that the new formulation is correct. It is sure that [[Richard Dedekind]] has given a rigorous definition of the reals, well known as [[Dedekind cut]]s. What has to be checked is the date of this work. In fact the article [[Dedekind cut]] refers without date to the essay where Dedekind gave this proof and links to the English translation dated of 1901. On Scholar Google I have found a citation giving the date of 1872 to the English title of this essay. Moreover, in the preface of this essay, Dedekind says that he has communicated this construction to some colleagues a long time before publishing the essay. 

: In summary the edit seems correct, but the date should be checked and source is needed. Moreover "were given by Richard Dedekind (1856) and then by [[Georg Cantor]] ..." would better be replaced by "were given independently by Richard Dedekind (1856) and by [[Georg Cantor]] ..."

My mistake, I was not clear enough. I don't challenge the information about Dedekind, that's easy enough to verify. My question about the modifications were actually to the second paragraph in the History section. The change implies that the the acceptance of these types of numbers was local to Europe, but that Chinese and Arab scholars had accepted these ideas earlier. The previous incarnation of the paragraph indicated that these three regions accepted these notions at about the same time. [[User:Cliff|Cliff]] ([[User talk:Cliff|talk]]) 20:20, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

The changes have now been reverted, but which is correct? since there is no source for either contribution, how do we know which is correct?

==Incremental change==
I am not sure if this is encoded in some formal wiki regulations somewhere, but it seems to me that the appropriate way to proceed with a lede is '''incremental''': one generally avoids making sweeping changes, and adds items one at a time.  This is surely the best way of avoiding reverts.  [[User:Tkuvho|Tkuvho]] ([[User talk:Tkuvho|talk]]) 09:33, 14 January 2011 (UTC)

:I have read again both introductions. It appears to me that the proposed new one is better but too technical: the fundamental operations need to be enumerated, but their description should be left to the body of the article. Also, in the line of  Tkuvho's suggestion, it should be carefully checked that no idea of the old introduction is omitted.
:Another thing: the proposed introduction refers to the geometric idea of "the real line". Therefore it should be linked to the article [[line]], where, among other definitions, lines are defined as subsets of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.Thus care is needed to avoid circular definitions, even if they are informal. Note that the introduction of [[line]] has been recently changed, because it suffered of the same issues (but worse) as the one of this article.

I copied the proposition on the talk page for the reason that it can be incrementally changed before replacing the original one. I felt that the original introduction needed so many structural changes that it was better to do them at once to avoid unreadable versions of the page. Here is a list of (seemingly) unmentioned things in the original intro:
# Complex numbers (better only to mention only inside the article)
# "—indeed, the realization that a better definition was needed—was one of the most important developments of 19th century mathematics." (This remark fits better into the History section)
# equivalence classes, Cauchy sequences, complete Archimedean ordered field (too technical for an introduction of such a central topic, which should be readable for a wide audience.)
# Dedekind cuts (This is actually described, but "Dedekind cut" is not mentioned)

== Questionable matters in Uses ==

Why is the following metaphysical "deduction" still there?

:"Note importantly, however, that all actual measurements of physical quantities yield rational numbers because the precision of such measurements can only be finite."

And what about the other even more questionable statement, which is certainly not widely agreed upon and only backed up by a non-peer-reviewed citation?

:"Unlimited precision real numbers in the physical universe are prohibited by the holographic principle and the Bekenstein bound.[3]"

I skimmed through the citation and even if it was reliable and peer-reviewed (which ArXiv is not), it did not imply such a strong and controversial conclusion. Besides, the existence of any sort of numbers in the physical universe is a philosophical question, and should be left out of mathematics articles. At most, there could be a section called "Real numbers and metaphysics" where one can include statements like these. In the way how they are stated now they might give a false impression on the importance and definiteness of real number system at the heart of modern day mathematics and its applications.

:"Actual measurements" actually yield finite decimals, not rational numbers, this should be corrected.  As far as unlimited precision, quantum mechanics certainly tells us that infinite divisibility breaks down at sufficiently small scales, so the numbers introduced by [[Simon Stevin]] do not model reality accurately at that scale, and we don't need to go to an arxiv post for that.

I elaborated the "physical sciences" part into a form which most working mathematicians and physicists can probably agree with. I am still waiting for more comments on the "infinite divisibility". As far as I understand, the space-time is actually modeled by a Minkowski-space (effectively '''R'''<sup>4</sup>) in relativistic quantum mechanics, or by some higher dimesional fibre bundle in super string theories. I don't see how in such framework "infinite precision real numbers" do not exist in the "physical universe". After all, statements as above can only be made with respect to some ''physical model'' of the reality. [[User:Lapasotka|Lapasotka]] ([[User talk:Lapasotka|talk]]) 13:23, 27 May 2011 (UTC)

I edited the part on the existence of infinite precision real numbers in the physical universe in accordance to the Wikipedia links. I am not an expert on these matters, but I tried to be true to the referred articles. Somekind of elaboration was needed, because the previous statement was simply too radical to be stated only "as matter of fact". Next I would like to draw attention to the P=NP -part.

==Decimal digits==





''A real number is one that can be expressed in the form 'DDD.ddd'. 
DDD is zero or more decimal digits 
ddd is zero or more decimal digits 
Of course, DDD must be finite in length. This restriction does not apply to ddd.''

Why must DDD be finite in length?  If a sequence of real numbers goes to infinity, then there must be an (countably) infinite number of digits in ...DDD.
What am I missing?

:I don't really understand the question.  The sequence 10<sup>1</sup>,10<sup>2</sup>,10<sup>3</sup>,10<sup>4</sup>,... goes to infinity, but none of the numbers have infinite digits.

:In effect, a sequence of numbers may go to infinity, but a single number can't.  (Consider the problem of comparing two such "infinite integers".  How could you decide which was bigger without calculating all the (infinite) digits ..DDDD for both numbers.

:On ...DDD.ddd...: ...DDD.ddd, for a finite .ddd defines the 10-adic numbers. p-adic numbers form a field only when p is prime. The real numbers are an ordered field. How do you order the repeating numbers a=...101010. and b=...010101. so that field order is preserved, giver B=10A+1 and A=10B?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.236.65.120|24.236.65.120]] ([[User talk:24.236.65.120|talk]]) 18:24, 16 June 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

==complete implies Archimedean==
The lead says that the reals can be defined axiomatically as the "complete Archimedean ordered field." The main body of the article, however, gives an axiomatization that simply defines them as a "complete ordered field." The second version is correct, and the word "Archimedean" in the lead should be deleted. The Archimedean property is not independent of completeness. If you make a conservative extension of the reals to a nonarchimedean system, you get the hyperreals, which lack completeness. The Archimedean property is important, but it shouldn't be given in the lead as if it were independent of completeness. You only have to specify whether it's Archimedean if it's not complete. The rationals are Archimedean and not complete; the hyperreals are non-Archimedean and not complete.--[[Special:Contributions/76.167.77.165|76.167.77.165]] ([[User talk:76.167.77.165|talk]]) 15:16, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

In the Advanced Properties section the article claims that the real numbers are everywhere dense. I am familiar with the concept "dense" and "nowhere dense", but not "everywhere dense".

:::::So first of all you should be aware, in general, that Mathworld, while sometimes a useful resource, is, let's say, "quirky". In the case at hand, though, there's nothing I ''disagree'' with in the definitional part of these two articles -- it's just that they never get to an actual definition.
:::::To summarize: The Mathworld articles say that a complex number is ''x+iy'' where ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers; that's fine. "Real number" is linked and says that a real number is either a rational number or an irrational number; this is ''true'' but not a good ''definition'' as it appears to make the notion of an irrational number more fundamental than that of a real number, which is backwards. But it could work if "irrational number were suitably defined. Click on the link to "irrational" and you discover that an "irrational number" is a "number that cannot be expressed as ''p''/''q'' for any integers ''p'' and ''q''." So what then is a "number"? No link to it, and the chain of definitions has terminated with an undefined term, "number", that as I pointed out above, needs further explanation. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 17:39, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

:::: Trovatore, I think there needs to be pointed out that there are multiple definitions for 'real numbers'. For a high school student, the definition would be,,, 'Real' numbers are the union of rational and irrationals, and are essentially the 'number-line' numbers.

:::::The ''term'' is in contradistincton to "imaginary"; that's true, and worthy of mention in the lede, I think. However that doesn't ''define'' it. The "union of the rationals and the irrationals" would define it if you could define the irrationals first, but how are you going to do that? The "number-line" version is a good intuitive motivation, one that I think deserves more emphasis than it currently has (look back in this page or its archives for the discussion of the "Kantian" perspective, which I actually agree with in this case, as little love as I have for Kant's dour philosophy in general). --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 17:37, 30 May 2007 (UTC)
::::You seem to have the idea that the word "number", by itself, is non-problematic, but that isn't so. There are all sorts of things that are or have been occasionally called "numbers" that are not real or complex numbers. A few examples: Transfinite cardinal numbers, transfinite ordinal numbers, hypercomplex numbers, extended real numbers (these include +&infin; and &minus;&infin;), and "numbers" like XBQIRT that identify your reservation at the airport. And even if there weren't all these other meanings of the word "number", there's still the problem that, before it's meaningful to say that a real number is a "number with zero imaginary part", you first have to say what a number is in the first place. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 21:09, 28 May 2007 (UTC)
::: A real number has the property of being a complex number with an imaginary part equal to zero.

:I don't think real numbers should be defined as non-imaginary. But I do think that there should be something in this article that gives examples of non-real numbers. It is quite similar to saying ''an object is a tree if it has leaves and grows.'' While this is true of a tree, bushes also fit this definition yet are not trees.  While it is difficult to make a fully correct definition that does not lead to misnomers, we can still close that gap.  I'm mainly pointing this out because the definition says that "''real numbers include both rational numbers''...''and irrational numbers, such as pi and the square root of two''" but does not point out that the square root of a negative number (square root of negative two) is not a real number while it can still be irrational. I do see that the next paragraph does note that it is difficult to define a real number, but this seems like something that can help clarify rather than including a statement that needs citation after the definition ("''The term "real number" is a retronym coined in response to "imaginary number".''").
:I will note that I do not have a degree in mathematics, but I think it's still a valid point.

"Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite decimal representation (such as that of π above), where the consecutive digits indicate the tenth of an interval given by the previous digits to which the real number belongs."

So what does it mean? Number: 3.1415926'''535'''. The last consecutive digits 535 indicate the tenth of an interval given by 3.1415926 to which the real number belongs (the whole π)? What the hell?

:I agree that the wording is less than clear.  It's clear to ''me'' what it means, but that's because I'm used to the notion of a nested sequence of closed intervals converging on a point; to a reader not familiar with that, the phrasing may be less than helpful.
:Let me explain what it means and then maybe someone can come up with better wording.  The idea is that any initial segment of the decimal representation, say 3.14159, represents an interval that you could round off or truncate to that value, for example the interval [3.141590000...,3.141599999...], where 3.141599999... is an alternative notation for 3.141600000..., I'm using truncation rather than rounding, and I'm giving the interval as closed for a reason that may not matter too much to you (see [[Heine–Borel property]] if you're curious; the intersection of a nested sequence of [[compact set]]s is always nonempty).
:Then the next digit, the 2 in 3.141592, means we have now cut the interval down to a tenth of its previous size, to [3.141592000...,3.141592999...].

== Real numbers as a [[:Category:Belgian inventions|Belgian invention]] ==

[[Simon Stevin]] seems to be being used as the basis for categorizing real numbers as a Belgian invention. However what did he really invent? As a separate question, was it also novel?

There's some evidence for a claim that he invented a decimal notation for real non-integers. This may have some novelty to it.

He also seems to have worked on quadratic solutions. It's not clear if these were for rational real solutions, or for complex number solutions.

It's claimed here that he invented real numbers. Is that based on his notation, or his work with quadratics?  I'm finding it hard (I'm not a mathematician) to see if this justifies a claim for novel invention with rational real numbers (not merely real numbers) from the notation or else for complex numbers from the quadratics. Either way, I'm finding it hard to see his work as being particularly relevant to real numbers specifically.

However, although ''theorems'' are usually easy to attribute to someone, ''notions'', like the notion of real numbers, evolve progressively. As the first definition of the real numbers, which is correct from the modern point of view, is due to Kronecker, much later than Stevin, one could also say that real numbers was invented by Kronecker.

(Fortunately, kids will grow up reading Wikipedia, so hopefully they will learn a correct deviation.) Also, why is "choice" true? and "continuum hypothesis" is neither true or false? -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]])
:Choice is normally assumed to be true because most mathematicians take it as an axiom as it makes life much easier, whereas the continuum hypothesis doesn't affect most normal maths and under some defensible axioms it would be wrong so for instance <math>\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2</math> could also be quite a reasonable conclusion.

:::No, I really think these both miss the point.  Choice is assumed to be true because it's just obviously true.  Once you've understood the motivating picture, you can accept the picture or not, but if you ''do'' accept it, you have to really go out of your way to avoid giving assent to choice.
:::AC is probably the most complicated axiom that is accepted on the basis of self-evidence.  For other axioms (say [[large-cardinal axiom]]s) there are other forms of evidence and justification, but not self-evidence.
:::As to the last question, well, it's just not so that CH is "neither true nor false".  From the POV of a [[mathematical realist]], CH is either true or false, but we probably don't yet know which one.  We may or may not ever know in the future.

== Symbols used for the set of real number ==

Hello, I just did a modification to the page, adding the original character that represents the real numbers: ℝ this is a Unicode character called [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-4.0/U40-2100.pdf the set of real numbers].

Should all the reference to '''R''' be changed to ℝ or this additional note in the article is enough ?

[[User:Egarres|Erik Garres]] 08:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:It's not a good idea to use &#x211D;, as some browsers won't display it. Also, it's not the "original character" for the reals - people were using '''R''' for the reals long before anyone used [[blackboard bold]], and many people still prefer '''R''' (except, perhaps, on blackboards). --[[User:Zundark|Zundark]] 10:56, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

What is <math>\Re</math>? This is used for real axes on the argand diagram, so why not in say sets or other references to <math>\mathbb{R}</math>
--150.101.102.188

:<math>\Re</math> is sometimes used for denoting the real part of a complex number (although <math>\operatorname{Re}</math> is more common for this purpose), which is why you've seen it used to label the real axis of the Argand diagram. It's sometimes used for other (unrelated) things as well. I'm not sure why you think it should be used in references to <math>\mathbb{R}</math>. --[[User:Zundark|Zundark]] 14:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

The article start: "A symbol of the set of real numbers (ℝ)", and the proceeds to use '''R''' for ℝ.  Weird. Can someone point me to a list of "some browsers won't display" (ℝ), it has been over 5 years since this original sub-heading ''"symbols used for the set of real number"'' and (correct me if I am wrong) I suspect that wikipedia has moved on in the mean time and now officially supports ''Unicode 6.2'' fully.  

Keep in mind that in the <s>majority?</s>''many?'' of wikipedia's <nowiki><math> LaTeX sections </math></nowiki> a ℝ is being displayed.  This is producing a weird inconsistency in ℝ notation between wikipedia's text and LaTeX content.

== Zeno's paradoxes ==

A recent discussion I saw on a user talk page on my watchlist reminded me of this:  It's ''very'' odd that [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are not mentioned on this page.  In some sense they are a central part of the reason that the notion of real numbers is important in the first place.  Once you have internalized the reals, it can be hard to understand why anyone would have ever thought they were paradoxical &mdash; but that's because you ''have'' the notion of the reals, and the notion of infinitely many points in an interval of finite length is clearly just true, not a paradox.

Of course, by itself, that doesn't differentiate the reals from (say) the rationals, but the paradoxes lead naturally to the notion of a limit point, and from there, the reals are the next natural stop.

I don't know offhand where to find a good source, but surely there must be one.  I would think this should be treated fairly centrally in the exposition of the motivation for the concept. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 19:57, 5 July 2016 (UTC)

== Axiomatic approach ==

In section {{slink|Real number|Axiomatic approach|nopage=yes}}, the Archimedean property of the reals is not mentioned. I wonder if this is true that a Dedekind-complete ordered field is necessarily Archimedean. If not, Archimedean property must be added to the axioms. If yes, the proof is certainly not immediate, and a hint of the proof or a citation must be provided in this section, because Archimedean property is not a consequence of other notions of completion.

== Notation ==

I wanted, and have included a note on notation as I was looking for '''R'''<sub>++</sub>. 
I am not sure what the best way to include this is.  We can I think have:
: The set of positive numbers is often denoted by '''R'''<sub>+</sub>, or '''R'''<sup>+</sup> or '''R'''<sub>≥0</sub>.
:: But I haven't seen  '''R'''<sup>≥0</sup>.
:The set of negative numbers is often denoted by '''R'''<sub>-</sub>, or '''R'''<sub>≤0</sub>
:: But I haven't seen  '''R'''<sup>≤0</sup>. 
:The set of strictly positive numbers is often denoted by '''R'''<sub>++</sub>, '''R'''<sup>++</sup>   or '''R'''<sub>>0</sub>.
:: But I haven't seen  '''R'''<sup>>0</sup>. 
: The set of strictly negative numbers is often denoted by '''R'''<sub>--</sub> or '''R'''<sub><0</sub>. 
:: But I haven't seen '''R'''<sup>--</sup> or '''R'''<sup><0</sup>. 
Is what is on at the moment OK or does anyone have any suggestions? ([[User:Msrasnw|Msrasnw]] ([[User talk:Msrasnw|talk]]) 14:46, 4 February 2014 (UTC))
:::For the strictly positive numbers, one can also see <math>\bold{R}_+^*</math>, deriving from the fact that the positive reals are the nonzero and nonnegative ones. This notation is rather common in [[Number theory]] where <math>\bold{R}^*</math> is standard for the nonzero reals. [[User:D.Lazard|D.Lazard]] ([[User talk:D.Lazard|talk]]) 15:20, 4 February 2014 (UTC)
::::Zero is not a positive number (see [[sign (mathematics)]]) so '''R'''<sub>≥0</sub> is incorrect for the positive numbers. What distinction are you making between "positive" and "strictly positive"? '''R'''<sup>--</sup> can be found in the reference I gave. While the "++" notation makes sense, I have never seen it used and so would like to see a reference for it. In my experience, the superscripted notation (of single symbols) predominates and subscripts are resorted to when other conventions clash (as [[User:D.Lazard|D.Lazard]] has pointed out above or when a power notation is to be used significantly). However, there is no single standard notation and there may be areas in mathematics which use conventions that I am not familiar with - hence the need for citations.

:In my experience, none of these notations is used much and I don't think it's clear that they are standardized.

== Do real numbers include the rational numbers or not? ==

The introductory paragraph reads "The real numbers include all the rational numbers..."

The first section "Basic Properties" reads "More formally, real numbers have ... the least upper bound property." and then "hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least upper bound property."

Is this a contradiction or am I even dumber than I realize?
[[User:Drienstra|Drienstra]] ([[User talk:Drienstra|talk]]) 00:09, 8 October 2014 (UTC)

:If a set has the least upper bound property, a proper subset of that set doesn't have to have that property (we say that a proper subset doesn't inherit the property in this case). You are pointing to the classical example of this phenomenon. The set of rational numbers less than √2 has lots of rational upper bounds, but no rational least upper bound. The same set, thought of as a set of real numbers has the real number √2 as the least upper bound. To put it another way, given a set with the least upper bound property, if you toss out some elements to get a proper subset, some of the things that you toss could be least upper bounds of some subsets of the proper subset you are left with. This proper subset would then not have the least upper bound property. I hope this helps. [[User:Wcherowi|Bill Cherowitzo ]] ([[User talk:Wcherowi|talk]]) 02:47, 8 October 2014 (UTC)

== Short description ==

I do not oppose to adding a short description, but I have slight reservations to mentioning "[[numberline]]" (even when this is defined as being simply all the reals). I would not have these reservations along an article about "[[constructible numbers]]", but I have, e.g., no immediate (without rectification?) access to locate <math>\pi</math> on the numberline, i.e., to pick up a corresponding length. Maybe, I am off track, but I wanted to articulate my provisos, based on fundamental opposition to the sloppiness in elementary math education.

:Well, "position along a line" represents the reals much better than it does the constructible reals.  A line, intuitively, is connected.  The constructible reals are not connected.  Arguably (and I would very much take this position) the geometric concept of the line is the motivation for the real numbers in the first place, rather than the other way around. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 10:28, 22 February 2018 (UTC)
:Yes; on the line all points are created equal, while numbers are rational or not, algebraic or nor, etc. For Euclid a number was the ratio of two lengths, not a single length (I think so). [[User:Tsirel|Boris Tsirelson]] ([[User talk:Tsirel|talk]]) 10:48, 22 February 2018 (UTC)
::Hmm, yeah, you have a point there, as it were.  I like to mention the "line" because it evokes a couple of things that are distinctive about the reals &mdash; their connectedness, which distinguishes them from the integers or the rationals (or the constructible numbers), and their dimensionality, which distinguishes them from the complex numbers.
::But you're correct that there are objections that could be made, and we can't handle them in a "short" description.

::::::"Continuous" is not wrong. The objection of {{u|Macrakis}} would be valid if "representing" would mean "characterizing", which is not the case. "Measuring" could be better than "representing" (an area is a real number). However, it could be confusing, as suggesting implicitly a physical process and a limited accuracy. Therefore I suggest to keep "representing", but I would not oppose to change it to "measuring". [[User:D.Lazard|D.Lazard]] ([[User talk:D.Lazard|talk]]) 07:42, 23 February 2018 (UTC)

Thanks for ridding the number line. Maybe it is just my native language, which lets me prefer "numbers forming a continuum", because of allowing "continuity" also on discrete topologies. [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy]] ([[User talk:Purgy Purgatorio|talk]]) 09:47, 23 February 2018 (UTC)

== can't depict algorithms on the number line, only their approximate instantiations ==

Hi, I would like to suggest an important correction to the number line you displayed.  Please remove PI, sqrt(2), gamma and e as they are not numbers but algorithms. These algorithms have no definite values only approximations.  The latter may be depicted on the number line, but algorithms which produce endless sequences of approximations have no home there.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Counting floats|Counting floats]] ([[User talk:Counting floats#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Counting floats|contribs]]) 18:37, 2 March 2018 (UTC)</small>

:They are most definitely (real) numbers.  That there are algorithms to compute them to arbitrary accuracy means they are [[computable number]]s (more or less).  Where did you get the idea that they aren't real numbers, or that they can't be displayed on a number line?  &ndash;[[User:Deacon Vorbis|Deacon Vorbis]]&nbsp;([[User Talk:Deacon Vorbis|carbon]]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Deacon Vorbis|videos]]) 19:06, 2 March 2018 (UTC)

Thank you very much for responding and explaining your point of view.

Well, in the case of PI for example they have generated 5 billion digits or so of it. Each which can be appended to 3.14 to form the 
next better approximation.  Which one of these 5 billion are you going to depict on the number line? The first couple, or all of them ? 
You can't stick the Greek letter Pi onto the real number line anywhere because it stands for an algorithm not for a real number.
But let's say that when you annotate a position on the number line with the string "Pi" you meant only the best known approximation of it which is 3.14 Fine. But 3.14 can also be produced by an uncountable number of other algorithms or tricks e.g. 31.4/10 or  sqrt(9.8596) or 3 + 0.1 + 0.04, and so on.
Thus 3.14 cannot possibly be paired with or reserved for a single well-known algorithm. The only thing 3.14 can stand for is 314 beads each which has the size 1/100 of the unity bead.

There is a reason we named the number line the "NUMBER" line and not the "any algorithm" line.  It should have only real numbers with an exceptionally tight set of syntax rules.
These should not be open for interpretation or haphazard change and should cover both the integers and the floating point numbers. 
But that is a subject for another day.

As to where I got the idea, thank you for asking.  I am a smart guy, can think for myself and figured it out. 

I hope this helps to clarify my position.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Counting floats|Counting floats]] ([[User talk:Counting floats#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Counting floats|contribs]]) 22:02, 2 March 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:It must be nice to know that you are what you call a "smart guy", but the entities you refer to are very good examples of what in mathematics is defined as the concept of "real number". Certainly there are algorithms for calculating successively better approximate values for π, but that does not mean that π is one of those algorithms. It is not entirely easy to understand what you are trying to say, but it looks very much as though you are conceiving the real number line as consisting as a discrete set of points, each representable by a finite number of decimal figures, but the real number line as understood in mathematics is not discrete. Your comment about floating point numbers is completely off the point, because "floating point" is merely a way of representing numbers in a computer, and not part of the mathematical concept of real number. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 22:36, 2 March 2018 (UTC)
:<br> (ec) Hi [[User:Counting floats]].  The viewpoint presented in this article is the standard one in mathematics, and the article, appropriately, presents the standard view.  That is not going to change.
:There are alternative views that have something in common with the notions that I suspect you have in mind.  You might be interested in [[ultrafinitism]].  It is appropriate for the article to discuss heterodox views such as ultrafinitism, but not as the main thrust of the article.  I haven't checked recently whether the article discusses ultrafinitist approaches to the real numbers.  If it does not, or if the coverage is inadequate, you are welcome to present reliable sources and suggest changes (or even make them yourself, but I don't really recommend making them yourself, because I think it needs a deeper understanding of the topic than I judge you to have, apologies if I'm incorrect about that).

Well, confining myself to positive base-10 decimal case (to keep it simple ) : My understanding of integers is any string which has some mix of
ten digits from 0 to 9, provided that there is no leading zero. For decimal floats the string may have the 10 digits and the decimal point in any mix provided that a few syntax rules are followed. Won't elaborate them here, except to say that you will recognize an incorrect float when you see one (e.g. : 00..0.5 and so on ). Note that floats existed long before computers, for the sole purpose to increase the resolution of computing and measurement without limits. That is what the meaning of the implied digits on the right side of the decimal point representing negative powers of the base.

Yes, I am aware of the real number definition with integers, floats and an open-ended mix of algorithms added in. 
I fully understand that, however this will have to change, not just on Wikipedia but in the entire mathematical community. 
Algorithms are a vast open collection of mathematics in action whose outputs are recorded as integers, floats, musical notes, colors, 
spatial measurements, behaviors you name it they do it. Floats are just one of many ways of expressing the logic of human thought.
To lump algorithms side by side with floats or colors simply makes no sense as they must respect the cause and effect hierarchy.

Thank you for your time, it was an interesting exchange, cleared up some things for me.

No problem I was just testing an idea, you are right, it is not going to be decided here on Wiki. 
Making the change is not going to matter one-way or another. 

I appreciate that you only insinuated that I am a novice about reals, floats and algorithms but did not
call me names. I have seen worse on your Talk pages.
You did help me out considerably and that I appreciate.

However, if you don't have anything better to do I have a question for you :
Pretend that you are given a job of placing the algorithmic output(s) of PI on the number line.
Where would you put it ? I am not testing just curious. 
That was my original question I meant to ask but somehow I got sidetracked a bit.

::Thanks, this really useful theorem did not belong to my knowledge! :) Well, I tried to argue that "elementary" intuition about an object, vaguely introduced as "number line", does not suffice as a base for introducing concepts like "dense" rationals, for "interjacent" algebraic numbers, and also not for "completion" by the rest, and -all together- does not suffice for making up the "connected continuum" of reals. This is the basis for me objecting to the "number line" as a good means to "introduce" or to shortly "describe" reals. Re the {{pi}}-marking I stated already in my first remark on short descriptions that rectification (of the wheels circumference) does not provide an "immediate access" to a point on a line.

Every mathematical discourse consists of two parts. One is the intuitive part, aimed to support intuition and to explain what is done. Every figure belongs to this part. The second part is the formal part, consisting of axioms, definitions, statement of theorems and proofs. Mathematical texts that are reduced to their formal part are boring and can be understood only by people who know the subject. On the other hand, a mathematical text reduced to its intuitive part is non-scientific, as there is no way for validate or invalidate its content.

The [[Real line]] cannot be properly defined, and one can prove nothing about it. It belongs to the intuitive part of the mathematical discourse, and has been introduced only for helping intuition and motivation. As the real line may not be properly defined, it is not a mathematical object, and nothing can be proven about it. On the other hand, the set of real numbers can be formally defined (the definition is not really elementary, but this is life :-). Thus, it belongs to the formal part of the discourse. 

IMO, the main flaw in {{u|Counting floats}}'s post, is that it does not make any distinction between the intuitive and the formal discourse, and tries to prove (or disprove) assertions on something for which this is a nonsense.

This article is currently inconsistent in notation. The first half uses blackboard bold ℝ throughout, but the second half uses bold '''R''' almost everywhere. The article ought to be self-consistent.

== Quantity along the line ==

I attempted to improve the opening sentence of the article by replacing the hand-waving phrase, "quantity along the line," with the more precise phrase, "position on the real line." Editor [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy Purgatorio]] then reverted my edit without giving a specific reason, saying only, "rather no improvement," (what is "rather" supposed to mean here?). So let me explain my edit here in more detail, in preparation for restoring it.

First, the word ''line'' has many meanings in mathematics. The phrase ''the line'' is generally understood by math-literate readers to refer to the real line, but the present article is addressed to general readers, so it seems reasonable to use the more specific term here. Second, the idea of "quantity along a line" could be taken to mean any function of position, but here we simply mean the position, so why not just say it that way?  [[User:Eleuther|Eleuther]] ([[User talk:Eleuther|talk]]) 09:05, 9 May 2018 (UTC) 

: Re-reverting a new edit is generally not the recommended way, taking it to the TP is good.
: "rather" is to mean that I do not like the previous wording very much either, your suggestion is no noticeable improvement, imho.
: Introducing "real numbers" via referring to a "real line" is a logical no-no.
: I deny that "real number" is about a position, but is ''rather'' (again) about a quantity in first sight.

OK, taking a deep breath here.  I have to object to [[User:D.Lazard]] removing the longstanding language about the reals being quantities along a line.  That is the ''essence'' of the reals.  It's what the ancient Greeks had in mind (though they didn't know it at the time).  It can be found in all sorts of sources as the first description of the reals.  By comparison, "measurable quantity" doesn't mean anything.  ("Continously varying quantity" would be slightly better, I guess, but I really think we should start with the line, which is the ur-example of the reals.) --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 09:59, 9 May 2018 (UTC)

:Yes, I vaguely recall seeing in some text on the history of math, that the idea of "continuously varying quantity" (in the context of the emergent notion of function) was the reason to drop the former idea that each number should have individual name.

::"Longstanding" is not a valid argument for Wikipedia discussions. The historical and philosophical relationship between real numbers and positions on a line is an interesting question, but this would require sources, and, in any case does belong to the first sentence of the lead. By the way Euclides did not use numbers for marking a position on a line—this was invented by Descartes—, but he used them for measuring distances, which is clearly not the same. Similarly, {{u|Trovatore}}'s opinion about the ''essence'' of the reals has nothing to do here.
::The possible readers of this article include all physicists, engineers, and computer scientist. For them, the reference to a line is not useful and possibly confusing as their use of the reals is not generally related to geometry (for example, they use reals for the time and the [[energy]]). As WP is an encyclopedia, the first sentence must be significant for almost every reader. Such a common background is clearly provided by the use of reals for [[measurement]]. I agree that "measurable quantity" is not a best choice for that. "Continously varying quantity" is worse, as many measured quantities do not vary. On the other hand the phrase "continuous quantity" appears many times in [[Quantity]]. Therefore, I'll replace "measurable quantity" by "[[quantity|continuous quantity]]".
