== Telefónica blurb ==

I have a couple of issues with this blurb:

== 
In 2013, the Spanish Government would have dampened a friendly takeover attempt of AT&T on Telefónica, valued in 122,000 million euros. Such an impediment would be justified in the strategic nature of the company and AT&T would have taken a step backward.[11] 
==

# I have a hard time parsing this.  What does this mean exactly? Who was to take over whom?  
# It seems highly speculative and vague.  For instance, what does "''...would have taken a step backward''" refer to?
# Why is this blurb shown in such a prominent place in the article?   It is, at best, of regional interest, not critical to the (history of the) company as a whole...   Perhaps a separate "subsidiaries" type section would do?

== Edits regarding the Time Warner purchase ==
As you all know, AT&T now 100% own the company formerly known as Time Warner Inc. (and all it divisions and subsidiaries) as of June 14th, 2018. AT&T page  needs a complete makeover plus that chart is outdated. AT&T Media as it informally known until we know the new name also need a total makeover on it page. We can all do this. 

Thanks,
BBMatBlood. 07:25, 15 June 2018 (UTC)

:A) do not shout in section headers, nor make them vague. I've changed the header to fix that. B) the purchase is not yet complete, and we don't know the final details.

== First sentence  ==

Hi all, I recently made an edit to the first line of the article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AT%26T&diff=859967274&oldid=859960510]

*'''AT&T Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[holding company]] headquartered at [[Whitacre Tower]] in [[Downtown Dallas]], [[Texas]].

however [[User:General_Ization]] reverted the edit, stating: 

''AT&T Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate holding company, as previously stated.''

on their 2nd revert, after seeking clarification for the reason why.

Rather than get into an edit war, it would be better to come to consensus amongst the community. I think a more sentence of what the company does would be better.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Angryskies|Angryskies]] ([[User talk:Angryskies#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Angryskies|contribs]]) 14:00, 17 September 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Old AT&T Corp (American Telephone & Telegraph Co) became New AT&T Inc. (Southwestern Bell/SBC)... ==

In every sense from owning the former parent, taking it name, logo, stock ticker, and claiming origins going back to 1885 (see Xander page, see 25th Anniversary of AT&T prediction). We could merge or not merge both pages since it will be unprecedentedly long but if CBS Corp. founded in 2006 can trace it history to that of Westinghouse which rename to CBS in 1997 then same thing here or even look at Atari,SA (formerly Infogrammes) and Atari,Inc (originating from Nolan Bushnell original company). with the only exceptions in this type of corporate structure (working on a name for it lol; working title is Old Brand becomes New: Father becomes Son. The tales of AT&T, CBS, Atari, and THQ) are THQ Nordic AB (Nordic Games) and THQ Inc. (formerly Toy Headquarters); Broadcom Inc. (formerly Avago Technologies) and Broadcom Corporation. Thank you.[[User:BBMatBlood|BBMatBlood]] ([[User talk:BBMatBlood|talk]]) 03:53, 7 January 2019 (UTC)
:I do not agree with merging articles about two distinctly different companies. These articles have remained separate for over 13 years since SBC acquired AT&T Corp. Plenty of citations are made throughout the article detailing the separate identity of AT&T Inc.

==Older comments==
I have seen various dates for founding of the current AT&T - 2005, 1984, 1885, and 1877. Which is it?
*According to this [http://www.sbc.com/Common/files/pdf/logo_evolution_factsheet.pdf PDF file],  1885 is when the AT&T was formed as a subsidary to the American Bell Telephone Co. In 1984, AT&T was broken up into baby bells which contain Southwestern Bell (later became SBC when it acquired a couple of other former baby bells). I think the reason why Wikipedia is listing it as 1877 because of the original parent company of AT&T was founded in that year. --[[User:J. Nguyen|J. Nguyen]] 01:01, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

== history ==

A lot of the history here is the same as in the [[Bell System]] article.  Obviously, they shouldn't be merged, but maybe this one should be shortened and reference the Bell System article?

== AT&T | SBC Merger ==

The founded date shouuld be November 28,2005 because the company created in 1887 ceased to exsist on that date.
:The King is Dead, Long Live the King.  The original company may have ceased to exist on the financial books, but the article still refers to it, and all the assets of the AT&T that existed on November 27, 2005 are now part of the new company.  We need to keep history in perspective. [[User:Chadlupkes|Chadlupkes]] 14:25, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

== Wheres SBC? ==

This article does a great job describing AT&T up until the point of the merge, however it lacks enough information about the company SBC which is what AT&T has become. There should be a seperate article specifically about SBC before its name change, and what it was before being combined with AT&T. I suggest we pull up the old SBC article and use it for that purpose. --[[User:69.232.197.133|69.232.197.133]] 03:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

:I don't see a problem using the SBC article as a "History" article.  Besides, it was SBC who bought AT&T, not the other way around, and I feel this fact gets lost in the article in it's current format.[[User:Dknights411|Dknights411]] 06:38, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Intro ==

Why does the intro refer to "local long distance"? I thought it was a mistake, but the [[Long distance]] article says there is such a thing. But doesn't AT&T do regular long distance as well? [[User:Wkdewey|Wkdewey]] 01:42, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

== Summation that may be of interest ==

I've prepared [http://khavrinen.csail.mit.edu/t.html a summary of what happened to the equity investors in the old AT&amp;T], from the perspective of a hypothetical investor who purchased 100 shares in 1970.  My summary is not [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] and is to some extent [[WP:NOR|original research]], so I'm not going to put it in the article directly, but the information there may be of some utility to future editors of this article.  (Note that I explicitly exclude dividends, which are much more difficult to account for, particularly when converting to constant dollars.)

== Popular Science's Flowchart For AT&T? ==

I remember a while back...I think in 2003...[[Popular Science]] had a flowchart that depicted the consumption of AT&T that occurred.  I went on the website for the archives, but alas, they only have articles only as far back as 2004.

== NSA controversy ==

There are two paragraphs:

* '''2006''' - Records (not recordings) of calls were sent to the NSA

== Wired Leaks NSA/AT&T Spying Documents ==

Maybe this document and related information should be added to this story;

Basicly, this PDF file details how the NSA is wiretapping on internet traffic by splitting optical cables.

I think it is fine.

Just thinking ahead, this same situation is going to happen on the Cingular article.  Because it follows the path: AT&T Wireless + Cingular ---> Cingular --> AT&T Wireless(eventually) all of the old information about AT&T Wireless (existing info) might become cannibalized when Cingular becomes re-merged back into AT&T Wireless' article down the road.

== Competitors??? ==

On every RBOC page, AT&T, BellSouth, Verizon, and Qwest, there is a section "Comepetitors", and in each is listed the other RBOCS, as well as various independant ILECs. The independants I could see, as they may be a CLEC in various Bell areas, but the RBOCs do not compete with eachother, in other words, they don't intrude on eachother's turf for LEC service.

I think the competitors section on the RBOC pages are irrelevant, inaccurate, and incomplete (they list few if any of the actual CLECs that "compete" with the Bell company), and irrelevant.

Considering that the "new" AT&T owns all of the original assets, and that it is a separate company in law only versus principle, I think that we should merge the old and the new. AT&T is an old company with a lot of history, so I don't think we should demote the old one on basis of technicality. [[User:Telepheedian|Telepheedian]] 18:15, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
:I '''agree''', and this is how it once was. AT&T and former AT&T company coverage on Wikipedia is a mess, and a certain Wikiproject focused only on pre-84 AT&T is doing more harm than good, for one reason is that its one man band sees more distinction than really exists between pre-84 AT&T and the post-84 companies, and that pre-84 AT&T was composed of many seperate subsidiaries, all of which currently exist as they always have under AT&T, Verizon, Qwest, Lucent-Alcatel, Avaya, Telcordia, and Advanced American Telephones/VTech.

:I suggest '''keeping them separate''' The old company has enough history that people in the future (say 50 years from now) may want to access info on the forner "Ma Bell" as it was.  If you merge the two no matter how you try- eventually much of the old history will get lost in time and you may not have a resource to find info on the old "Ma Bell".  Ofcourse it's not totally gone you can always pay companies like "FT.com" or "Hoovers.com" to see defunct company profiles but it would be nice if there were also free open source profiiles on major companies like AT&T which did leave a huge mark on the country.

::What do you mean, Bentoman? The article on the old company is "American Telephone & Telegraph Company" and the new one "AT&T".

:I '''agree''' to the merging of the articles. Consolidation of information CAN BE DONE PROPERLY in such a way that the histories of all pre-merger companies can be properly preserved in a merged article. Yes, it will take some effort, but its a worthwhile effort nonetheless. Having multiple articles for different companies/corporations that has a common history and are now operating as one can lead to confusion/misunderstanding on the part of people unfamiliar to the topic.

:'''No.''' There are clearly problems with the articles as they are, but merging them will only make matters worse. The current AT&T&T article needs to be simplified, not made more complicated, and much of the content moved to more appropriate pages. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 23:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
::Simplification and merging are not mutually exclusive. --[[User:Dystopos|Dystopos]] 00:14, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
:::I disagree completely. The two companies are barely related, the original AT&T has a long history that would be required for any encyclopedia covering the topic, and the new company is a diverse collection of different operations that, again, need to be covered by the encyclopedia. Merging two complex articles, about two entities that share little but a name and one being made up ''in part'' of ''some of the'' components of the other, strikes me as bound to cause even more confusion and more complexity. We need to keep them seperate, we need to simplify this article - which fundamentally is about SBC - and move much of the information out of it.
:::And, FWIW, if we were to merge the two, why not also merge it with [[Verizon]] and [[Qwest]]? Because neither bought the ''name''? If the intent is to show where the old AT&T is today, then that would make sense. But again, we're looking at turning two already complex articles into a major messfest.

:'''No''' As mentioned before, these are two different companies: AT&T, Inc. and AT&T Corp. Besides the technical part of this, AT&T Inc., the new company, seems to be doing a lot of marketing to reimage them selves as a "new" company (i.e. "We are not your mother's Ma Bell").

:'''No''' The only reason I see to merge them is that the new corporation took a similar name as the old one. Think about it like this: when a corporation buys out another corporation, do we merge the articles? The old AT&T has such a huge history, legacy, and much more. When another corporation takes over AT&T's ''assets'', do they take over everything else that corporation had, like its history? No. Hell, if we merged articles everytime a corporation bought out another corporation, we'd have something like two articles on telephone companies.

== Bell logo. ==

*AT&T Co. was not allowed to use the bell logo after 1984.
Does anyone know if AT&T Inc. is allowed to use the bell logo now?

:*I thought the new swirling globe logo was just a rebranding for Ma Bell in the 90's, e.g. e.g. when AT&T starting becoming a Cable provider and the like and needed a logo that was no longer just about the "bell" a.k.a. old long distance and POTS system. [[User:CaribDigita|CaribDigita]] 03:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

::*I think technically, the new AT&T could use the Bell logo, since the logo was authorized to all the Baby Bell, and in reality the new AT&T is really SBC rebranded.  Just as you mention about the old AT&T wanting to move away from LDT and POTS back in the 90s, I don't think we'll ever see the current company use the logo, other than in a historic sense.  AT&T wants customers to see them as more than just a phone company, which the Bell logo is pretty much the icon for.  In addition, I'm sure AT&T wants to distance itself from as many similarities of the old Bell System as possible, keeping those in government from getting any ideas of repeating 1984 all over again.  --[[User:Brownings|Brownings]] 03:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

:::*AT&T is allowed to use the Bell logo and name, and does use in a sense, that it licenses it to Conairphone for their Southwestern Bell Freedom phone brand: http://www.swbfreedomphone.com/, also they still use it for the time being in BellSouth Telecommunications territory, and payhones that still sport the Bell logo on signs is considered active use.

A services section was added to the main article, which encompasses AT&T services. The addition of this section is not needed as it can already be found throught the holdings that AT&T Inc. holds as subsidiary links. If this were to be kept, it only provides confusion as it is first incomplete. The list covers mostly former SBC and Bellsouth services, and neglects that of the original AT&T Corp. (ex. DSL neglects to include AT&T Worldnet, which is till in wide use and sale). This section only adds for confusion. ----kungfuazn

Anyone aware of an official Wikipedia policy/mechanism for locking pages against merger requests? --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 15:27, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

I think that one point of confusion might be coming from the '''newatt.gif''' graphic on the page.  It shows the old AT&T being broke up into five parts and then the five coming back together.  What it doesn't show are the other parts of the old AT&T that became Verizon and Quest (and other part) that have not remerged.  As a result, one who is not familiar with the telecomunications industry changes might not realize that the '''New AT&T''' is not just a rebirth of the old.  Perhaps the '''RBOCs_Dec_06.jpg''' graphic from the [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] article should be used, or perhaps a new one that shows the 'lost parts.'

And if you think its confusing on the outside, hell, I'm still wondering when I'll get my new uniforms to replace my [[BellSouth]] ones.--[[User:Ravenhull|Donovan Ravenhull]] 17:13, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

This appears to be the image you're talking about:

[[Image:RBOCs_Dec_06.jpg|thumb|320px|This diagram shows how the various RBOC companies have changed due to mergers and acquisitions since the 1984 breakup.]]

I see what you mean although I find the diagram a little confusing. It makes sense once you understand the logic but the temptation is to look at it as a series of confusing paths with AT&T turning into Bell Atlantic, and then NYNEX, and then USWEST, etc...

Maybe there's a way to alter the existing graphic to make it more obvious that there are:

(a) Parts of "the new" at&t that were never part of the Bell System.
(b) Major parts of the old Bell System that are not part of "the new" at&t but have equal claim to be the "successor".

==Founding date==
Someone continues to vandalize the corporate infobox changing the founding date of AT&T from 1983 to 2005. There is a disclaimer explaining the "1983" date; a similar disclaimer exists on the [[CBS Corporation]] page. This user is anonymous, and each time the date is changed a new IP address is used. [[User:KansasCity|KansasCity]] 04:28, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

I agree with your logic, and the IP user should quit doing this. Assuming this is the consensus here, and the user continues to make these changes, perhaps we need to temporarily lock the page against anonymous edits? --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 12:24, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Wrong Founding Date ==

This page continues to list the date AT&T was founded as 1983.  This is untrue.  Even the AT&T Corporate Website does not list the company starting in 1983 but rather in the 1880s.  SBC was PART of AT&T.  Someone just doesn't get that!!
:American Telephone and Telegraph were founded then.  This 'AT&T' is a different corparate entity.  In effect, when the devestiture happened, the company was 'reset' when it came to founding dates and such.--[[User:Ravenhull|Donovan Ravenhull]] 09:56, 4 June 2007 (UTC)
:SBC was founded in 1983, it was created as part of the AT&T break-up, and "the new" AT&T is merely a renamed SBC.. The AT&T Corporate Website is somewhat misleading as it's talking about the total history of many of the component entities, not of the current legal corporation. I'll change the page back to 1983 when I get back in to work (can't edit large pages from home for some reason.) --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 11:04, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

Wait- so, I guess the AT&T corporation is wrong and Squiggleslah is right?  I would think that since it is THEIR corporation, that is the date that should be used on Wikipedia!!  Oh and the AT&T, inc corporation started in 2005.  So 1885 or 2005 should be the correct date!

More interesting facts.  According to Hoover's Corporate Guide (which is the source used for the 1983 founding date) it says this: "Is it Ma Bell's revenge? AT&T, the matronly telecom icon broken apart in 1984 after a landmark antitrust case, is reuniting the Bell family. AT&T Inc. (formerly SBC Communications) was formed in 2005 when former Baby Bell SBC bought AT&T Corp. for some $16 billion, creating the largest telecom outfit in the US. After the merger, SBC adopted the globally familiar AT&T moniker."  Seems like the date is 2005 after all!

:The basis of this dispute comes down to the fact that the current company, named "AT&T Inc." was '''incorporated''', or '''founded''' in '''[[1983]]''' as '''[[Southwestern Bell Corporation]]'''. That company changed its name to [[SBC Communications]], Inc. in [[1995]], and began its buying spree. It then acquired [[AT&T Corporation]] in [[2005]] and '''changed its name''' to '''AT&T Inc.''', and '''did not''' reincorporate itself. The only reason AT&T claims that it is a "new" company formed in 2005 is so that people will look at the current AT&T, formerly SBC Communications, in a new light as not to confuse the American public with the '''old''' AT&T, which was incorporated in 1885. And the corporate guide I have referred to is '''not''' the Internet version, but the actual multi-book reference set found at the public library, which also lists Verizon Communications' date of incorporation as in 1983. If I am mistaking this reference set as the Hoover's guide, then I will make that change after I get to the library again. The AT&T we know today has started in 2005, as in that it started branding itself as AT&T. The name change dispute can also be seen on pages such as [[CBS Corporation]], which is similar in that the child company takes on its former parents' name (Viacom, now CBS, was spun off from the original CBS in 1971). Also, the comments regarding the AT&T founding as being 2005 are not being signed. [[User:KansasCity|KansasCity]] 03:55, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

I have personally emailed and will call AT&T corporate headquarters.  I have asked them what is their official founding year.  As Wikipedia tries to be as accurate as possible, I can only hope the SBC-crowd will respect what AT&T corporate answers with.  Therefore if AT&T says, 1983 then its 1983, if they say 1885, then its 1885, if they say 2005, then it 2005.  I would also say since this is in "dispute" all three years should be listed until it has benn settled!

What is so hilarious is that the "SBC" crowd on Wikipedia doesn't get the fact SBC was PART of AT&T.  What's even funnier is that the AT&T Corporate Website and the Bell System Memorial Website (which is a top notch site) all list the companies founding from the 1880s.  So SBC, the new AT&T or whatever will ALWAYS have its roots in the original company.  Its a shame that some of you just don't get it! You are giving Wikipedia a bad name!-RL

:This article is about the corporation that started out as Southwestern Bell, and ended up as AT&T. You wouldn't vandalize the Verizon and Qwest articles to claim they were also all founded in the 1880s now, would you?
:To be honest, this looks like a stunt being pulled by the same mob that's always trying to get this article merged with [[American Telephone & Telegraph]]. If you can't get what you want, ie the articles formally merged, then start merging them right now anyway. Correct?
:As for asking AT&T, as we pointed out earlier, AT&T's comments are irrelevent. It's talking about the total history of the component entities. It's talking, essentially, about the history of the Bell System. You are being actively dishonest by claiming I'm saying AT&T is "wrong", I'm saying they're answering a different question. It's as appropriate to put a founding date of 1880 on this article, this one here, this one about SBC (renamed to AT&T because that's their current name) as it would be to claim T-Mobile was created in [[Reichspost|1495]]. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 12:40, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

::People. There is no straightforward answer to this, and the best solution is probably to list all these dates in the infobox, as is done in other cases. It's true, the current entity came into being in 1983 as a result of the breakup of the Bell System; however, AT&T is far from being the only company to insist that it began with an earlier company, and as it retains the name and most of the assets of this company, this should also be mentioned. It's not like the post-1983 AT&T was the only company that could claim its origins in 1885; all of the Baby Bells could, even if their corporate entity was brand new at the time, the RBOCs were themselves much older. It would be misleading to list only one date, and we have sources indicating all of them. Thus, I would suggest:

::1885 (Original AT&T)
::1983 (Southern Bell Corporation)
::1995 (Renamed SBC)
::2005 (Merger with AT&T, AT&T name adopted)

::Hope this helps settle things.

:::I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise that'll satisfy everyone, but it would be actively misleading to post four dates. This page is about a specific corporation. The 1880 date applies to [[American Telephone & Telegraph]], but not SBC. SBC was renamed several times, but none of these renames can legitimately be described as a "founding" date.
:::Essentially, the only way it would be appropriate to put multiple dates in would be if we were going to merge this article (together with [[Verizon]] and [[Qwest]]) with [[American Telephone & Telegraph]], making an article about everything that has ever been vaguely related to the Bell System.

:::Minor nit-pick.  SBC was 'Southwestern Bell Corporation', not 'Southern Bell' which was one of the two halves of the old BellSouth.--[[User:Ravenhull|Donovan Ravenhull]] 15:17, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

Interesting that whenever compromise is mentioned people get hung up on not wanting to compronmise.  I agree, multiple dates should be used for this web page.  SBC corporation WAS AT&T, which started in 1880.  It is also ridiculous to say that it doesn't matter what AT&T corporate says.  I guess some Wikipedia user has the right to determine a companies history more than AT&T itself.  SO, since it became AT&T inc in 2005 and there are seperate wiki pages on SBC (1985) and AT&T (1880), there is no reason the infobox should not be 2005.

: Something is not an acceptable compromise if it doesn't actually solve the issue (indeed, it makes matters worse) for one of the parties. In this case, saying SBC, which is ultimately what this article is about, was "founded" in 1880, 1983, and 2005, isn't in any way accurate. This article is about a specific corporation, that was founded in 1983. Like I said, you wouldn't say T-Mobile was founded in 1495. The Reichspost was, and DT, which created T-Mobile, is a direct decedent. In that respect, it has a greater claim to being founded in 1495 than a company founded in 1983 due to a court ordered break-up does. Why would you claim SBC was "founded" in 1880?
: And no, it doesn't matter what AT&T "says" when it's ADDRESSING AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TOPIC.
: If you're going to pretend to be doing something other than trolling, perhaps you can address that issue rather than continuing to pretend AT&T's website is describing something other than the history of the Bell System. Perhaps you can also start arguing on T-Mobile's site that the founding date should be changed to 1495. You'd at least be being consistent.
: I was unaware that there's a separate article about [[SBC Communications]]. That page should be merged into this one, it's redundant. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 12:43, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

That is the most ridiculous argument I ever heard.  Arguing T-Mobile started in 1495 is not the same as arguing that the NEW AT&T started in 2005.  What did you flunk debating class?  Look at your own chart you SBC-lovers put up.  There is an AT&T at the top, a whole bunch of Baby Bells in the middle and then an AT&T at the bottom.  I am no math expert, but if AT&T is at the top & bottom of a flow chart, then they must be the same in some way!!  SBC IS AT&T.  It was a company spun off of AT&T when the Govt forced the break-up.  SBC's total history is AT&T's history.  Why don't you get that.  SBC is no more.  They took the AT&T name for a reason...GREAT HISTORY!!  SBC being founded in 1983 is BOGUS.  Their history goes back WAY before that as the were a Bell Operating Company under AT&T.  Learn your HISTORY!!  As for 2005, when AT&T merged with SBC, they became a NEW COMPANY!!! Since you choose not to compromise I guess its back to square one- RL3  (BTW: Why are CITED/SOURCED items being deleted from the article??)

:Sorry, but history may play a role in the industry, but corporate history cannot be changed. Corporate lineage does not mean that all spinoffs' founding dates are automatically the same as the former parents'. If you claim that the current AT&T Inc., incorporated in 1983 was actually incorporated in 1885, why not go to the [[Embarq]] page and change its founding date to [[1899]]? Why not change the founding date of [[Lucent Technologies (old company)|Lucent]] to 1872? Genworth Financial to [[1878]]? [[CBS Corporation]] to [[1922]]? In the case of the AT&T buyout by SBC Communications, SBC adopted a new name. They did not, however, '''reincorporate''', which would be what belongs in the corporate infobox. If there is some sort of documentation that shows that AT&T Inc. actually filed documents of reincorporation in the state of [[Delaware]] in [[2005]] when it bought [[AT&T Corp.]], then bring it forward and feel free to change the founding date. However, those do not exist, because AT&T '''did not''' reincorporate itself like [[Viacom (1971-2005)|Viacom]] did in [[1986]], hence the reason on the [[CBS Corporation]] page its founding date is not stated as being 1971; rather, it was 1986.

:Also, if this topic is so important to you, why not become a registered user where you might gain some sort of credibility?[[User:KansasCity|KansasCity]] 04:27, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

I am a registered user but am not logged in.  That is the MAJOR problem with Wikipedia and people like yourself that think your are Wikipedia gods.  Your statement that only a "registered" user has such little credibility in itself.  I always though Wikipedia was designed for ANYONE to edit.  I guess in your world only the "registered" matter on Wikipedia!!  As for your argument, stop all of your nonsense mumbo jumbo legal talk.  This is the REAL WORLD.  If AT&T considers their founding date to be in 1880, if AT&T considers SBC as a part of their company, so does the rest of the average people (or maybe I should say non-registred users) of the world.  Why do you keep deleting parts of the article that give a different point of view than your own and that are SOURCED?  Are you the same guy who said we have a strong consenus vote earlier when it was 6-4, or that the voting has been suspended before the time that was announced.  Is this Wikipedia or Stalinpedia?-RL

Vandalism is not when someone puts a differing story that is actually BACKED BY SOURCES!

Backed by sources? The disclaimer, explaining in full detail why the legal entity named AT&T Inc. today was actually founded in 1983, is sourced by 3 sources, including an official legal proceeding. Notice the title: '''AT&T Inc. (f/k/a SBC Communications, Inc.'''). '''F/K/A''' means "formerly known as", indicating an official legal name change. [[User:KansasCity|KansasCity]] 03:42, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Whatever Joesph Stalin.  Your SOURCE is Hoover's Corporate Guide, which on-line lists the date as 2005.  You have shown zero actual proof of any of your claims, and have made response such as AT&T Coroporate HQ has it wrong!  AT&T Inc may have been incorporated in 1983, but it certainly was not founded then!  It was founded in 1885.  SBC was part of the orgiginal AT&T.  The WHOLE AT&T (including SBC) has a history that starts in 1885!  Why do you think they took the AT&T name?  beacuse the history comes with it!!  Why do you think their corporate web site talks about 1885 and lists all of AT&T's accomplishments from that time to the present.  Everyone KNOWS that this company has a long, rich history, which you all for some reason deny.  (I asssuming with names like Kansas City you are bitter midwesterners that are upset the SBC name was dropped).  Using your argument, the Cleveland Browns football team starts in 1999.  Wrong, everyone takes their FULL history.  Obvsiously, you all do not want to compromise in any way and its basically, your right and any differing opinions are wrong.  We can only help Wikipedia flags this article for neutrality!!  It is people like you that give Wikipedia a bad name.  Your Soviet-era mentality by not letting others have a voice is probably why most educators DO NOT allow their students to use Wikipedia as a source!

:Gee, almost have an incarnation of [[Godwin's Law]] here.  SBC took the AT&T name because the name had a history.  Also, if you are this motivated by your thoughts on this, register and/or sign your posts.--[[User:Ravenhull|Donovan Ravenhull]] 10:32, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

Yeah, Donovan too bad no one mentioned Hilter or the Nazis, you may want to think before posting.  Not allowing opposing points of view is a very Soviet-type (non-democrcatic) way of doing things.  But it seems as though you are another Wikipedia elitist that think registering makes the difference.  The internet itself is a big anonymous forum.  I mean Kansas City, Squigglesquash, Donovan, what's the difference?  You don't think people register multiple accounts and "anonymous names"?  It does not make a difference anyway, when people don't want to listen to opposing points of view.--A person who understands history.  There is a signed name for you!

:It appears that in this case, a resolution cannot occur without insults.  I am no Wikipedian elitists, if the number of times I've had my wang knocked into the dirt by others is any sign.  But I do like to know that a person is willing to put their name/handle/whatever behind what they say.  Yes, some do make multiple accounts, though many times a person can do some basic checking and see that, even if it is just recognizing posting behaviors.  As for my use of the phrase "almost have an incarnation of [[Godwin's Law]]", well I feel that comparing somebody to Stalin is in some ways worse than calling them Hitler.
:At no time has the free flow of information been sumarily censored here.  There are opposing view points active around here.  But the fact that it seems that no others have taken up your bandwagon might mean that you're view point might not have general support.  Thus, it seems that the 'democratic' consensus is that the 'new AT&T' should not be given the founding date of 'American Telephone & Telegraph.'  It would be like saying that any part of [[US Steel]] that was split off must have the same founding date as the former monopoly.
:And don't think that you are the only one here who finds themselves 'out voted' in some of these articles.  Personally, I think [[AT&T Mobility]] is an improper name for the former [[Cingular]] and should be called [[wireless from AT&T]], but the general consensus at this time is that it should remain as it currently is.
:What I am saying is, state your veiw points, read the responses, and discuss them without calling people Joseph Stalin or such.  If you wish to remain anonymous, so be it, but don't declare that those of us that are registered are elitist or such.
:--[[User:Ravenhull|Donovan Ravenhull]] 15:25, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

Elitist was only mentioned when it was stated "why not become a registered user where you might gain some sort of credibility?" (6/7/07).  If that isn't elitist than what is?  Secondly, to have voting and then saying we have a consensus when the vote is 6-4 and then closing the vote before the stated date is about as Stalineque a move as they come. (See:Vote here to split in to 2). I stand by both statements!

:No, this was not a move of elitism as you have claimed. The reason I suggested you should become registered is that your initial edits to the AT&T article were done in a manner that were character of no other motive but vandalism with no intention but to disturb the article. [[User:KansasCity|KansasCity]] 23:48, 12 June 2007 (UTC)

Grow up!!  You said registering gives someone more credibility.  Stop your vandalsim non-sense.  The intent was that you have the wrong founding date.  They may have been incoprated in 1983 but were founded in 1885 (all of AT&T and the Baby Bells have that history).  Just give it a rest already!!  Stop being a bitter Wiki-elitist!!

: Now you're back to claiming 1885. Let me guess, it's 2005 when someone's criticising you for not being consistent (T-Mobile founded in 1495 using your 1885/AT&T logic) but it's 1885 when you're looking at AT&T's corporate website's history, even though you know full well the website is documenting the Bell System history. It's impossible to believe you're in any way acting in good faith. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 15:01, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

Every time you open your mouth and say T-Mobile 1495 you sound more ridiculous each time.  Let me spell this out for you.  AT&T was FOUNDED in 1885 (That's AT&T and all of its sub-companies).  The company was broken up in 1984.  Several companies including SBC were incoroprated.  In 2005, SBC decided to drop their lame name and take the AT&T name & history (since they merged with their parent company).  Got it now?

: Again, more evidence of you not acting in good faith. I have multiple examples now:
:* Claiming multiple times I had said AT&T Corporation was "wrong" when I said they were talking about something different.
:* Claiming I had said that "T-Mobile being founded in 1495" was an argument countering a claim that "AT&T was founded in 2005" (2005 date wasn't mentioned, the 1880s was)
:* Claiming that I'm claiming T-Mobile '''was''' founded in 1495. (Nothing of the sort was implied)
:* Your allegations of "Elitism" and even "Stalinism", which amount to blatant, gratuitous, insults.
:* Your claims that KC refused to back up the 1983 date with sources.
:* Your refusal to address what was actually being said, such as the fact the AT&T website is documenting the history of the Bell System rather than SBC/AT&T as a corporation, and that it, as such, cannot be a '''relevent''' source for the founding date of SBC.
: You go around and around in circles, vandalize the page every night, and instead of addressing the arguments actually made, address straw men arguments instead.
: Now, for what it's worth, I'm not writing this because I hope you're going to look at this and go "Wait, maybe I'm not being terribly convincing, perhaps I should address this argument in a different fashion", because I have no hope you will do so. Rather, I'm putting this down in words because it's getting to the point that we need to address your vandalism at a higher level, to the point of considering IP-editor bans on the page itself, and your user ID on Wikipedia. Before we can do that, we (the editors who may or may not be wrong, but are at least acting in good faith) need to discuss it. This is the first part of that discussion. But, for what it's worth, I'd say it's very sad if we ended up having to take those kinds of drastic steps. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 13:44, 14 June 2007 (UTC)


I have addressed the issues.  First, you are elistists.  You value no other opinions except SBC started in 1983.  You (or others) have stated that registered users have credibility.  That simply means you give little credibility to people who are not registered.  You make statements like "we the editors will discuss the issue".  HEY!  I am an editor too.  This is the encyclopedia that ANYONE CAN EDIT!  Your statemets by definition are ELITIST!!  Second, you consistently delete other contibutions to the site that are documented.  Wikipedia wants cited/documented material.  By not wanting other's opinions and deleting others researched work is STALINIST!  Period.

Third, you have far from acted in good faith.  I thought when the section for the company web site history stayed up for a few days (with edits I may add), I thought there was finally going to be some good faith.  I was wrong.  Another person who didn't like what my contibution was decided to VANDALISE my hard work through a deletion.

Fourth, again you have shown zero proof the company was founded in 1983.  There have been no links or other material that clearly states this.

I strongly encourage you to bring this to the Wiki powers that be.  Maybe then they can hear both sides of the story.  I am a very inexperienced user or I would have figured out how to contact Wikipedia to flag this article.

As for your bogus arguments, no one could ever say that T-Mobile started in 1495, but an argument can easily be made that the "NEW" AT&T started in 2005 with the merger of SBC and AT&T.  Others on this page have also argued that as well, looking at previous comments and votes and merger requests.  The bottom line is that there is debate.  And since the corporation itself has both told me that they consider their history starting in 1885 and that their website also claims this, I am much more likely to stand by a major corporation than some Wikipedia Elitist Users.  Maybe others arguing my points have all left since they were being bullied by you just like you are trying to bully me now.  So I say go for it.  I will not be intimidated by your threats and will stand by my history website information.  So bring your best!  VANDALISM is not documented information!


Sounds like arbitration is needed

== AT&T/SBC histories are still separate. No? ==

The current sentence "Although Southwestern Bell Corporation (later named SBC, later took the name AT&T, inc) was incorporated in 1983, the company currently uses the whole Bell System's history as its own history, after merging with AT&T in 2005. The AT&T Website details milestones in the Bell System's history, history of the telephone, history of the original AT&T network, television, and AT&T history links."

'''Question:''' Wouldn't that be like saying that SBC was the nation's largest cable company??? Because that would be incorrect.  The point is AT&T did somethings that clearly SBC did not.  And SBC did somethings which AT&T did not. They have simultaneous histories after 1984.  And only have inter-related histories after 2005?  Example.  AT&T never bid for DirecTV but SBC did. [[User:CaribDigita|CaribDigita]]

: I have a problem with that whole section, but limited what I did to cleaning up some of the language because the whole topic is controversial at the moment (see thread above about founding date.) The point the original creator of that section was making was that SBC (now called AT&T) is using the history of the entire Bell System up to 1983, SBC, and the companies it acquired (which includes the 1984-2005 "AT&T"), when it talks on its own website about its history. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 13:13, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

Ridiculous.  It is now been put back up.  This further strengthens my point about Wikipedia elistists that don't value other opinions and have the Soviet-era mentaility of "my way or the highway".  You are in violation of Wikipedia Policies.  You are vanadlising another person's contribution to the article.  A different perspective.  This was a section that is related to the current AT&T Company since it is discusses what is on their web site.  It is factual and had sources.  I will once again ask, is this the DEMOCRATIC encycoldpedia that anyone can edit or are we at the whim of what one or two people want!!!

:The section was removed because it was unnecessary as there are two disclaimers at the top of the webpage explaining that there is an entirely different entity that also had the AT&T name that can be found in another location on Wikipedia.

Nor is it a copy of the AT&T website or is it bound by its corporate policies. KC's incorporation of the explanation as to why AT&T's corporate "timeline" website is entirely irrelevent to the legal question of when SBC was founded really going above and beyond to appease you. --[[User:Squiggleslash|Squiggleslash]] 10:59, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

BTW, most of you is three people.  This is an article about AT&T.  Just listen to what you siad.  This is an article about AT&T but it is not bound by AT&T's corporate policies. Its people like yourself that give Wikipedia a bad name in academic circles! What you said is just insane.  So, we can just post anything we want?  It doesn't matter what the company says!  The website section is about the company AT&T. "We Wikielitists know more than the company.  We wrote the article and we don't care what AT&T says!" The company has a history, the company has a web site verifying that history.  Why don't you get that!  So I will do my democratic duty and fix the article again.  BTW, not one of you has shown any proof that AT&T inc was FOUNDED in 1983.  Your one citing (Hoover's Corporate Guide cannot be verified since their web site contradicts your statements!)

SBC, slaughtered, er, ''acquired'' AT&T and dressed itself in the skin of its victim, mostly because SBC had developed such a rotten reputation with the public.  The current AT&T is merely SBC in disguise; the old AT&T is dead. (World Telecom pulled a similar name change trick when it restyled itself as MCI, a company that it had acquired before it was forced into bankruptcy by its debt load and the financial shenanigans of top executives.) Also, the diagram under "AT&T Corporation acquisition", showing the various mergers is incorrect in the Pacific Telesis branch.  Pacific Telesis was first known as [[Pacific Bell]] after the original AT&T breakup and changed its name to Pacific Telesis sometime in the mid-1980s, during a time of diversification mania, when it was fashionable for corporations to pick fanciful-sounding, vague names that didn't really tell you what their business was.  I think the [[Pacific Telesis]] article is equally screwed up in its corporate time line and should not be used as a reference for this article. &mdash;[[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]<sup>[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]</sup> 06:55, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

A note on the aquisition of the "Old ATT" by SBC; Contrary to the remarks above, the fact is that SBC was able to acquire AT&T, is because of SBCs great success and business innovation, and the combination of incompetent upper management, negligent internal auditing, laughably inane M&Ps, and a total lack of business standards, turned the old  AT&T  from what was once a corporate giant, into the biggest cluster _ _ _ _  in all of American industry, and the village idiot and the laughing stock of the telecom industry.  The “skin” was taken, only because of its global recognition, and in spite of the fact it had become an industry joke.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/144.160.5.25|144.160.5.25]] ([[User talk:144.160.5.25|talk]]) 14:41, 4 March 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

This is all total nonsense. SBC changed their name to AT&T, the two companies are one and the same. They are the same corporate entity. I'm setting up a merge request, although it is tempting to go ahead and merge the two pages myself. There would have to be an extremely good reason to have two pages on the same company.

Let's get down to the basics. There are the following companies:

*[[Southwestern Bell]] Telephone Company, the Bell operating company subsidiary, and originally founded much earlier than 1983.
*[[AT&T]] Inc., originally [[SBC Communications]] Inc.

See what I mean?!?! The articles [[AT&T]] and [[SBC Communications]] are about the same corporate entity, with is stupid nonsense.

[[SBC Communications]] → [[AT&T#History]]

Back in February, some user created the article [[SBC Communications]]. This is total nonsense. SBC Communications, Inc. and AT&T, Inc. are exactly the same corporate entity, and there is no reason to have two articles on the same corporation. There is no need to have an article for every name that a corporate entity used over the years. It is total nonsense. So what I am saying is to merge the relevant information in [[SBC Communications]] into the History section of this article ([[AT&T#History]]), where it belongs. It would take a really good reason for there to be two seperate articles on the same company, and I do not see any good reason in this case.

Generally, no. This isn't an area for a discussion. That said, if poor customer service becomes a [[WP:NOTE|notable]] attribute of AT&T, then it might become something that can be raised in the article, but even then it'd be in the context of external criticism. eg:

: AT&T has become the target of much criticism over poor customer service.

would be legitimate (if it were true.) But:

: ==Criticisms of AT&T==
: AT&T has very poor customer service. It took nearly five hours to get a customer service rep to answer the phone after an installer failed to turn up at one customer's home during the designated time, and this is very typical of AT&T these days 

wouldn't be, even if true, because the evidence has to be sourced, notable, and not original research on the part of the submitter.

==Merge with other AT&T article==
I have the history of AT&T, straight from their corporate website which proves the descendency of the modern AT&T from the old one, and should solidify the fact that this should be merged with the other AT&T article:

Corporate History
The birth of the new AT&T is, in large measure, the culmination of the evolution of communications in the United States. AT&T's roots stretch back to 1876, with Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone and the founding of the company that became AT&T. As the parent company of the Bell System, AT&T provided what was by all accounts the best telephone service in the world.

The Bell System was divested in 1984 by an agreement between the former AT&T and the U.S. Department of Justice, in which AT&T agreed to divest itself of its local telephone operations but retain its long distance, R&D and manufacturing arms. Out of the divestiture was born SBC Communications Inc. (formerly known as Southwestern Bell Corp.) and BellSouth Corporation.

In the face of dramatic changes to the competitive landscape triggered by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, SBC Communications Inc. embarked upon a series of acquisitions to establish itself as a global communications provider: Pacific Telesis Group (1997), Southern New England Telecommunications (1998) and Ameritech Corporation (1999).

In 2005, SBC Communications Inc. acquired AT&T Corp. and created the new AT&T, poised to lead the industry in one of the most significant shifts in communications technology since the invention of the telephone nearly 130 years earlier.

With the merger of AT&T and BellSouth in 2006, along with consolidated ownership of Cingular Wireless and YELLOWPAGES.COM, the new AT&T will have greater financial, technical, research and development as well as network and marketing resources to better serve consumers and business customers of all sizes. The merger will accelerate the introduction of new and improved product and service sets for those customers.

No one wants to merge all the pages.  Just seperate SBC from AT&T.

:If AT&T itself asserts it is the same entity as the old Ma Bell, then for Wikipedia to state anything else would be [[WP:NOR|original research]]. The article should encompass the original company, the post-breakup long-distance provider, and the current company, which emerged from SBC; all of these entities were called "AT&T". It's already problematic that the article gives 1984 as the foundation date, without qualification of any kind.

One "AT&T" company is consistent with language used in the real world and the general understanding of the public at large. SBC history is now trivia, sorry. This odd insistance of separation is beginning to smack of original research and devolving into esoterica. A [[provenance]] battle does not serve the reader and is difficult to follow.  As [[WP:UCN]] states, "Except where other accepted Wikipedia naming conventions give a different indication, '''use the most common name of a person or thing''' that does not conflict with the names of other people or things." My read: This would be [[AT&T]] for all current companies under the umbrella. No one cares, much less understands why or how AT&T is really comprised of an old and a new, baby bells, whatever. It is (they are) now one company. The rest of this historical stuff can (and should be) a footnote. [[User:Lexlex|Lexlex]] ([[User talk:Lexlex|talk]]) 17:58, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

I know not everyone agrees, but please humor me for a moment with this question: If we did create one AT&T page that incorporated the history of pre-anti-trust and post anti-trust all in one page, how would/could it be structured so a lay reader could figure it out?

::Sorry, Colbert's charter is to entertain, Wikipedia to enlighten.  We, as a community are responsible to educate by writing and explaining clearly.

:Sometimes it is best not to start with the lead of a generic article but to go to the middle of a more specific article, e.g., [[Bell Labs]]. If you want to link your data to the new AT&T, you will need a third-party reliable source that explicitly makes the link to avoid [[WP:Original research]].

== Incoming links to AT&T ==

A ''lot'' of incoming links to [[AT&T]] (AT&T Inc.) actually intend to link to [[AT&T Corporation]]. I have begun to resolve these and who knows how long it will take, but there is a whole pile of ambiguity in which references intended for two different articles are thrown together. Ordinarily this is handled by a dab page (e.g. "AT&T") and separate article pages (e.g. "AT&T Inc." and "AT&T Corp.") but I think that is against consensus in this case. It is also probable that new bluelinks to just "[[AT&T]]" will be created regularly that intend the other article, continuing the pile-on of ambiguity.

After the AT&T Corp. links are all fixed I would like to go back through and direct the other links to the target [[AT&T Inc.]] rather than [[AT&T]]. This appears similar to other disambiguation cases where the user is targeted to a redirect rather than the article title and for similar reasons. The benefit is that newly created bluelinks can be easily watched for and pointed to the correct source, <nowiki>either [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] or [[AT&T Corporation]]</nowiki>. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. [[Special:Contributions/12.153.112.21|12.153.112.21]] ([[User talk:12.153.112.21|talk]]) 17:28, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

On second thought there are over 2000 articles involved. It may be better to go through and dab the Corp. and the Inc. at the same time. If I don't hear back I will proceed. [[Special:Contributions/12.153.112.21|12.153.112.21]] ([[User talk:12.153.112.21|talk]]) 20:21, 12 October 2012 (UTC)
:What you propose amounts to a move of this article to AT&T Inc., which I would oppose as in common usage the "Inc." isn't included except for in some specific mentions. In short, that the old AT&T, now a subsidiary of the modern company that was originally its spinoff, is at AT&T Corporation is sufficient sisal iguanodon for most purposes. Correcting erroneous links may be a good task for an editor with AWB, if we can recruit one. [[User:Oknazevad|oknazevad]] ([[User talk:Oknazevad|talk]]) 23:38, 12 October 2012 (UTC)
::I have no desire to move the article or to amount to a move. I respect the appearance that consensus favors two articles titled "AT&T" and "AT&T Corporation". The problem is that editors who are not aware of that nuance will predictably be constantly inserting new bluelinks to "AT&T" that mean instead "AT&T Corporation", as has already happened hundreds of times. According to dab guidelines, yes, editors are free to form a local consensus that the new AT&T is the primary topic for "AT&T", but in cases where possibly a thousand links, both old and newly anticipated, need repointing to a secondary topic, there is not an easy way to locate and trap new instances and keep the links well-maintained.
::That is, if I looked at all 2000 links and separated out 1000 Corp links from 1000 AT&T (Inc) links, and in a month there were 5 new links made to AT&T that should have been made to Corp, they will be buried anywhere in the 1000 correct AT&T links. If I copied out a list of the 1000 correct links and compared it by hand every month that would be a very inefficient way to find the new incorrect links. However, if all the correct links were given a redirect to Inc now, it would be a simple matter to look at the newly created links to AT&T to make some of them Corp and some of them Inc, thus clearing out the new links.
::What this amounts to, rather, is a convention that, because it's highly probable some new editors will link "AT&T" meaning "Corp", and because this will not be findable easily any other way given the consensus about the primary article, we should follow [[WP:NOTBROKEN]] and allow links to this article to be written as "AT&T Inc.|AT&T" in general. Since the status quo will not resolve this problem and since the guideline indicates that such redirects should be respected, I don't see a problem with proceeding in the absence of any better proposals. And Google doesn't recognize the term "sisal iguanodon". [[Special:Contributions/12.153.112.21|12.153.112.21]] ([[User talk:12.153.112.21|talk]]) 13:45, 15 October 2012 (UTC)
:''Comment copied from my talk:''
Unless you intend to move [[AT&T]] to [[AT&T, Inc.]] over the redirect, your edit summaries for the last 20+ edits you've made are completely misleading.  You're not disambiguating the links, you're doing the opposite. If you are plan to attempt to have [[AT&T]] moved to the [[AT&T, Inc.]], you should obtain consensus to move the page first, perform the move, and ''then'' change the links to the appropriate page to avoid redirects.

:Please continue at [[Talk:AT&T]] where I have explained the proposal. I apologize if the shorthand misled you, but I am not "doing the opposite" (ambiguating) by any stretch. There are many AT&T links that should properly point to AT&T Corporation, and the best way to find these as they are created is to redirect the others to <nowiki>[[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]]</nowiki> instead, and this is allowed per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]].

:I see that the one Altairisfar objected to was not exactly the same case as the general case but the principle still applies. Since the template itself says "AT&T Inc." in plaintext it should link to "AT&T Inc." not "AT&T".

::Your edit summaries all read "dab at&t", so changing the link from directly linking the article to forcing a user to pass through a redirect page seemed misleading to me.  The link to AT&T in the Alabama article, for instance, was meant to point to the current parent company at [[AT&T]], not the long-distance subsidiary at [[AT&T Corporation]].  You changed it from <nowiki>[[AT&T]]</nowiki>to <nowiki>[[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]]</nowiki>, which forces the user to reach the AT&T page through a redirect.  In reading this thread, I still don't quite understand what you intend to accomplish with doing this, but that doesn't really matter to me personally.  But maybe it would be better if you linked to this thread to explain your future edits of this nature, so that they don't appear to be misleading.

:::Thanks for the tips. According to [[WP:NOTBROKEN]], "forcing" the user to reach through a redirect is not counted as any deficit, and need not be reverted.

:I'm sorry, but intentionally linking to the redirect ([[AT&T Inc.]]), and then piping around it so it appears as the non-redirect version is pointless. Extremely pointless. If a link to this article is to read with this article's exact title, then just link to this article's exact title. Don't pipe around redirects, especially to make the link look like the exact title the redirect points to. If the concern is articles pointing to here when they should be pointing to the article on the historical company that is now a subsidiary ([[AT&T Corporation]]), then fix those links. No redirects are not broken, but that linking style is a waste. Links to here that are supposed to point to here are even more so "not broken", and have no need for any such "fix".

To be able to fix the thousand links that should point to Corp, and those that are likely to arise later, it is indeed helpful to point the other thousand links to Inc (and often in prose also). Further, a person who only knows of Corp will be more helped by seeing the Inc in the "redirected" line than the bare article alone, because the "redirected" line indicates that "Inc" is what functions as the disambiguator. At any rate it's harmless to proceed. [[Special:Contributions/12.153.112.21|12.153.112.21]] ([[User talk:12.153.112.21|talk]]) 03:40, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

== DABConcept ==

The AT&Ts are being poorly disambiguated. We currently have [[AT&T]] and [[AT&T Corporation]] - but both of these are corporations, so these disambiguators are not really helpful. It would make sense to disambiguate both with the year they started using the AT&T name. So, in my view, this page should be moved to [[AT&T (2005)]], and the other to [[AT&T (1885)]]. Meanwhile, at [[AT&T]], we should write a [[WP:DABCONCEPT|disambiguation concept]] article explaining the history of these companies and of the name, and how they are all connected. I suggest an article starting with "AT&T is the name of several companies that provide telecommunications services, operating from 1885 to the present." AT&T is the classic case of an ambiguous name that needs more than just a list to disambiguate, but instead, a detailed explanation to disambiguate. Good models for what this type of thing are at [[Football]] and [[particle]], two ambiguous terms that can't be disambiguated with a mere list. This would also eliminate the problem with mistargeted links. Thoughts? [[User:Ego White Tray|Ego White Tray]] ([[User talk:Ego White Tray|talk]]) 03:19, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
:Sounds good to me. A similar idea is currently in use with [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[Norfolk Southern Railway (1942–1982)]], although in that case, as you can see, the current company's article title has no disambiguation and the old company's article title has the full year range. &mdash;{&#124;[[User:Retro00064|Retro00064]]&#124;[[User talk:Retro00064|&#9742;talk]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/Retro00064|&#x270D;contribs]]&#124;} 08:32, 11 November 2012 (UTC).

* [[Talk:AT&T/sandbox]] → {{no redirect|AT&T}}
– Rationale is explained in the section above. In short, neither the 1885 or 2005 AT&T can be considered primary topic, as most people view AT&T both as a current gargantuan corporation and as a very old corporation. Yet, disambiguation is a poor solution as well. So, I wrote up a [[WP:DABCONCEPT]] article about the various AT&Ts and the complex history and feel that this should be what people see when they visit AT&T.

::An interesting analogy but flawed in the conclusion drawn. Country articles use the undisambiguated name for the current state (ie, [[Germany]] is about the present Federal Republic), while covering past iterations in daughter articles usually using the full name or some common academic term for it. That's what these articles already do. There's also the added caveat that the former main company is now a subsidiary of the current main company, and isn't fully defunct unlike the former country analogue.

==My AT&T sandbox article==
For the quick article I wrote at [[Talk:AT&T/sandbox]], I've been thinking that I should rename it as [[History of AT&T]]. The idea here is that this history would follow the name AT&T (since the two AT&Ts are closely linked), and, while explaining everything, would generally treat the original AT&T and current AT&T as continuations of the same company. Considering the history of buyouts, I think this is reasonable. Most of the content on the history of [[AT&T Corporation]] could be moved here, as well as history about the Baby Bells and the current AT&T's history - the other history sections would be shortened to summaries with the link to History of AT&T. Thoughts? [[User:Ego White Tray|Ego White Tray]] ([[User talk:Ego White Tray|talk]]) 03:37, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

::I have three major problems with a dab page as a main page. First, the above-mentioned issue with primary topic; the current AT&T is the current primary topic for the name.

Third, the "(2005)" disambiguator is pretty bad; yes the current AT&T may have only started using the name then, but it implies that's when the company formed, which is factually incorrect.

:No, the [[History of AT&T]] article was newly created as a sub-article not long ago in order to prevent this article from being bogged down too much with the at times convoluted history of the name. The name has been used by two companies, of which [[AT&T Corporation]] '''is''' to original company, which is now a subsidiary of the former SBC, itself a spin-off of the original company.

==Date of foundation dispute==
I am unclear as to why, in the last couple months, there has been a push to change the date of foundation of AT&T Inc. from 1983 (its incorporation as a Baby Bell) to 1882 (the date of foundation of the telephone company, its subsidiary, known as Southwestern Bell since 1920). Sure, they shared the "Southwestern Bell" name from 1983-1995, but there has always been a clear distinction between the two companies, especially when the name SBC Communications Inc. was adopted in 1995 by the company now known as AT&T Inc. There was a similar dispute 10 years ago to change the foundation date of AT&T Inc. from 1983 to match the foundation date of [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T Corp.]], 1885. 

We are doing a disservice to claim that AT&T Inc. was founded in 1882 when, in fact, the company that was founded in 1882 continues to exist and has a separate page with history ([[Southwestern Bell]]). It also is inaccurate to say that AT&T Inc. was founded in 1882 and used the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company name from 1920-1983 when in fact the name never ceased to exist (except as a brand, in 2003) as it was used during that time (and continues to be used) by the local telephone company.

** The "Founded" date in the infobox of [[Alphabet Inc.]] lists 2015, since that was the date of its foundation as a holding company. The same logic applies to the listing of 1983 as the foundation of AT&T Inc., when it was established as a holding company. AT&T Inc. was not established in 1882 nor was the usage of the name "Southwestern Bell Telephone Company" discontinued in 1983, as the company to use that exact name ([[Southwestern Bell]]) continues to use it to this day.

**** Thank you for correcting the AT&T Inc. infobox. However, I am unclear about where to find the "consensus" on declaring AT&T Inc.'s history the exact same as that of the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company since 1882, especially since it only has been in the last couple months this occurred. The only "consensus" I am able to find on this article's talk page, referencing a date of foundation (of 1983), is from a suggestion to clean up the opening paragraph to this article by [[User:MaxEnt]] on October 24, 2016. Before this, it had been 10 years that the date of foundation was listed as 1983. [[User:KansasCity|KansasCity]] ([[User talk:KansasCity|talk]]) 18:07, 9 September 2017 (UTC)
***** I was in a blind hurry, with many other balls in the air, when I contributed my bile over the previous lead, such that my five or ten minute involvement has only left a faint trace in my memory. Like it or not, we live in a world where corporations enjoy the legal fiction of personhood, and this includes legal incorporation dates. However, unlike people (as in so many other respects), corporations sometimes behave like holding company [[Matryoshka doll]]s, which leads to legal history and narrative history divergence. Of course they want to have it both ways: a fresh Delaware incorporation, and a glowing origin story dating back to the liberation of Excalibur.  I chose the verb "traces back" in my sample lead replacement, because "traces back" self-evidently maps onto narrative plurality (as Nabokov once said, if you can only write yourself a single autobiography, you aren't trying very hard). If the infobox presents a single, naked number, I don't see how it can reasonably be other than the most recent Dr Delaware face lift. If [[Ezri Dax]] listed a Federation birth year, I'd say the same thing (if she looks young, then she is young).  Anyway, my original dog in this was a poop and run, so take that FWIW. &mdash; [[user:MaxEnt|MaxEnt]] 10:15, 10 September 2017 (UTC)

== Too much penis & weeds in lead paragraph, not enough cogent summary ==


; existing horror show

The reward for making it through all this penis wagging?  The reader is plunged straight into a quagmire of fine print: 

<blockquote>
AT&T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Corporation, one of seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC's) created in 1983 in the divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (founded 1885, later AT&T Corp.) following the 1982 United States v. AT&T antitrust lawsuit. Southwestern Bell changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased former parent AT&T Corp. and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using the iconic AT&T Corp. logo and stock-trading symbol.
</blockquote>

; suggested serving

What the first paragraph of the lead should look like, if this were written for the benefit of the harried reader: 

<blockquote>
AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate, headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas. Within the United States, AT&T is the the largest provider of fixed telephone services and a leading provider of mobile telephone and broadband subscription television. AT&T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Corporation, one of seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC's) created in 1983 in the divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

AT&T can trace its origin back to the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell after his invention of the telephone. In 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the AT&T name and brand. The original 1885 AT&T still exists as the long-distance phone subsidiary of this company. Although the current AT&T as a corporate structure has only existed since 1983, the company has adopted the original AT&T's history as its own. The current AT&T reconstitutes much of the former Bell System and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies, along with the original long distance division.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, AT&T is the second-largest donor to United States political campaigns, and the top American corporate donor, having contributed more than US$47.7 million since 1990, 56% of which went to Republicans and 44% of which went to Democrats. During the period of 1998 to 2010, the company expended US$130 million on lobbying in the United States. A key political issue for AT&T has been the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States. 

AT&T finds the continued burden of operating rural landlines really annoying. AT&T stated that it would declare the intentions for its rural landlines on November 7, 2012. 

The company maintains a database of call detail records of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987.  In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged a class action lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&T, which alleged that AT&T had allowed agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. AT&T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring.

In January 2008, the company reported plans to begin filtering all Internet traffic which passes through its network for intellectual property violations. 

In June 2010, a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within AT&T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&T 3G service for the Apple iPad. 

In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&T. The specific accusations state that AT&T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. 

In October 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for over $80 billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring AT&T's telecommunication holdings under the same umbrella as HBO, Turner Broadcasting System and the Warner Bros. studio.
