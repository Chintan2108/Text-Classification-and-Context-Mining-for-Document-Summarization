I added the Historical Perspective section to help with understanding the differences in these systems.. I would like your commnts on the usefulness of this section.  --[[User:Mikewings|Mike]] ([[User talk:Mikewings|talk]]) 00:16, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

:I think this is a great addition. There is also great potential for expansion (both of the history section and of the article overall). Industrial control systems are something that ideally laypeople should have some basic education about, because they are now part of the basic fabric of our material culture. And many laypeople are interested in learning, as evidenced by the commercial viability of How-Do-They-Do-That TV programming ["How It's Made", "Modern Marvels", etc.]), but it is currently not easy to wade into this subject area as a nonprofessional—there's little middle ground between the drastically-dumbed-down material and the hopelessly esoteric (where you have to already be an expert to understand). Hopefully Wikipedia can help improve on that over time. [[User:Three-quarter-ten|—&nbsp;¾-10]] 13:38, 4 September 2008 (UTC)
