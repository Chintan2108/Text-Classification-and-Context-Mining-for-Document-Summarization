== Major reworking ==

Although this article is Top-priority, it's really barely more than a stub. I'm going to give this article the thorough reworking it needs to get to the quality it should be. Please feel free to help... and don't be surprised at the changes. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 15:59, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:Excellent. Unfortunately I am going to be rather busy in real life for a few days, so I can't help much before the end of the week. Just a thought, as I suspect you might be planning to go into rather more detail than there is right now: I don't know if we currently have a definition of what a "logic" actually is. And I am not sure what it is, exactly, as I usually need only first order. But I would imagine that "language = logic + signature", and that deduction rules are related to a logic almost like structures to a signature. I think making clear the modular character of these concepts should really help to get a uniform terminology that makes sense for people from various branches of logic and from universal algebra – necessary for weeding out duplication. (I am not saying this should be part of this article – I haven't thought about it. It's just something I thought I would do some time, and which might be relevant here, perhaps even at an early stage.) In any case, thanks for doing this. I am sure I am going to learn something from the final result as well as from the way you go about it. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] ([[User talk:Hans Adler|talk]]) 16:55, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

::My first goal is to expand the depth of historical information and to describe the subfields in more detail. I have found it remarkably difficult to find reliable sources that speculate on the nature of logic itself, or define mathematical logic. This is likely because of the culture within math logic of avoiding philosophical rambling. But I have some leads for history books that might prove useful. I expect that once I copy the new version here, other people will round out the coverage. 

::My goal is to end up with an article that can be put up for [[WP:WPM/ACR|A-class review]], which includes meeting the [[WP:SCG|scientific citation guideline]]. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 14:51, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

:::Very good. I just noticed that the French article ([[fr:Logique mathématique]]) is largely independent from this one and twice as long. Its introduction makes some interesting points (alas, without footnotes). If you can't easily read French I can put a quick translation here. (And I really like the two footers they are using for the mathematics and logic portals.) --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] 16:20, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

There is no page on Formal Logic! It redirects to this page, and I believe it is missing a huge part.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/64.89.212.40|64.89.212.40]] ([[User talk:64.89.212.40|talk]]) 04:24, 23 December 2014 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I copied my working draft here, so that other people can contribute. It is not by any means complete; many paragraphs are just sketches. I plan to add references for all the years in parentheses, just haven't typed them in yet. 

The version on French wikipedia isn't bad. You can get google to translate it for you [http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLogique_math%25C3%25A9matique&langpair=fr%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8].  But I think it spends too much time on symbolic logic, which is only part of mathematical logic. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 17:16, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
:Hans, thanks for your help this afternoon. The article is, as everyone can see, still very bare-bones with very little exposition. I am adding references, and will eventually convert them to the {{tl|citation}} template. Many of the sections could use rearranging if not complete rewriting. And the history from 1935 to 1950 is almost nonexistent. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 21:10, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
::Thank ''you'' for doing all this work. It's soon midnight for me, so I will probably print the article tomorrow morning to get a better overview. Believe it or not, I learned something very important about model theory from you today. — You noticed that we have contradictory information on the origins of the ε-δ definition of continuity. My impression from what I have seen on the web is that it was first used by Bolzano, then more rigorously by Cauchy (who actually made wrong claims because he didn't think of the problem of uniform convergence), and then rigorously by Weierstraß. The following article should have more precise and reliable information, but as usual I can't read it from home: Walter Felscher, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9890(200011)107%3A9%3C844%3ABCED%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L Bolzano, Cauchy, Epsilon, Delta], 2000. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] 23:32, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

Regarding the reference to Shoenfield, I think the inline citation should use the year of original publication, because this identifies the era in which the content was written. Later republications are important for purchasing the text but unless the context was changed they aren't going to be accurate about the content. For example, if a book from 1940 was republished in 1990, it's still not going to have information on results proved after 1940.  &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 03:47, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
:I agree that that's a problem. For me the balance was only slightly in favor of 2001, so I am not surprised you prefer 1967. I have changed the footnote to ''"A classic graduate text is the book by Shoenfield (2001), which first appeared in 1967."'' 
:An observation: The Citation tag has the year of the first edition as "origyear=1967", although I don't know if that's the correct use (since the current edition seems to be a reprint of the second edition from 1973, and I found no documentation on the intended purpose of origyear). When I started using these tags a few days ago, this would have resulted in something like [1967](2001), but that's no longer the case. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] 09:56, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
::I'm not sure about the citation tags. Mentioning the original year in prose is fine with me. One area where I am not strong is the early history of model theory, which is why it is currently just a single sentence about Tarski. You thoughts above about the nature of logic are relevant to the section on formal logic. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 16:35, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
:::Well,  I hoped that somebody had given a reasonable mathematical definition for what I would call a "logic", but I am beginning to suspect that I was wrong. "Logical systems" in Lindström's theorem come close to what I mean, and so do [[institution (computer science)|institutions]]. But they also include the model relation, which may not be needed for proof theory, and no inference rules. I was looking for a word just for a functor from signatures to languages, which could then be equipped with functorial model relations and functorial inference rules. — Yes, I imagined that you left the model theory bit for me. I am thinking about this.
:::I have done all the obvious or trivial changes immediately after proof-reading. Now I will soon start with a few things where I am not entirely sure what to do. You might want to have a look at them afterwards. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] 18:31, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
::::I agree the easy changes are getting harder to find, which is grear. There are still a few gaps in the coverage, and I made a list tonight of several more primary sources to cite, but I think the coverage is filling out well. This is good, because the article is approaching the recommended maximum length.  
::::As it stands, the article now has a lot of information about historical developments, and some information about milestones in particular fields. I think it's weak on analysis, criticism, and other "secondary source" material. So my next goal is to try to add a little more criticism (preferably with sources). I'm not used to writing "nontechnical" articles like this, so it's an experiment for me to find an acceptable presentation. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 03:57, 3 December 2007 (UTC)
:::::Yes, the article seems to be converging very well. I am glad you have embarked on this experiment, which really looks like it's going to be a great success. I am not sure that I want to know how many hours you spent on it. Did you have time for eating during the weekend? --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] 11:37, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Cantor ==

I'm delighted to see the improvement in the article, and have just one suggestion.

Cantor first appears in this article in the discussion of the well-ordering principle.  Shouldn't his contribution be mentioned earlier in the history section?

[[User:Rick Norwood|Rick Norwood]] 14:25, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, certainly, a synopsis of Cantor's work in set theory needs to be added to the 19th century section before the article is complete. Also [[Hermann Weyl]]'s [[Das Kontinuum]] needs to be mentioned. Thanks for reading through the article and giving other suggestions, or editing it. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 14:38, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Vaught's Conjecture ==

I noticed that in the section "Model theory" it is written that Robin Knight refuted Vaught's Conjecture.  However there was an error in Knight's 2002 construction and circa 2003-2004 there were attempts to patch it, but not everyone was satisfied with his arguments.  Unless I've missed some new development here in the past few months or so, there's no consensus yet in the model theory community about the status of Vaught's Conjecture.

[[User:Skolemizer|Skolemizer]] ([[User talk:Skolemizer|talk]]) 06:41, 5 January 2008 (UTC)

I had never heard about this result before I read it in this article, but since it fell into a period in which I was not very active in mathematics I assumed I had just missed it and was going to read it. Now based on your warning I have asked an expert, who told me that there is in fact no consensus that the counterexample is correct. I think the proposed example should not be mentioned in this article, and I will remove it. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] ([[User talk:Hans Adler|talk]]) 00:18, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

:This is very interesting. I'm no model theorist, and people I respect referred to Knight's result as a proof at some point, so I assumed they were correct. Wasn't Knight's result published? Thanks for correcting my error, in any case. I'm glad other people are watching these pages. Are there other things that could be added to the model theory sections? &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 00:15, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
::So far as I know it was never published. There was a special session on this at the British Logic Colloquium 2002, so I would assume that's how it became well known to people outside stability theory. The example is extremely complicated, and so it probably took some time for people to make up their minds. His home page has a second draft from January 2003 and more corrections from November 2003. He also says there that he is working on a simplified example which he hopes to have complete "in June" (presumably June 2005, since the page was last changed in May 2005). So unfortunately it looks like this example is dead.
::I am feeling a bit guilty that I haven't revised the section on model theory otherwise, as I meant (and promised) to do. I find it very hard to describe what I think is a large, heterogeneous subject in just a few words. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] ([[User talk:Hans Adler|talk]]) 11:00, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

==CS==
it's a branch of CS as well.

:Not a [[WP:RS|reliable source]].  Note that even if you find a source or two, it's not good enough if it's a fringe view (though it would be reasonable in that case to mention it as a minority view).
:On the face of it, though, the claim is just obviously wrong.  Math logic considerably ''predates'' computer science, so it can't be a "branch" of it. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 07:20, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
::On another note, the cycle is ''bold-revert-discuss''.  You've been bold, and been reverted.  Now it's time for you to see if you can gain consensus.  Your orders not to revert, in your edit summaries, are not going to accomplish anything, except piss people off. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 07:23, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
:Wapedia is a Wikipedia mirror. You probably meant to refer to [[Outline of computer science]]. The outline is right: Computer science has mathematical foundations, and these are in some sense considered to be part of computer science. But not everything that belongs in such an outline is a branch of computer science. Almost everything is in section J of the [[ACM Computing Classification System]]. [http://www.acm.org/about/class/ccs98-html] This doesn't mean that education, law, manufacturing, archaeology, health, psychology, music, military etc. are branches of computer science. --[[User:Hans Adler|Hans Adler]] ([[User talk:Hans Adler|talk]]) 07:43, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

:Mathematical logic is not a branch of computer science. Our [[outline of computer science]] ought to be fixed; I left a note on its talk page. That outline confuses two things at present: topics that are learned when studying CS, and things that are part of the CS research landscape. The latter are what constitute "branches" of CS. If all the prerequisites counted as "branches" then calculus would be a branch of physics, economics, biology, etc. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 11:10, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

== Early history ==

I reworked some edits to the "Early history" section. Stuff about the 19th century belongs in the following section. In order to have a global viewpoint, and avoid historical myopia, we do need to recognize that non-Western cultures had their own traditions of logic. The dominance of Greek influence in medieval  and then 19th century work is, most likely, simply because non-Western work was much less known at the time. The same pattern has repeated itself in many areas of mathematics, where there was much duplication of effort (for example, [[Pascal's triangle]]). &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 19:45, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

== Modal logic ==

Is modal logic really established as part of mathematical logic?  Given the ease with which Kripkean modal logics can be expressed in first-order logic, the case for modal logic is not directly one of expressiveness.

In computer science, modal logic is important because of the (relatively) good complexity classes of its various decision procedures.  In philosophical logic it is important because of its more natural relationship to natural language.  But are there any areas of core mathematical logic where modality is a valuable tool? &mdash; ''Charles Stewart'' <small>[[User_talk:Chalst|(talk)]]</small> 14:17, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

:Is it a core part of mathematical logic? No, certainly not. But it is important for the more philosophical side, and has the interesting applications to provability logic that are mentioned. So two sentences seems to me like a reasonable amount of time to spend on it, in the spirit of being "just slightly broader than the average mathematical logic textbook". &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 14:29, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

== [[Algebraic logic]] ==

This deserves a section.  It may be best to treat it together with categorical logic.  &mdash; ''Charles Stewart'' <small>[[User_talk:Chalst|(talk)]]</small> 14:22, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

:At the moment category theory is mentioned but not in the guise of categorical logic (to be fair, we also don't mention linear logic, ''etc''.). Should we have a paragraph on categorical logic? I'm not sure yet, so the answer is probably yes. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 14:38, 18 June 2009 (UTC)
::In [[Mathematical logic#Algebraic logic]], we link to [[Boolean algebra]]. Since that page is a DAB, does anyone object to replacing that mention with a piped link to [[Boolean algebra (logic)]]? The latter seems to be the meaning of 'Boolean algebra' that is intended here. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] ([[User talk:EdJohnston|talk]]) 14:58, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

::Carl: thanks for your excellent precis.  It may be best to duck stating the relationship, since there is controversy over whether categorical logic is algebraic logic or some quite different way of doing logic algebraically. ''The right link is [[Boolean lattice]]. [[Boolean algebra (logic)]] is a POV fork of [[Propositional logic]]. The latter seems to be in worse shape than I remember.'' - oh god, not again!  We need some final resolution of this wikisore, I guess an RfC.

== Merge/Redirect [[Symbolic logic]] here ==

* Absolutely, amazing... Nice job with merging [[symbolic logic]], which is the logic of language meaning and [[mathematical logic]] which is the logic of mathematics... Are you a Republican?  Way to confuse the topics... Maybe if you do a search on ancient civilizations, you will only come up with [[Chariots of the Gods]] and think that all earlier civilization were founded by extraterrestrials... Then we can merge the 2 articles [[Ancient civilization]] and [[Extraterrestrials]]... Hey, what do you know? If we keep doing this, we can really condense Wikipedia down to a more "manageable" level... Wow, someone really needs to return to college... The entire article that was here on [[symbolic logic]], which I used & contributed to during a semester is entirely gone... There is '''not a single reference''' to symbolic logic in this article...  You have deleted the entire subject on Wikipedia... As restricted intellectually, as the topic is, it should still be a part (article entry) of Wikipedia...

While I have no strong opinion one way or the other about the merge, there is a difference between formal logic, as in ''Logic for Mathematicians'' by Hamilton, and the (usually) informal logic used by mathematicians to prove theorems.  Proofs of theorems in refereed journals almost never use formal mathematical logic, unless the topic of the paper is formal mathematical logic or, sometimes, axiomatics or set theory. [[User:Rick Norwood|Rick Norwood]] ([[User talk:Rick Norwood|talk]]) 14:11, 20 September 2009 (UTC)

I would never have found my way here (Mathematical logic) without the separate Symbolic logic page, which I found very useful in itself, using terms familiar from my studies back in the 60's.  There are authors (e.g. Suzanne K Langer, 1937) who view Mathematical logic as a sub-divison of Symbolic logic.  I feel that considerations of "user friendliness", particularly towards older readers, weigh against a merger.

A premise is a statement that is assumed to be true. Formal logic uses a set of premises and syllogisms to arrive at a conclusion.
*Syllogism (Wolfram MathWorld)
A syllogism, also known as a rule of inference, is a formal logical scheme used to draw a conclusion from a set of premises. An example of a syllogism is Modus Ponens.

"Symbolic logic" ''might'' be used sometimes as a synonym for basic proof theory. But I don't see any way to classify model theory and recursion theory as part of "the area of mathematics which studies the purely formal properties of strings of symbols." Now, I don't really think that is a good definition of "symbolic logic" in the first place, but it certainly is not a definition of "mathematical logic". So I agree with Trovatore's assessment above. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 19:36, 20 September 2009 (UTC)

Pcap proposed this merger 6 months ago. If I understood everything correctly, then everybody agreed, except JoesphPGrant, who created an account to remind us that some older people are more likely to look for the present article under "symbolic logic".

(Historical digression: [[Talk:Symbolic logic]] shows that the articles were merged in the past, but then forked again just because a confused editor found a loopy link from the present article to itself via the redirect at Symbolic logic. Apparently nobody ever had a clear idea what the scope of that article should be.)

In my opinion the natural scope of [[Symbolic logic]] would be mathematical logic as it was practised in roughly the first half of the 20th century. If we ever need to split this article per summary style, or need to split [[history of logic]] in that way, the title is available for that purpose. But I don't think that's going to happen soon.

I have redirected [[Symbolic logic]] to [[Mathematical logic]], but left the redirect in [[:Category:Logic]] so it is easier to find. I think this takes care of JoesphPGrant's concern. A small number of languages still have the split, probably because they got it from us. The Finnish Wikipedia has only an article on Symbolic logic, so I have added their interwiki link to the present page. There wasn't much contentat [[Symbolic logic]], and I have not merged any of it anywhere. Some of it seemed to be wrong, and some of it is very elementary and doesn't really belong in such an article anyway. If someone wants to salvage something, there is a huge choice of articles related to propositional logic; perhaps one of them is suitable.

I have left [[Talk:Symbolic logic]] in its old place. It doesn't seem to be very relevant to anything other than the history of the merged article itself. [[User:Hans Adler|Hans]] [[User talk:Hans Adler|Adler]] 13:51, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

== MSC2010 ==

The new classification [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html?t=03-XX&s=&btn=Search&ls=s divides] mathematical logic a bit differently. In particular [[algebraic logic]] is considered a separate subfield containing [[categorical logic]] etc. [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html?t=03Gxx&btn=Current contents].

Speaking of which: the classification has a [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html?t=03Bxx&btn=Current "general logic"] subfield which roughly corresponds to our "formal logic" section (which has a silly heading because all mathlogic is formal). In MSC2010 this is considered to contain quite a bit more stuff than what's mentioned here, including [[substructural logics]], [[many-valued logic]], [[type theory]] etc. I know this stuff isn't normally included in mathlogic textbooks (well, Peter B. Andrews's book cited here is an exception wrt to type theory), so no they should not have more than a passing mention here, but even that is currently lacking (except for type theory in the history section).

::Many-valued logics should be added to the section "Nonclassical and modal logic", and type theory should be added to the "formal logics" section. It's hard to remember everything at first. 

::Not all of mathematical logic is formal, by the way. The meaning there is like the distinction between "formal proof" and "natural language proof".

But my understanding is that mathematical logic deals exactly with the metatheory/metalogic of those rather than of the natural language proofs, with the assumption that one can mechanically formalize them if necessary. (This assumption isn't that easy to put in practice; see for instance [[QED project]] -- it's really called QED ''manifesto'', by the way.

Is mathematical logic consistent?  The "Subfields and scope" section says:

:Contemporary mathematical logic is roughly divided into four areas: set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory and constructive mathematics. 

which would seem to prove that 4=5 ;-).  Can someone straighten this out?  There are two obvious possible solutions and I defer to the experts to figure out which is better.

== Definitions of mathematical logic ==

I have an objection to the restricted sense given to the expression "mathematical logic". It is true that on the one hand it means what you say, that is the exploration of mathematical concepts and workings by means of logic. On the other hand, in a way the converse is true, that is the formalisation and expression of logic by means of typically mathematical disciplines (or in other words the application of mathematical theories and systems to logic). This is especially the case historically, with the developments brought about by the work of the likes of De Moivre and in particular Boole (whose algebra fit perfectly logic concepts that were earlier handle through different means). The history of the intertwined relationship between logic and mathematics, I agree, is far from linear and id still in fruitful progress, but for such reasons I endorse a two-way view on it.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2A01:E35:8AD5:C150:790F:3BD7:736A:B759|2A01:E35:8AD5:C150:790F:3BD7:736A:B759]] ([[User talk:2A01:E35:8AD5:C150:790F:3BD7:736A:B759|talk]]) 11:49, 12 November 2013 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Goedel sentences ==

The Goedel sentence of a consistent theory is true.  That is what reliable sources say, and is also the fact, and that is what we should say.  Not to say it risks continuing the confusion promulgated by the popularizers, all this nonsense about the sentence having a truth value that is in some way problematic.  It's not problematic at all &mdash; it asserts that there is no natural number having a certain primitive-recursive property, and in fact, there is no such number, because if there were, the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to hypothesis.

It is true that there are nonstandard models of arithmetic satisfying the negation of the sentence.  But these are ''nonstandard'' models.  Truth ''sempliciter'' of arithmetic statements is the same as truth in the standard model.  The fact that the nonstandard models are "useful" has nothing to do with anything. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 18:22, 26 May 2015 (UTC)

:"Truth" in mathematics is a technical term.  It is not universally accepted that a formal sentence can be "true" or "false" in an absolute sense at all - "truth" is a model-specific property.  The fact is that there provably exist nonstandard models of arithmetic that obey the peano axioms, and whose theories do not contain contradictions.  To claim otherwise involves importing a distinctly non-formal definition of "truth" and "consistency."  It is true to say that the Goedel sentence is true *in the natural numbers*, but it's not well-justified to treat truth in the natural numbers as some sort of privileged "absolute truth."

::The Goedel sentence is an arithmetic statement.  That means that the natural numbers are what it is ''about''.  (In particular, it is not about the objects of discourse of the formal theory whose Goedel sentence it is, unless that formal theory happens to be a theory of arithmetic.  So for example the objects of discourse of ZFC are sets, not natural numbers, but the objects of discourse of the Goedel sentence of ZFC are natural numbers.)
::It is important, and sourceable, to say that the Goedel sentence of a consistent theory is true.  There is far too much confusion on this point, especially from the popularizers, who like to give the Goedel results a sort of misty glow of something that can be hey-neither-really-true-nor-really-false-wow-man-heavy.  --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 18:55, 26 May 2015 (UTC)

:::::: Well, close.  There isn't any "the" hyperfinite numbers, per se.  There are various nonstandard models (but only one standard one, up to isomorphism).  Some of the nonstandard models satisfy the sentence, and some don't.  But the standard model definitely does satisfy it, and that's what "true" means unless otherwise qualified.
:::::: The problem with this line of discourse is that it leads into the narrative, "oh, well, maybe it's a nonstandard model that's correct, who's to say?".  But that's not really a coherent view.

A statement like "P is true but unprovable" sounds absurd, or worse, profound, to the uninitiated, and perhaps that's part of what fuels those popularizers you keep (justly) complaining about. You can use this as an opportunity to explain to the reader that the Goedel sentence of a consistent theory is true for the model '''N''', and is false for some other model) and ''that's how we know'' it's neither provable nor disprovable within the theory, and also by the way mathematicians may say something is "true" when they really mean that it is provable in the standard model. That's typically the right way to go on all these kinds of issues. More details leads to less philosophy. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 23:24, 26 May 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::: Well, some of your details are not quite right :-).
:::::::::: First, that isn't how we know it's neither provable or disprovable within the theory; having proved that it's neither provable nor disprovable in the theory, we then conclude (using [[Gödel's completeness theorem]]) that there are models that satisfy it and models that falsify it.
:::::::::: Second, mathematicians don't use "true" to mean "provable in the standard model".  They use it (for arithmetic statements, anyway) to mean "true in the standard model", which is different.  (In fact, it's precisely the Gödel results that show it ''has'' to be different.)
:::::::::: The problem with saying "true in the standard model" is that it makes it sound complicated, whereas it's really very simple.  The reader has to ask "what's the standard model?".  Oh, well, first you need to know what a model is.  That's not deep, but it's a fair amount of structure to absorb.  Then you need to find out that the "standard model" is actually just the one you had in mind all along (you know, zero, one, two, three, etc), but explained with all this superstructure around it.
:::::::::: ''Then'' you need to parse out that a statement of arithmetic is "true in the standard model" just in case...now you do the whole Tarski thing inductively on the statement, and the way the "standard model" comes in is that you let the variables range over zero, one, two, etc, and interpret plus and times to mean ordinary addition and multiplication, and it all boils down to an arithmetic statement is "true in the standard model" just in case it's ... true.
:::::::::: These are the kinds of things that can be dealt with in asides; explanatory footnotes (as opposed to references) are especially good for this.  I think that would be a good solution here.  But there shouldn't be any weaseling about whether the statement is true. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 23:56, 26 May 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::: If I'm reading this article these are the main things I want to know, not asides and footnotes. You can generally make math articles look nice by glossing over a lot of fine points, and you may feel like this makes things simpler but actually, to someone unfamiliar with the subject, it ends up being completely opaque. Particularly since this statement involves a specific notion of "true" which may be in common use among mathematicians but is not commonly understood by the article's target audience (e.g. ignorant people like me), that should be explained. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 02:24, 27 May 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::::: I would argue that this is exactly the intuitive, natural-language meaning of "true", and should not be a surprise to the naive reader (except insofar as that reader expects all truths to be provable, but that's a surprise as to what happens, not as to what things mean).
:::::::::::: Example:  What does you mean when you say that every natural number is the sum of four squares?  Do you mean that there's a formal derivation of the string <math>\forall x\exists y\exists z\exists w\exists v (x = y*y + z*z + w*w + v*v)</math>, obtainable by starting with axioms of Peano arithmetic and Hilbert logical axioms and applying modus ponens?
:::::::::::: I don't know you, but I'm going to boldly assert that no, that's not what you mean at all.  What you mean is that if you take any natural number, say 4 or 17 or Graham's number or whatever it be, there really are four natural numbers whose squares sum to that number.
:::::::::::: Well, that's exactly what "true" means in this context. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 03:24, 27 May 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::: My intuitive notion of mathematical "truth" is more like the first thing you said, but I can imagine someone thinking along the lines of your second option. I'm not sure that everyone does, because they would then all say that the Riemann Hypothesis is true because if you apply Riemann's zeta function to any number off the critical line and not a negative even integer, the result is nonzero. (Try it!) Unless what you really mean is that you ''would'' get a nonzero result for ''every'' number if you actually tried it for ''every'' number - that becomes a very unintuitive counterfactual and I'm not sure it's even meaningful. But let's say you accept this. Obviously you can't test it directly, so you then say, okay, it ''might'' be true, but since we can't try every case, we can only assert it's true if there's a proof. So you say a statement is true exactly when there is a proof that it is true, which comports with my original intuition that those are the same thing. Anyway, instead of presupposing that naive readers will think your way or mine, it's best to explain the details of what you really mean. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 03:50, 27 May 2015 (UTC) 
:::::::::::::Actually, that's precisely what I mean when I say that.  I do not think there is something fundamentally special about the natural numbers and that when I speak of arithmetic I am speaking with those in mind, or that statements that are true in that particular model are somehow closer to being "true" in the natural language sense than statements that are true in any other model.  And I'm going to similarly "boldly assert" that I'm not the only person who thinks this way, and that it is bad for this encyclopedia to assume that everyone does.  The wording that I suggested is non-contentious regardless of whether or not you think that the natural language meaning of "truth" somehow lands closer to one model than to another - it is best to assume as little as possible, and leave interpretations to the individual.

I think, the meaning of "true but unprovable" is easier to realize on the well-know example of a Turing machine that seeks a proof (in a given formal system) that it (this machine) will never stop and, if found, it stops. If the formal system proves only true statements, then clearly, the machine will never find the proof of the TRUE statement that it will never stop!

:::I am not an expert in logic, but my feeling is that the POV you mention is in fact the mainstream.

:::::One can assume a certain standard foundation for unqualified statements without believing that that choice of foundation is somehow more "privileged" or "fundamental" than another.  Moreover, there is a stark difference between agreeing that unqualified statements about mathematical objects share some default foundational assumptions than agreeing that formal sentences have some natural-language interpretations that justify privileging some models over other models (the designation of a "standard model" is ''not'' a foundational choice about mathematics - we begin with axioms, not models).  It is one thing to say "A group is a mathematical structure obeying these properties" without further qualification, and quite another to say "this sentence in the language of groups is 'true'" because you happen to think that some model of the group axioms is more special or "real" than another.  The issue being taken here is not one of disputing foundations, it is disputing the use of one's own natural-language interpretation of a formal sentence to provide a distinctly non-mathematical interpretation of something which does not necessarily have any intrinsic meaning.

::::::::: It is standard in mathematics to state results "realistically" even if you are not a realist.  Saves a lot of time, for one thing.  Perhaps more importantly in this case, you don't want to conflate an assertion itself with the provability of that assertion, even if you're a formalist.

::::::::::::Restricting from "arithmetic" to "the natural numbers" (a specific model) is what I meant by going to a larger set of rules. And obviously this has caused confusion. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 17:04, 28 May 2015 (UTC)
:::::::::::::OK, I'm sorry, I find this weird; it's hard for me to buy that you're making this argument seriously.  The natural numbers have been understood at least since Pythagoras (they left out 0 and maybe even 1 but that's a trivial difference); the axiomatizations are maybe 150 years old.  It should be obvious that, at least in this case, the axiomatization has a specific intended interpretation, namely the naturals with ordinary addition and multiplication.
:::::::::::::<small>The case of groups, by the way, is a bad analogy.  In group theory, we study groups, not group elements.  The "axioms" of elementary group theory are axioms in a different sense &mdash; they're really part of the definition of group, which is the object of study.  Arithmetic, on the other hand, does not study models of arithmetic (an interesting topic in its own right, to be sure, but a different one); it studies ''numbers''.</small> --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 17:16, 28 May 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::I'd like you to stop doubting so much and instead accept as empirical fact that not everybody will be on the same page there.

:::::::::::::::Well.  Rick's new language says "in the natural numbers", which you seem to have indicated would satisfy you, so hopefully we can move on.  Actually even from my perspective I suppose it's useful to point out that it's in the natural numbers, to avoid confusion with the objects of discourse of ''T'', which could be something else. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 23:36, 28 May 2015 (UTC)
::::::::::::::::Yes, the current wording seems to me perfectly satisfactory, so I think the current discussion has run it's course - we don't need to generate absolute agreement on the nature of mathematical truth here, only arrive at an acceptable wording for the article.

== How is epistemic/temporal/linear/lax/modal logic connected to mathematical logic? ==

Can someone explain how this new table in the "Formal logical systems" section is connected to mathematical logic?

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Logical Judgement !! Branch of Logic !! Computation phenomenon
|-
| K knows A || Epistemic Logic || Distributed Computing
|-
| A is true at time t || Temporal Logic || Reactive Programming (partial evaluation)
|-
| A is a resource || Linear Logic || Concurrent Computation
|-
| A is possible || Lax Logic || Generic effects (monads, state, exception)
|-
| A is valid || Modal Logic || Runtime code generation
|}

If this table really does belong here, it's going to need some sort of explanation. A search for "Lax logic" in wikipedia doesn't find much.<br>

:It doesn't have a citation and is far too much without a citation so it should just be removed. [[User:Dmcq|Dmcq]] ([[User talk:Dmcq|talk]]) 13:55, 1 January 2016 (UTC)

Yes, that's what I think too. But I'm not a top expert on this stuff. People who know more than me might know how this kind of thing fits in. So I'm reluctant to delete other people's contributions. I prefer to leave that to people who fully understand this topic area. But in the 45 books on mathematical logic on my personal bookshelf, there's some peripheral mention of modal logic, but nothing about the other four kinds of logic, and there's nothing about runtime code generation either. Maybe this table is related to some kinds of computer software packages for symbolic logic. Either way, it either needs a really good explanation (and citations), or it needs to be removed. If it's about computer logic software, maybe there's another article where this table will make sense. Mathematical logic is already difficult enough to understand without interpolating (at best) peripherally related material into it.<br>

:Well they are all valid forms of mathematical logic, but the article overall has far too few references. It really is a bit of a mess that way. I think I'll add some tags on sections which have no citations at all. [[User:Dmcq|Dmcq]] ([[User talk:Dmcq|talk]]) 14:41, 1 January 2016 (UTC)

== Was first-order logic really designed to avoid Russell's Paradox? ==

This currently appears in the section [[Mathematical logic#First-order logic|First-order logic]].

: First-order logic is a kind of formal system of logic designed to avoid Russell's Paradox.

This doesn't sound right to me at all. I've never read this anywhere, and the name "Russell" does not appear in the [[First-order logic]] article. As far as I know, Russell's paradox is a set theory issue, not a first-order language (predicate calculus) logic issue. The paradox is resolved in ZF by the regularity axiom, and it is resolved in NBG by distinguishing sets from classes.

The idea that preventing self-referential propositions in first-order logic prevents Russell's paradox also seems wrong. You can very easily make minor changes to ZF and NBG axioms to permit Russell's paradox to occur. So I don't see that FOL has any power to stop the paradox at all.

Conclusion: Either someone's got to back up the assertion with a reference, or it has to be corrected.<br>

== Lack of current references for the history and current state of the subject. ==

Although there are many inline citations in this article to classic historical papers, there are very few references which justify the picture which is painted in this article of both the history and current state of the subject. Many of the paragraphs seem quite dubious to me, just one particular view of the subject and one view of history, and some assertions seem to be false. Just adding citations of classic papers from a hundred years ago does not justify at all the picture which is painted of the scope of the whole subject and its history, nor of the particular assertions which are made. What is needed is more references to particular pages of particular reasonably recent books which cover this subject, especially for assertions which are dubious, controversial or tendentious. I definitely have the impression that this article is inadequately justified.<br>
--[[User:Alan U. Kennington|Alan U. Kennington]] ([[User talk:Alan U. Kennington|talk]]) 03:03, 2 January 2016 (UTC)

:It would help if you could identify, on this talk page, some claims that seem false or tendentious to you. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 03:16, 2 January 2016 (UTC)

See for example the previous section of this talk page: [[Talk:Mathematical logic#Was first-order logic really designed to avoid Russell's Paradox?]] I prefer not to make a long list because I don't want to get into prolonged discussions. Life is too short of unproductive adversarial arguments. (Editors on wikipedia typically defend their opinions to the death, especially if they are wrong.) One merely has to read through the article to see that most of the material is a kind of essay which mostly refers to classic papers, not so much to references which support the assertions which are made about history and the current subject.<br>
--[[User:Alan U. Kennington|Alan U. Kennington]] ([[User talk:Alan U. Kennington|talk]]) 03:22, 2 January 2016 (UTC)

: I think the previous section of the talk page was very apropos, and I have reverted that section of the article to a previous version, which is at least somewhat better. I agree with what you say about long lists, so why not simply mention the main two issues you see? I will attempt to improve them within the month. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 03:30, 2 January 2016 (UTC)

Good idea. I'll review the page and make a short list of comments over the next few days. I know enough to say that something is dubious, or even wrong. But I am not a specialist in this area. So I prefer to let others do the fixing, as you have done. Hopefully other people will contribute their lists of dubious passages too!<br>
