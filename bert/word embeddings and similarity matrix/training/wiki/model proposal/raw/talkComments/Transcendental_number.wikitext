=="too well approximated"==

Is it supposed to read "well approximated," or is there a specific meaning to  "too well approximated"?

: I expect the author of that sentence ''did'' mean “too well”, in the sense of “too well to be algebraic”.

==the proof that e is transcendental is too rushed at the end==

the proof proceeds in a simple-to-follow fashion up until the end when the P<sub>2</sub> partition of the algebraic equation for e is supposedly shown to satisfy:  |P<sub>2</sub> / k!| < 1

at this point an auxiliary function is defined, separated into two factors, but then the rest of the explanation degenerates rapidly.

it isn't clear what is meant by "using upper bounds" or how this is related to the following limit regarding G^k / k!

it would be nice if someone would unpack this part of the proof somewhat so that it can be digested as easily as P<sub>1</sub> / k! being in Z-{0}  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.182.194.195|76.182.194.195]] ([[User talk:76.182.194.195|talk]]) 09:30, 15 March 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

misplaced text on misspelt page:

(This has now been incorporated into the article on the correctly spelled page.

This is annoying me: ''This and other "Liouville numbers" are artificial examples, rather than numbers that directs our attention to it in a natural way. The first important number --- an eminently "natural" example ---''. Are "artificial" transcendental numbers less important than so called "natural" ones? I think not. Just think on Lioville's discovery. I guess the first ones who thought about transcendentality of numbers were [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in late [[18th century]]. In the beginning of [[19th century]] all mathematicians have agreed that their hypotheses are correct. Liouville gave a final step, regardless of non-naturality of his numbers. It is the idea that counts. Best regards. --[[User:XJamRastafire|XJam]] 23:18 Dec 23, 2002 (UTC)


I'm not even sure the "artificial" / "natural" distinction makes sense. The Liouville number ''seems'' constructed -- but so is ''e'', if you define it as a summation. Even its definition as the base of natural log is artificial -- we've defined it as "the number that is the base of natural log". Why is that more natural than "the number whose nth digit is 1 if n is ... bla bla" ? -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 23:24 Dec 23, 2002 (UTC)
:Yes, why? :-) Perhaps [[Pi|&pi;]] is the most "natural" as the other numbers... Perhaps. --[[User:XJamRastafire|XJamRastafire]] 23:36 Dec 23, 2002 (UTC)

I have a feeling that besides pi and ''e'', the original author would be hard pressed to give an example of a "natural" number which is transcendental - since there doesn't seem to be an obvious sense of what "natural" is supposed to imply here - constructible? computable? commonly used? "useful"? or what? If I read the article a few more times, I'm sure it will irk me enough to "boldy edit" the distinction out of existence. [[User:Chas zzz brown|Chas zzz brown]] 00:46 Dec 24, 2002 (UTC)

Since a trans.number is an infinite decimal, we can never write it down precisely as a decimal expansion -- thus we ''cannot'' define it as a decimal (unlike, say, 10. I can just point to "10" and say -- baboom! that's 10). So one ''has'' to define a trans.number with some sort of ''method'' or expression. The construction of Liouville's number is no worse a method than pi, which is usually defined as a tan^-1 expansion IIRC. ''be bold''! -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 02:02 Dec 24, 2002 (UTC)

This raises an interesting point, because it follows from what you've just said that transcendental numbers must be countable. If they have to be defined by some sort of method, then they have to have a "generating rule" and these rules can be embedded in space-time geometry - most obviously, by when and where they were first defined or thought of. Thus, the rules and hence the numbers can be counted.

What does "''The general case of [[Hilbert's seventh problem]], namely to determine whether a<sup>b</sup> is transcendental whenever a &#8800; 0,1 is algebraic and b is irrational, remains unresolved''" mean?  <br>
It has been solved by Gelfond when ''b'' is irrational algebraic - the answer is "yes".

Well, it already says "The set of transcendental numbers is uncountably infinite." and proves it by showing that the algebraics are countable, which ''a fortiori'' makes them countable in any interval, so yes, "almost all" reals are transcendental, but given the multiple technical meanings of [[almost all]] (''q.v.''), I'm not sure that adds anything. --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 18:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

You cannot say that "most real numbers are irrational and transcendental", because an infinitude of both exists. Although it seems like you ''can'' say that there are twice as many integers as there are natural numbers, because each natural number has a negative, this is not correct, as there is an infinitude of both. You cannot compare infinity with itself - you cannot divide infinity by infinity (∞/∞) - in other words, you cannot treat it as a number; you can only talk about a limit. So for real numbers - an infinitude of rationals and irrationals, algebraics and transcendentals exists, and the smallest line segment contains infinitely many of each.

::Although at first it seems that there ''are'' different sizes of infinities, we can actually show that they can sometimes be made equivalent to eachother. Consider, for example, the set of integer points on a plane. It is reasonable to say that the number of these points is 4∞<sup>2</sup>, because the plane is a 2D figure with dimensions of 2∞ * 2∞; the number of integer points on a line, like I already said, can be considered to be 2∞ - the line is a two-sided infinity, the ray is one-sided. Yet, we can equate the set of integer points on a ''plane'' to the natural sequence - set of integer points on a ''ray'', as shown in the picture.

::::I realize this is almost a decade old, but since I witnessed someone else being confused by the same point and not understanding the explanation here, so I'll expand a bit on Sławomir Biały's answer.

::::The reason the demonstration is irrelevant is that proving that ∞ = 4∞<sup>2</sup> does not prove that ∞ = 2<sup>∞</sup>.

::::More fundamentally, there are a variety of different ways of defining arithmetic on infinite quantities, and they all work differently. Some systems have just a single infinity, some have lots of them, and there are plenty of other differences (e.g., some are noncommutative, or only partially ordered, etc.). So you can't just mix and match; you have to choose the one that fits what you're talking about. When you're talking about the sizes of sets, the system you want is [cardinal arithmetic].

::::In some of those systems, like the projective reals, both ∞ = 4∞<sup>2</sup> and ∞ = 2<sup>∞</sup> are true. In others, like nonstandard analysis, they're both false. In cardinal arithmetic, the first one is true but the second is false. By the rules of cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal κ, κ = 2κ, and κ = κ<sup>2</sup>, but κ < 2<sup>κ</sup>.

::::Why do we use the rules of cardinal arithmetic when dealing with cardinalities of sets? Because they codify what you actually want to talk about. The image that demonstrates ∞ = 4∞<sup>2</sup> is really just demonstrating that you can put the integral plane Z<sup>2</sup> in bijection with the natural numbers N, and that's exactly why κ = 2κ and κ = κ<sup>2</sup> are true. Similarly, [Cantor's diagonal argument] shows that the real numbers R cannot be put in bijection with the natural numbers N (and, more generally, the power set of any set is too large to put in bijection with that set), and that's why κ < 2<sup>κ</sup>.

::::So, there are different sizes of infinity for cardinal numbers (but there aren't in other systems, like the projective real plane), and doubling and squaring doesn't give you a different infinity (but it does in other systems, like the ordinals), but exponentiating does.

==Contradiction  between [[Algebraic numbers]] and  [[Transcendental number]]==
The article [[Transcendental number]] states that 
<blockquote>
In mathematics, a transcendental number is a real or complex number which is not algebraic, i.e., not a solution of a non-zero polynomial equation with '''integer''' coefficients.
</blockquote>

whereas in the article [[Algebraic numbers]] the following is stated:
<blockquote>
In mathematics, an algebraic number is a complex number that is an algebraic element over the rational numbers. In other words, an algebraic number is a root of a non-zero polynomial with '''rational (or equivalently, integer)''' coefficients.
</blockquote>

Is it only integer coefficients or rational coefficients? [[User:Hakeem.gadi|Hakeem.gadi]] 09:29, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

There is no contradiction, since the roots of a polynomial with rational coefficients are also the roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients.  Consider the rational polynomial ''an/bn * x^n + ... a1/b1 * x + a0/b0''.  It has the same roots as the integer polynomial ''An * x^n + ... + A1 * x + A0'', where Ai = ai * product(bi,i,0,n).  In fact, if the coefficients are known to be ''algebraic'' themselves, then the roots will also be algebraic.  We could of course add the phrase "(or equivalently, rational)" to the transcendental page heading, but it's best to keep it simple. --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 12:00, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

== A number that is infinitely small, like PI, is considered a transcendental number. So should a number that is infinitely big, be considered for categorization into transcendental numbers. ==

The point of having a "Numbers for which it is unknown whether they are transcendental or not" pretty much explains its self. Putting my suggestion there is valid, and is the only correct spot on the page to suggest a link, to discuss the topic.   

THE FACT THAT ITS NONSENCE in YOUR OPINION doesn't mean that it dosen't deserve a chance to be discussed to an indepth degree.   

Even if you have a PHD in "WHATEVER", doesn't change the fact that a bit of imagination, along with a proper level of common sense would go along way in helping old people that are unwilling to accept new ideas and math.   Most ideas aren't accepted by the old generation, even if they are PROVEN to be correct. They are accepted because the OLD PEOPLE DIE, and the younger generation that has already accepted it now have the control.    Having some PHD say that something is nonsence, is nothing new.   WHY DON'T YOU MATHEMATICALLY PROVE THAT ITS NONSENCE, MR PHD.  
But coming up with a NEW math, new ideas, and sharing them takes more guts and effort than most with a PHD will ever have.   Too afraid of getting heckled.

The number PI that is infinitely big is a transcendental number

Like it or lump it, discuss it.

== Euclidean geometry ==

Recent addition: “Another way of looking at transcendental numbers is that they are numbers that do not arise from euclidean geometry or ordinary algebraic expressions.” What is this supposed to mean? The number π certainly “arises” from Euklidean geometry, since circles do. Or is this a reference to non-constructible numbers? But many non-constructible numbers are algebraic. In my opinion, the sentence is too vague to be of any use.

== Should the definition include irrationality? ==

The intro of this article states that "a transcendental number is an irrational number that is not algebraic."  However, the [[algebraic number]] article trivially proves that every rational number is algebraic—equivalently, that every transcendental number must be irrational anyway.  That is, defining a transcendental number as "an irrational number that is not algebraic" is equivalent to defining it as "a number that is not algebraic."  It seems to me that it could simply say, "a transcendental number is a number that is not algebraic," and later, "every transcendental number is irrational because…."

The opening line of the article says that transcendental numbers are complex numbers that are not algebraic.  Unless you consider reals to be a subset of complex numbers, this statement is misleading.

== Who first defined transcendental numbers? ==
The History section starts out as "Euler was probably the first person to define transcendental numbers in the modern sense." Just today, I read in the book Mathematics in Ancient Greece (Dover Books on Mathematics) (Paperback) by Tobias Dantzig that in fact it was Leibniz (spelled as Leibnitz in the book -- which is also an accepted spelling) that introduced the concept of transcendental numbers (as well as transcendental functions); the comment is, as I recall, on p. 142, but I don't
have the copy of the book available here, and in any case, one can easily find the page by looking in the index. He called the algebraic numbers "analytic numbers", according to the book.

I'm sure my confusion here stems from the difference between algebraic and transcendental ''functions'' vs. ''numbers'', but the [[Transcendental number#History|History]] section states:
: "''Euler was probably the first person to define transcendental numbers in the modern sense. The name 'transcendentals' comes from Leibniz in his 1682 paper where he proved sin ''x'' is not an algebraic function of ''x''.''"
And then:
: ''Joseph Liouville first proved the existence of transcendental numbers in 1844''..."
Wait a minute. If Leibniz proved that sine was not algebraic, then once Euler defined the term, wouldn't that have immediately implied the existence of transcendental numbers (namely, certain values of the sine function)? I guess what I really need to know is, what's the relationship between [[transcendental function]]s and [[transcendental number]]s? I don't see that explained in either article. - [[User:Dcljr|dcljr]] <small>([[User talk:Dcljr|talk]])</small> 03:05, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

:If you plug an algebraic number into an algebraic function, you get out an algebraic number.  There's no general rule for transcendental functions, though.

But there are examples dating back to Weierstrass of transcendental functions that pop out a rational result whenever a rational number is input.  And more recently it was shown that you can make transcendental functions that always return an algebraic number if you put in an algebraic number.  And then there are functions where we don't know what happens if you put in an algebraic number, like exp(exp(x)).  To answer your question, then, there really isn't much of a relationship between them, they're just both examples of transcendental elements of a certain field extension.

== Mahler-Sprindzhuk theorem ==

I find it difficult to believe this theorem as I understand Baker has stated it. I could more easily believe that almost all real numbers have measure of transcendence = 1.

For any irrational real x, its measure of irrationality ω(x,1) is at least 1. If the type of x is the supremum of the set {ω(x,n)} it would follow that ω(x,1) = 1 for almost all real numbers x.

A regular continued fraction can be constructed to represent a real number with an arbitrarily large measure of irrationality. I suspect that such a number can be constructed to have a measure of irrationality with any arbitrary value > 1. This sounds to me like a set of non-zero measure.

All numbers x with ω(x,1) > 1 are transcendental by [[Roth's theorem]]. [[User:Scott Tillinghast, Houston TX|Scott Tillinghast, Houston TX]] ([[User talk:Scott Tillinghast, Houston TX|talk]]) 23:59, 25 September 2010 (UTC)

== Approximation of Liouville Numbers ==

I have a problem with the following sentence in the history section:

:"Liouville showed that this number is what we now call a Liouville number; this essentially means that it [I assume a louivelle number] can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than can any algebraic number."

Many algebraic numbers ''are'' rational so can be exactly approximated (if you'll excuse the oxymoron) by a rational number leaving little room for louiville numbers to be ''more'' closely approximated by irrational numbers. I fact tagged this a while back as it seemed contradictory but it was removed by Hanche. I asked him about it on his Talk but haven't received a response.

Looking at the Louiville number article, I wonder if it should read:

:"Liouville showed that this number is what we now call a Liouville number; this essentially means that it can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than can any '''irrational''' algebraic number."

In any case pure maths isn't really my thing so I've not edited it as yet but need to either see the article or my misunderstanding corrected.....
[[User:IanOfNorwich|IanOfNorwich]] ([[User talk:IanOfNorwich|talk]]) 21:03, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

If the number in question is rational, then it is a matter of approximating it by ''other'' rational numbers whose denominators are not too large. If a rational number has denominator q, then no other rational number with denominator less or equal can be closer than 1/q<sup>2</sup>. Liouville numbers do not follow this rule. A Liouvile number has in its neighborhood rational numbers that are remarkably close considering their denominators.

Let integer r≤q. Then s/r-p/q = (sq-rp)/qr. Because sq-rp is an integer, its absolute value ≥1 (unless 0). Hence |s/r-p/q| ≥ 1/qr ≥ 1/q<sup>2</sup>. [[User:Scott Tillinghast, Houston TX|Scott Tillinghast, Houston TX]] ([[User talk:Scott Tillinghast, Houston TX|talk]]) 05:52, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

::OK, Thanks Scott, I think I follow what you're saying. At least I see the proof that no rational number with denominator <= q can be closer than 1/q<sup>2</sup> to a rational number with denominator q. Though I have to confess I can't see how this helps without establishing the denominator of the liousville number!? I guess "small denominators" hints at how the proof works but seems a bit vague here - how small exactly? 

::What is this sentence trying to do - define Liousville numbers or outline the proof that they are transcendental? It doesn't seem to do either accurately. How about:

::"This is an example of what are now called Liouville numbers." [[User:IanOfNorwich|IanOfNorwich]] ([[User talk:IanOfNorwich|talk]]) 20:48, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

When I say small denominator I mean small considering how close the rational number is to the number (irrational or rational) being approximated. Example: the Liouville constant has an approximation with denominator 10<sup>n!</sup>, but the error is < (10/9)10<sup>-(n+1)!</sup>, like the reciprocal of the 10th power of the denominator.

Only rational numbers have denominators, although algebraic numbers have a height, which is a related concept. The height of a rational number is the absolute value of its numerator or denominator, whichever is greater.

==Wait a second==

Currently, the article states that Leibniz proved that sin(x) is not constructible algebraically, which is to say (in today's terminology) that it is transcendental.  But then we say that Liouville proved that transcendentals exist in 1844.  These can't both be true.  If Leibniz actually proved that sin(x) can't be found algebraically, than surely that's a constructive proof of the existence of transcendental numbers.  [[User:Ethan Mitchell|Ethan Mitchell]] ([[User talk:Ethan Mitchell|talk]]) 00:15, 4 August 2011 (UTC)

:A function being transcendental doesn't imply that it has to take transcendental values at any algebraic argument, it's possible to construct a perfectly nice transcendental function ''f'' such that ''f''(''x'') is algebraic whenever ''x'' is algebraic.

:The issue is that the usual definition of "irrational number" is as a subset of the reals, since "rational numbers" are also a subset of the reals — they are defined as a/b where a and b are integers, so do not include the [[Gaussian rational|complex rationals]] like 1/2 - 23/14*i.

==Bell quote==

The article currently reads:
:E. T. Bell in his ''Men of Mathematics'' summarized this as the metaphor, "The algebraic numbers are spotted over the plane like stars against a black sky; the dense blackness is the firmament of the transcendentals." Despite the metaphor, it should be noted that the algebraic numbers form a dense subset of the complex plane.
As the comment says, this is a misleading, indeed incorrect, characterization of the algebraics. After all, there is an algebraic number between any two transcendental numbers (= dense subset). Heck, there is a rational number between any two transcendentals (truncate at the first different digit).
I suggest we simply remove this quote, because it does not help the reader understand the topic, and may actually confuse him or her. --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] ([[User talk:Macrakis|talk]]) 19:11, 17 February 2018 (UTC)

:The Bell quote was added July 29, 2017‎. Since the history goes back to September 8, 2001‎, this makes it a recent addition. In general, Bell's Men of Mathematics does not have a good reputation for accuracy. For example, in [[Georg Cantor#Historiography]]: 

::Until the 1970s, the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] (1927) – largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler – and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at second and third hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by [[Eric Temple Bell]]'s ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as "perhaps the most widely read modern book on the [[history of mathematics]]"; and as "one of the worst". [Reference to: Grattan-Guinness 1971, p. 350.] Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as Oedipal, Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics, and fills the picture with stereotypes. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative.

:So it doesn't surprise me that Bell's metaphor is "a misleading, indeed incorrect, characterization of the algebraics." Since this is an article that may appeal to novices in mathematics, it is very important that we do not confuse them. So I vote to remove the quote. If someone really wants it for some reason, it can be relegated to a footnote that starts off by stating that the following misleading metaphor was used by Bell and then explains why it is misleading. --[[User:RJGray|RJGray]] ([[User talk:RJGray|talk]]) 19:42, 17 February 2018 (UTC)

== Irrationality of e+π and e*π ==

This article claims to prove that e+π and e*π are both irrational numbers:
