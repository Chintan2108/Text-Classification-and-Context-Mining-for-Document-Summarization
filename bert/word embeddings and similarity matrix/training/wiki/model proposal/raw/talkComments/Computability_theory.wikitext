== Should this page even exist? ==

I was checking out this disambiguation page with a view towards disambiguating the links, and I wonder: should this page exist?  I am sure that there are some set theorists who have used the term "computability theory" to describe [[recursion theory]], but I'm willing to bet that if I were to go through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Computability_theory the links to this page] all, or almost all, should point to [[computability theory (computer science)]].  Now, of course I could be wrong which is why I am asking here.  Any comments?   --[[User:Deville|Deville]] ([[User talk:Deville|Talk]]) 12:33, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

: I'd prefer an unequal disambiguation to [[computability theory (computer science)]], but only if [[User:Trovatore]] is fine with it as well. —''[[User:R.Koot|Ruud]]'' 12:45, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

::Really I think they should probably never have been split; I'd prefer a re-merge at some point. At the time of the split the article was written too much from the computer science perspective. That ought to have been corrected, but it's tricky to do right. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 13:59, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:::This really should just be one page, there's no point in seperating the two pages as they discuss the same topic just from different points of view.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.180.67.188|85.180.67.188]] ([[User talk:85.180.67.188|talk]]) 00:50, 11 January 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Do we agree that among the pioneers of computability theory is Kleene, that Moschovakis is an eminence grise, Soare, Ted Slaman, and Rod Downey are established current figures, Denis Hirschfeldt and Joel Hamkins are up-and-comers? If so, we're talking about the same subject, and we should really have one article. The problem with the [[computability theory (computer science)]] article is it spends too much time defining computability and establishing that it's distinct from non-computability, and not enough outlining current areas of research. The basic exposition should be shipped off to, say, the [[computable function]] article or the [[Turing machine]] article (it may already be there), and linked to from the main article with a brief blurb. There should then be sections for various current areas of research, each with a blurb and a link to a main article. They would include complexity theory, structure of the Turing degrees, randomness theory (not sure that's what it's called; I'm talking about the kind of stuff Downey and Hirschfeldt do), and effective descriptive set theory. And other things that y'all think of (I'm not really sure what computer scientists who call themselves computability theorists actually study). --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 14:39, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

I don't think there is anything wrong with two articles because of the different emphasis. But please: they are the same subject. My book Computability and Unsolvability (1958 and still around thanks to Dover) is certainly recursion theory. There's really no need for a disambiguation page. Soare has been on a campaign to use "computable" not "recursive". Recursive functions are computable functions - they are the same thing. [[User:Martin Davis|Martin Davis]] 22:34, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

:Of course you're right. This is largely my fault (the other part of the fault would belong to those who wrote the computability theory article before I got to it). The article at that time was very boring and had a lot of repetitive stuff (duplicative of other articles, to boot) about what was computable and what wasn't; I didn't feel comfortable weeding it out the way it needed to be weeded, to make room for more interesting material. Maybe you'd like to take a crack at it? --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] 23:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Why is this page a double dab? Shouldn't [[computable]] be its own dab page? [[User:Pohta ce-am pohtit|Pcap]] [[User_talk:Pohta ce-am pohtit|<small>ping</small>]] 17:14, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

== Reorganization ==

The page [[Recursion theory]] was moved here, as part of a larger reorganization. Centralized discussion is at [[Talk:Recursion theory#Reorganize the Computability articles]]. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 14:53, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

:I have started the reorganization. Let's keep the discussion in the same location, [[Talk:Recursion theory#Reorganize the Computability articles]], even though [[recursion theory]] is a redirect now. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 15:20, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

== Weak and strong ==

Computability theorists have an odd sense of "weak" and "strong".  
* First, there is a very old usage of "strong reducibility" to mean "many-one reducibility", due to Shapiro. I think this has vanished now, but it is in Davis 1958. 
* Second, there is a classical use documented in Rogers 1967, p 138, where Turing and truth-table reductions are "the weak reducibilities" and many-one and one-one reductions are "the strong reducibilities". 

In modern computability terminology, if ≤<sub>A</sub> implies ≤<sub>B</sub> then A is said to be stronger than B. Equivalently, as  Odifreddi, "Strong reducibilities", p. 43, says:
:"Every degree of a weaker reducibility is the union of degrees of stronger reducibilities" 

This may seem backwards if you think of reducibilities as equivalence relations first; but if you think of them as computational processes, a stronger reducibility carries with it more information than a weaker reducibility. So from weak to strong, we have

: arithmetical &larr; Turing &larr; truth-table &larr; many-one

I tried to fix this in the article just now, but I also have to think about the terminology to get it right. One difficulty is that computability theorists generally study particular reducibilities, rather than the general theory of reducibilites. I found a paper online that gave a general definition of "stronger reducibility" [http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/biography/jcss_38.pdf] but I don't think it's a very good reference for this article. I would look in Odifreddi's book but I don't have a copy at hand. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 22:09, 6 April 2010 (UTC)

:PS There are also "strong" and "weak" reducibilites corresponding to [[Medvedev degree]]s and [[Muchnik degree]]s of sets of reals, respectively. This is a different setting; I just wanted to complete my taxonomy of the terms. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 22:12, 6 April 2010 (UTC)

== Say what? ==

The second paragraph of the article begins with:

       The basic questions addressed by recursion theory are "What does it mean for a function from the natural numbers to themselves to be computable?"  ...

We seem to have a grammatical glitch here. What is the intent?  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Toddcs|Toddcs]] ([[User talk:Toddcs|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Toddcs|contribs]]) 19:07, 31 March 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Headings ==

I've just accidentally used rollback, rather than undo; so couldn't leave an edit summary. My reason was to restore MOS-compliant, semantic and accessible sub-headings to the references section, instead of broken definition-list markup. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (User:<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Andy's talk]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:38, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

::The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Section headings|MoS mandates]] that headings should use proper, nested heading markup ("''Spaced or unspaced multiple equal signs are the style markup for headings''"). Can you say in what way the use of definition list markup - specifically <code><nowiki><dl><dt>Foobar</dt></dl></nowiki></code> - for things which aren't definition lists is "fine"? <s>And explain why you have again reverted, with no informative edit summary?</s> <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (User:<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Andy's talk]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 15:22, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

I would prefer not to switch to multicolumn references here. The normal way people format bibliographies in math books is to have one column of references, not two. Two narrow columns are much harder to read, and there's no lack of space in a browser window. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 13:09, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:Two things should be separated:

:2: You removed <nowiki>{{refbegin|2}} and {{refend}}</nowiki>.
:The first thing is what Pigsonthewing commented on. It does not help you to get one column of references, so it is better to leave it the old way. Pigsonthewing showed that the MOS requires this.
:The second thing is what helps you to get multicolumn references. On my screen, two columns makes it easier to read, one column is more difficult. There might be something in the Manual of Style (MOS) about this, but I don't know where. --[[User:EdgeNavidad|EdgeNavidad]] <small>([[User talk:EdgeNavidad|Talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/EdgeNavidad|Contribs]])</small> 16:13, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

::As above, '''I''' did not revert the section heading change. However, I don't think those are really subsection headings in the first place. They are simply bold text that is meant to group the references in the single section "references". That is subtly different than making three subsections; instead it is a single section consisting of three lists, each of which has a title. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 17:56, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

Definition list markup is not broken; [[WP:MOS#Wikilinks|MOS uses it itself]]. The questions to be asked are
*Is the list going to be too busy if every bold-face entry has a line break after it? (Not germane here; the line breaks exist either way.)
*Do we want the individual subsection headers in the Table of Contents? (Probably not; few people are going to want to click on them directly.)
In short, this is a close and unimportant issue, to be decided solely on the basis of the reader's convenience. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] <small>[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]</small> 19:48, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

{od}I agree that "''Definition list markup is not broken''" and did not claim otherwise; however the partial definition list markup used on this article is. The cited MoS section does not use definition list markup. Bold text that is meant to group [things]" is a heading. Headings, per accessibility guidelines, should use heading markup. Accessibility is not "''unimportant''" Inaccessibility is very inconvenient so some. To what aspect of this do you both object? <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (User:<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Andy's talk]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 21:18, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:Fair enough. That is a third question:
:*Does the advantage of increased accessibility for screen readers, which serve a minority, outweigh the disadvantage of unnecessary links in the ToC, which affects everybody, including those with screen readers? 
:*:Quite honestly, I'm not sure. It depends, I think, on how screen readers generally parse '''bold''' text. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] <small>[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]</small> 22:12, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
::You haven't demonstrated that there are "''unnecessary links in the ToC''", much less that they "''[affect] everybody, including those with screen readers''". <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (User:<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Andy's talk]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 22:22, 22 April 2011 (UTC)
:::I haven't demonstrated anything - but is there a case that ''anybody'' would want to click on these subsections? As for the second question: exaggerated TOCs (let us say, as a ''reductio ad absurdam'', 100 lines of table) would be a large cost to anybody; a screen-reader, which will read all those lines, would increase that cost. The three or four more lines involved here are lesser, but proportionate costs. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] <small>[[User talk:Pmanderson|PMAnderson]]</small> 22:39, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

:::::According to the YouTube video, "the headings on the page can give you a  very good idea what the author wanted to stand out". This page ''does'', of course, use HTML headings, which are in the TOC. The question is whether we want the three lists inside the "references" section to stand out on their own in the TOC. I don't think there is any reason for them to be in the TOC, and someone with a screen reader will still be able to find the references by listening to the TOC. &mdash;&nbsp;Carl <small>([[User:CBM|CBM]]&nbsp;·&nbsp;[[User talk:CBM|talk]])</small> 13:52, 23 April 2011 (UTC)
::::::No, this is very much not a question about the TOC. Most web pages, as referred to in that video have no TOC. We use headings to make things "stand out" '''on the page''' (and are currently abusing broken definition list markup to do so). We also use headings to make our articles navigable (by ordinary users, assistive technology users, and search bots). If we get the headings right, and the TOC is thus wrong, then we need to fix the way the TOC is built, not break the headings. This is also no longer a matter about just this article; I propose we move they debate to the MoS or Accessibility talk pages. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (User:<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Andy's talk]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:35, 23 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::::Discussing it at the MOS is fine, but I think that the issue of the TOC is also important.

To make this good, I'd have to go through the various papers and find out where they're located in ''The Undecidable'' (not a problem).

: It's quite unusual to group articles by the collection/journal/etc. they have been published in, in bibliogrpahies. In particular, this collection seems to be a collection of reprints of previously published papers. This makes the approach somewhat infeasible as it would not form a tree-structure. In these cases I would list either the whole collection, or some/all of the papers contained within it separately, or perhaps even both, but not in such a hierarchy. —''[[User:Ruud Koot|Ruud]]'' 23:20, 23 April 2011 (UTC)

I feel less strongly about citing collections like ''The Undecidable'', but for the sake of an encyclopedia article I can see some benefit in listing it for readers who may realize it's a useful purchase. Still, I like to have the papers alphabetized by author, not by editor of a collection.

==After trying for an hour==
To find a way to make this article useful to students, I have given up. Lede contains content that appears superficially, and only in the lede.

== "Predates and predetermines" ==

Turing's work did not "predetermine" modern computers, but different versions were constructed in several locations independently of Turing's work (as any modern history book on computing will tell).  Even more importantly, Charles Babbage's programmable Analytical Engine would have been Turing complete, so Turing's work certainly did not "predate" computers.  Babbage's work happened almost a hundred years earlier.
