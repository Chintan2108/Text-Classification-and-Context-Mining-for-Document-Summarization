== Let's discuss ==

I don't mind adding in motivations, etc. but your additions need a bit of work. Will add edits with notes in a bit. Mostly considerations of language and target audience, etc. [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 10:39, 10 November 2018 (UTC)

:::Well, I don't mind being given the chance to learn on improvements to my writing. I will abuse the tq-template in inserting my remarks directly into your structure. If this intrusion is considered or turns out as inappropriate for some reason, do not hesitate to simply revert my edit. [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy]] ([[User talk:Purgy Purgatorio|talk]]) 19:50, 10 November 2018 (UTC)
* Edit 1: In everyday experience, people do not routinely measure or think about SQUARED distances or times. A bit verbose.
::{{tq|I was aware of having been wordy, but I am convinced that hammering on the facts that spacetime coordinates have both spatial and temporal components pays the rent for newbie readers. Maybe, hammering that the  <math>\Delta</math>'s (pls, allow for the idiotic apostrophe) in <math>x</math> and <math>t</math> are  squared differences and not differences of squared values, but with <math>s</math> it's about the difference of squares, and the "square" has here the meaning of, hmm, what?, is too much. I'm always unsure how to be wordy enough, but not too much. I definitely want the items <math>\Delta t^2</math> '''and''' <math>\Delta x^2</math> to appear separately, to contrast these two independent Galilean invariants to the only one remaining STR invariant <math>\Delta s^2.</math>}}   
* Edit 2: I believe that a majority of working physicists consider classical physics to mean non-quantum physics, i.e. relativity would be a classical theory.
::{{tq|I give in to "classic" being wrong, but I do want some serious physics in there, to have some contrast to the non-scientific "everyday" experience: Galilean, pre-Einsteinian, non-relativistic, ...}}
::: How about "pre-relativistic physics"?
* Edit 3: Counterintuitive to whom? Let's not scare the audience too soon. Also, how new is new? I think 100+ years is not new. :-)
::{{tq|We are acquainted to two Galilean (near)-invariants, and the spacetime interval is in a non-trivial way a new one. I gave two reasons,''at least'', for counterintuitivity. I thought nowadays they scream for trigger-warnings, mine should scare them away? ;) }}
* Edit 4: Most students who have learned about Cartesian coordinates are perfectly comfortable with positive and negative distances, times, temperatures etc. Reference to "positive definite", "imaginary time" and "metric signature" should be relegated to a Note, since no attempt is made to provide an inline definition for the reader. They are just "throwaway" terms.
::{{tq|In math, "distances" are non-negative, it takes "pesudo-distances" (like pseudo-Riemannian) to let them be negative. I have no precise notion covering "throwaway term", I introduced these terms for the possibly rare species that wants to connect their acquaintance with STR with rigorous math, or to satisfy their free associations (i² {{=}} -1).}}
::: Pushing to a note preserves your thoughts on this while not interrupting the flow for most readers.
* Edit 5: I'll try putting this chunk and the last chunk of text that I deleted into Notes, to see how putting them into Notes work for you. They are obviously matters that are important to you. 
::{{tq|I prefer the "Pythagoras" to "The complete form", because it gives a reason (I like to hammer on), and it strengthens the relation to coordinate values. (less wordy?)}}
::: How about "an expanded form"? "Pythagorean" is confusing because of the minus sign, and I'm not sure I want to spend the time to explain '''here''' its significance. It is certainly an important topic, but I don't want to digress too much. Maybe expand the note? 
* Edit 6: I like the overset def. I presume this is a standard form in the math literature?
::{{tq|It is one of the notations I have seen, I prefer it to the \equiv for the latter's many other meanings, I myself used the ":{{=}}" which is deprecated in WP, I think for the computer scientists sake. However, I think it is not appropriate at the second occurrence. It is a def the first time ("along a straight line"!), then it is just a consistent repetition in a detailed section.}}

== Latest suggestion ==

{{Talkquote|In pre-relativistic physics, measured distances (<math>\Delta x</math>) and time lapses (<math>\Delta t</math>) between events were assumed to be independent invariants, and there were just, then only recently, emerging ideas that these measurements could change when taken in another frame.

Rationale:
*Making <math>\Delta x</math> and <math>\Delta t</math> explicit makes it easier to hint to the special feature of "minus"(!) in the Minkowski metric. I think this remains hard enough to keep in mind when looking at spacetime diagrams, when the "obvious sum" of two triangle sides is "shorter" than the "longest" side. Furthermore, I believe reasons to assume non-invariance did emerge then. 
*Recalculating the Euclidean "unique linear spatial distance" via "Pythagoras" is no "re-definition", superseding the previous one. I inserted the parens and exchanged the "-"s for making Pythagoras more obvious. I settle on agreeing on disagreement.

Mentioning asides: Shouldn't [[Special relativity#How far can one travel from the Earth?|this section]] be moved up to Consequences ..., too. More distant: I was very proud about me writing in the lead the "causing - caused" play on words, because I hoped someone were reminded of Wheeler's "how to move - how to curve", but I fully understand that it might not be good English. :) Sorry, [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy]] ([[User talk:Purgy Purgatorio|talk]]) 11:04, 11 November 2018 (UTC)

: Much improved! You've bypassed my objections to <math>\Delta x^2</math> and <math>\Delta t^2</math>, but I still think it is a bit verbose and overly coy in hinting at (but not actually describing) the "emerging ideas" (i.e. Lorentz, Poincaré). Let me re-read some relevant chapters in Arthur I. Miller's ''Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity: Emergence (1905) and Early Interpretation (1905-1911)'' before responding.

OK, how about this? There is absolutely no need to ''(hint, hint)'' at the "emerging ideas that these measurements could change when taken in another frame" since those ideas had already been quickly suggested in the Introduction, and a link to [[History of special relativity]] had been provided.
{{Talkquote|In pre-relativistic physics, measured distances (<math>\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z</math>) and time lapses (<math>\Delta t</math>) between events were assumed to be independent invariants. In special relativity, the intrinsic interweaving of spatial and temporal coordinates fundamentally destroys these separate invariances, supported from everyday life, leaving just the ''difference'' of the squared time lapse and the summed squares of the spatial quantities, denoted as <math>\Delta s^2</math>, as invariant:

For simplified scenarios such as in the analysis of spacetime diagrams, a reduced-dimensionality form of the invariant interval is often employed:

:Only because you asked for it explicitly:
:Omitting the (hint, hint) is fine if hinting was already done (note the "are" in the text now); Euclidean metric (= Pythagoras = SUM of squares) is well known, but I would avoid mentioning Pythagoras, when the spacetime metric (= DIFF of squares) is addressed nearby. How about renaming the first occurrence of <math>\Delta x</math> to <math>\Delta r</math>? I simply like the ultimately terse definition of the spacetime metric, in contrast to the Euclidean metric, as the difference of <math>c^2\Delta t^2</math> and <math>\Delta r^2</math> much better than the one with a boring list of components (x,y,z). Orthogonal decomposition of a strictly 1-dim property into three components is no rocket science. Stripped by all refs, and cramming in some wild beasts to put into footnotes or to annihilate totally, this would look like:

{{Talkquote|In pre-relativistic physics, measured distances (<math>\Delta r</math>) and time lapses (<math>\Delta t</math>) between events are independent invariants. In special relativity, the intrinsic interweaving of spatial and temporal coordinates radically destroys these separate invariances, supported by everyday life experience; just the ''difference'' of the squared time lapse and the squared spatial distance, denoted as <math>\Delta s^2</math>, remains as the ''invariant spacetime interval'', demonstrating a fundamental discrepancy between Euclidean and spacetime distances.

:<math> \Delta s^2 \; \overset{def}{=} \; c^2 \Delta t^2 - \Delta r^2.</math>

In three spatial dimensions <math>\Delta r^2</math> can be expanded, according to Pythagoras' theorem, to

:<math> \Delta s^2 = c^2 \Delta t^2 - (\Delta x^2  + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2),</math>

but in simplified 1-dimensional scenarios, as in the analysis of spacetime diagrams, the reduced-dimensionality form from above is often employed.

The invariance of the quantity <math>\Delta s^2</math> is a property of the general Lorentz transform (also [[Poincaré transformation]]), making it an [[isometry]] of spacetime. The general Lorentz transform between ''any'' two Cartesian inertial frames covers, in extension to the standard Lorentz transform, which deals just with translations ([[Lorentz boost]]s) in x-direction, all other [[translation (geometry)|translations]] and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] in space and in time, and also all transformations that keep the origin fixed ([[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]]).

: [https://datayze.com/readability-analyzer.php Objective measures of readability] rank the various revised versions of the section, both yours and mine, about three grade levels more difficult to read than what is currently in place. Now, I believe that the first paragraph in any section needs to be maximally accessible, and the difference in difficulty level between the suggestions offered here and what is in place is quite dramatic. As I've stated before, a successful compromise leaves '''neither''' person completely happy. I will push as much as I can of your suggestions into main article space to achieve the additional precision of expression that you desire, but I insist on the readability of the first paragraph.

::Who were I, if I dared to discuss the readability of my English babbling? <small>There is just a faint doubt about the feasibility of "deep learned" programs significantly judging roughly five(!) sentences for their readability.</small> I myself wrote about me ''cramming in'' topics I consider interesting for a reader passing by (sometimes with the intent to trivialize high brow lingo). I really feel honored by any small phrase of mine that makes it into an accepted version. I see my cramming in as just offering on topic window shopping for things I find didactically valuable and generally interesting.
::Besides being quite satisfied as it stands, there is just this

::that I do not understand. The latter version easily focuses on the important NEW temporo-spatial metric (with its ''minus''), emphasizes the one-dimensionality of distance and is way shorter and therefore way more clearly laid out. I am convinced that the embedding of one-dimensional spatial distances in 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces via Pythagoras as

== Next steps ==

=== New sections under consideration ===

After adding the section on [[Special relativity#Graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation|Graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation]], it became possible for me to move [[Special relativity#Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light|Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light]] from where it had been stuck to a more rational location in the article, and then to fence off the old legacy sections behind a "Warning! There be lions and tigers and bears (oh my) beyond this point!" sign.

There is obviously a lot left to be done. Optical effects ought to include relativistic aberration and maybe the Fizeau experiment??? Dynamics, of course, covers force, energy and momentum, collisions, and relativistic mass (and why the majority of physicists consider it to be a deprecated concept). Relativistic mass is a concept that most lay persons have heard about, and I'm sure that many visitors to this article page have been disappointed not seeing any mention of it. 

I'm hoping that my reorganization should make it easier to add these additional topics. [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 09:33, 11 November 2018 (UTC)

: Hmmm... it looks like I need to cover the magnet and conductor thought experiment as a preparatory step before covering relativistic aberration. [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 06:48, 18 November 2018 (UTC)

=== Should experimental results be blended with the main narrative or kept separate? ===

Currently, almost all discussion of the experimental justification for SR is sequestered in the [[Special relativity#Status|Status]] section, not that there is very much of it.

Is this a desirable organization? [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 20:49, 14 November 2018 (UTC)

* I had written the following:
:: In pre-relativistic physics, distance and time were considered to be independent measurements, and despite some puzzling experimental results, physicists had no inclination to believe that measured distance or time between events should change as a result of a shift in frame from which measurements are made.
* You commented, "distance between events DOES change in prerelativistic physics as a result of a change in the reference frame, unless the time of the events is the same" and changed the wording to the following:
:: In pre-relativistic physics, distance and time were considered to be independent measurements, and despite some puzzling experimental results, physicists had no inclination to believe that measured time between events should change as a result of a shift in frame from which measurements are made. 
* Pre-relativistic views of length contraction and time dilation are rather complex to describe, and my initial phrasing was an (apparently futile) attempt to avoid going into extensive discussion of Lorentz's and Poincaré's speculations.  I propose the following revision with notes and references:

*You are over-thinking this. I was not talking about length contraction or any such thing. The sentence which I changed said "... measured distance or time between <u>events</u> should change as a result of a shift in frame ..." (emphasis added). Before special relativity, we had [[Galilean relativity]] according to which the transformation law for frames of reference was:
::<math>\begin{align}
t' &= t \\
x' &= x - v t \\
y' &= y \\
z' &= z ,
\end{align}</math>.
:The "&minus; ''v t''" term means that the location of an event depends on the time that its position is measured. So if you subtract two such locations to get the ''x''-component of the distance, you will get a value which depends on the times of the events. That is my whole point.

Impressed by Lorentz's "most ingenious idea", Poincaré saw more in local time than a mere mathematical trick. It represented the actual time that would be shown on a moving observer's clocks. On the other hand, Poincaré did not consider this measured time to be the "true time" that would be exhibited by clocks at rest in the aether. Poincaré made no attempt to redefine the concepts of space and time. To Poincaré, Lorentz transformation described the ''apparent'' states of the field for a moving observer.

:*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Special_relativity&diff=869186596&oldid=869159289 This edit] rephrased the footnote defining "length" as a prima vista triviality. A prominent intent in me writing a "bulky" definition for this everyday notion was to introduce the notion of events in their fundamental role of establishing "length", the value of which will turn out as varying from frame to frame, because of varying coordinates of these events. I think the [[ladder paradox]] is directly connected here, and a caveat of carrying forward a sloppy notion of length into the realm of STR is appropriate.

:::  I know what you ''meant'', but I found your original wording confusing. "In a spacetime setting the length of a rigid object is defined by the spatial distance of the two events made up of the ends of this object at the same time." The ends of the object are not events, but follow world lines. So you intended that the length of the object should mean the spatial distance between two events,  having the same time coordinates, selected from the world lines of the two ends. This spatial distance would, in general, be less than the length measured in the rest frame of the object (i.e. its proper length). In the rest frame of the object, however, it is not at all necessary that the selected events have the same time coordinate. 
::: All this amounts to a lot of superfluous detail, especially in a footnote for the Galilean scenario for which length is an invariant. [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 13:45, 17 November 2018 (UTC)

::::To me an end of an object at some point in time makes up a perfect event ("two events made up of the ends of this object at the same time"), and varying time traces out a world line, which is a certain collection of events; and I perceive no problem with getting acquainted to the notion of a time-varying lenght, as observed from different frames, never getting longer than some distinguished length, one might call a proper length. I do not know how fruitful it is to continue measuring lengths at different times, which only works in the rest frame of the object, and I expressed my doubts about leaving the notion of length in its "trivial" setting of Galileian spacetime.

::::I did not suggest a footnote pertaining to the Galileian notion of length, but a footnote to a sustainable notion of length in general, and to focus the attention to the upcoming change in the notion of length. I think the method of "how to measure length" should not be changed/restricted during migration to STR, and thus I am unaware of a "lot of superfluous detail", however, I consider a footnote, missing to warn about the upcoming subtleties, to be really superfluous.

:I am afraid of being misunderstood. I never wanted to state that the footnote, as is stands now, were ''trivial''. I want to express my perception that its current formulation lacks emphasis on the changing settings in Galilean and -say- Einsteinian spacetime. To my taste, it evokes a ''prima vista''(=sometimes wrong!)-impression of not being that fundamental as it is, by putting a condition, generating the decisive difference, into a small appendix of the sentence. My pleadings just ask for more emphasis on the change, suggesting the use of the words "define" and "event". There is absolutely no need, for a statement to be correct, of conforming to my taste.

== Re recent edits ==

Re recent edits:
*Time dilation: To me it was important to hint to the "lifetime" of muons as an "expectation value", to contrast "high"- and "low"-speed muons, to emphasize "equality" in the respective rest frames, and, maybe not so important, to introduce "proper time". All four items negligible?
*Composition of velocities: I protest. It's about "transformations" of velocities to other frames: u to u'. The LT primarily transform coordinates, their "differential form" is unexplained jargon, the ubiquitous use of the word "addition of velocities" for this situation is abuse of language, be it widespread as it might. "Adding" velocities, as measured in different frames, is a categorical flaw, and each velocity measured in one frame, necessarily introduces another frame: the rest frame of the measured body. This is a delicate topic.
*Standard configuration: This, imho, had no encyclopedic value at all, if it were not for its necessity in introducing Minkowski diagrams, so I do not really understand the perceived emphasis put on it. My personal preference is to start with showing the boost-equations in (1+1) dimensions, generalize to (1+3) dimensions in matrix notation, and reduce the matrix again to "standard configuration". Maybe this would pay the rent in presenting the Thomas rotation, the transversal Doppler effect, ... Summing it up, I think from an encyclopedic POV it is more seminal to introduce the (3+1)-LT with β and γ, and stuff its matrix with 0s, than to put a priori importance on a "standard configuration", simply gained and well defined by these 0s.  
*Two postulates: I do not understand the emphasis on this, too. It would be my first concern to derive from clunky postulates some most handy equations to proceed with the development of a closed theory. So why should any researcher resort to the ''postulates'', if it were not for writing a bestseller (... ''any single formula in a book reduces the paid circulation by'' ... (unknown source)). Isn't this unencyclopedic, a la textbook? ;)
*<small>Apologies for my off topic curiosity: I know about the constructs of gerunds and infinitives, and I learned back then that "allow" could be used with both constructs (in contrast to "allow for", which is only to be used with the gerund). Was this wrong all the time, has it changed some time in between, or is it a matter of taste? Ignore, if bothering. Thanks. </small>

=== Time Dilation ===
==== Before ====
Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the (expected) lifetime of a [[muon]] that starts to exist with a collision of a cosmic ray with a particle of the Earth's atmosphere, then moves at very high speed towards the surface, and decays near there, is measured as greater than the lifetimes of slowly moving muons, generated and decaying in a laboratory. Both muons would, of course, measure identical lifetimes, when looking at their respective wrist watches, and both observe the other as moving, and the moving watch as ticking slower than their own, which is said to show the [[proper time]], as measured by an observer (at rest in its frame).
==== After ====
Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the lifetime of high speed [[muon]]s created by the collision of cosmic rays with particles in the Earth's outer atmosphere and moving towards the surface is greater than the lifetime of slowly moving muons, created and decaying in a laboratory.
==== Commentary ====
Both [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] and I worked on this one. We halved the number of words and simplified sentence structure. Measuring "(expected) lifetime of a muon" is easily misread from what you apparently intended.
=== Dragging effects ===
Rindler states, on page 54 of his textbook, "From the point of view of special relativity, however, the result '''(3.1)''' is nothing but the relativistic velocity addition formula!" He doesn't even use the word "composition." All of the "delicate" nuances that you insist on should already be implied and understood from previous explication of the relativistic composition of velocities, and should not clutter discussion of dragging effects.

=== Standard configuration ===
Shorthand expression "standard configuration" reduces a lot of verbiage. The expression is repeatedly used not just in my writing, but in the legacy "[[Special relativity#Technical discussion of spacetime|Technical discussion of spacetime]]" section containing material that I judged to be beyond freshman-sophomore mathematics level. If you wish to ''start with showing the boost-equations in (1+1) dimensions, generalize to (1+3) dimensions in matrix notation, and reduce the matrix again to "standard configuration" etc. etc. '', then you should draft a section for the technical section. It's there for a reason. It sounds to me like your proposal could be a great addition.
=== Two postulates ===
You appear to misunderstand my rewording of the section titles. Historically, this article appears to have been written by two camps of editors, a group of "two-postulates" advocates, and a group of "single postulate of Lorentz invariance" advocates. When I started my series of edits, the article was a mishmash of contributions by the two groups, and was '''very''' confusing to me, until I understood the historical development of this article. I am a "packrat" and ''do not like throwing out material.'' Rather than delete legacy "two-postulates" material, what I am ''trying'' to say with my rewording of the section titles is: <span style="color:darkred">''Traditionally, special relativity has been presented in terms of Einstein's two postulates. This article does not follow this old tradition, but instead presents special relativity using the single postulate of Lorentz invariance.''</span>
=== Use of "allow" ===
You are referring, I presume, to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special_relativity&diff=next&oldid=870140522 this edit.] "Allow to deal with" is wrong, and this wrongness is not a matter of taste. You can write, "allow one to deal with" or "allow dealing with". 
=== General comment ===
Please use diffs to pinpoint problematical edits. Otherwise you force me to do a '''lot''' of research to pinpoint the exact phrase that you have having issues with. [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 12:28, 24 November 2018 (UTC)

===Purgy's reply===
Thanks for the grammar, apologies for missing links, Roma locuta, ... We are the faithful. Nevertheless, a few remarks:
 
- no ''high speed'' muons, no ''equal'' lifetime in ''specific frames''?

- I did not refer at all to "Dragging effects", I experience the content of [[Special relativity#Composition of velocities|this section]] as ''delicate''. I seriously protest against calling the "transformation" of a velocity from one frame to another frame an "addition", not even a composition, just because the transformation in the Galilean transform is represented by an addition. Velocities are ''never added'', the are ''transformed'' in a Galilean setting by simply adding a quantity, which is characteristic for the transformation, and necessarily must be of equal dimension <math>Ls^{-1},</math> and in a more complex way in STR spacetime. Of course, the transformation, as all LT do, involves a velocity, but I would avoid calling this even a ''composition''. As usual: just to let you know.

- ''I would prefer not to.'' Bartleby's English is not firm enough to compose a full section.

- Obviously I am not sufficiently sensitive to experience the nuances of the two sources, or I was trained to ignore all postulate driven derivations after having seen the derivation of the full blown LT from first principles, presented by a real Grandmaster of the Chalk (sort of a W. Lewin, if this is allowed to state wrt lecture quality).

Never would I simply revert [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special_relativity&curid=26962&diff=876667739&oldid=876648900 this edit,] but ...

To me the above conclusion in the last step is immediate/obvious/..., but I see no reasoning that to achieve an inverse of a Lorentz transform
:- ''primed and unprimed symbols are interchanged'' and a parameter is ''replaced by its negative'',

(both recipes only motivated by the structure of two formulae?), but rather this is ''coherently'' done by
:- performing an appropriate Lorentz transform (from all primed to unprimed), and then
:- substituting the derived parameter identity.

BTW, my ''editorializing'' term of  velocities being ''incoherent'', if they belong to different frames, is based on the fact that in the inverse Lorentz transformation the parameter velocity and the transformed velocity are derivatives with respect to a ''different'' time. This reservation also holds for transforming simple coordinates. Validity of any ''replacements'' must be justified for each installment.

== Article Bloat ==

Read through the article last night, so you could say I slept on it. Anyway.. my problem with this article is it's bloated, and also a poor intro for anybody who doesn't already understand SR. The "motivation" is way too long (1 page+ on an intro to what's essentially a simple and elegant theory), the "compatibility" is a huge list of bullet points (would the average reader really be interested in so many examples?) and my biggest problem is... no train/mirror example!? I did physics a while ago and more or less got my head around SR when my teacher explained it because she was a good teacher. I then read up on it again much later in a pop sci book, and only then came across the train/mirror example.

I was amazed at how intuitive it presented SR as, and feel this example (or one very much like it) should really be in this article, perhaps even as the first section - an introduction of WHAT SR IS. This article has lots of great info - it's very in depth - but it somehow gets lost in the detail I feel. While generally I recommend wikipedia as the source of most knowledge, if it came to recommending a good page to read about SR to friends who aren't physics buffs, I don't think I'd point them to this page.

Finally, "This page is 81 kilobytes long" - the discussion page needs some fat trimming off it too :)

Anyway, a fair bit of criticism there, hope I haven't stepped on anyone's toes and I apologise if I have - my only intention is to try and provide constructive crit. as to how this article could be improved and a theory that must surely be immensely thought provoking and interesting to the general public be accessible to them. That's what Wikipedia is all about, right?

== Prologue ==

[[:Tom Van Flandern|Tom Van Flandern]] argues that the [[:Lorentz Relativity|Lorentz Relativity]] theory, the primary competitor to
[[special relativity]], does a better job of explaining the [[:Speed of gravity|Speed of gravity]], and is suppored by all the existing experimental evidence that supports special relativity.

There are a hundred and three alternatives to special relativity, and next to noone takes them seriously.  Discussion of the particular alternatives definitely does not belong on a main page like special relativity, any more than discussion of Velikovsky belongs on history or discussion of Nostradamus belongs on theology.
----
While Josh Grosse may feel this way, I'd like him to at least name five of these hundred and three alternatives that are known to fit all the existing experimental evidence.  I have my doubts that they exist, based on what I have read about physics. Having read Tom Van Flandern's article, I think Ben was right in putting this note in the article on special relativity.  (hmm. maybe I should let Ben fight his own battles though...)

Ok, so I was a little quick to judge, and I apologize.  On a careful reading Flandern is indeed working with standard Lorentz ether theory, something which gives the same results as special relativity and so can't be dismissed experimentally, yet which physicists ''continually'' reject anyways (having talked to some).  The reason is that it is essentially SR plus the concept of a preferred frame, and yet the symmetries in the equation make this frame indistinguishable from the others.  Flandern argues that the gravitational field established a preferred frame, but this is no different than saying the observer establishes a preferred frame - it is not in fact a difficulty with frame equivalence.  The gravitational field doesn't transform properly in SR, of course, but that is because SR is the gravityless case of general relativity, where there is no preferred frame.  But this is beside the point.  Flandern's work is not a mainstream position, nor is it a noteable competitor to the mainstream position except in so far as it is a particular argument for Lorentz ether theory, and there are plenty of others - for instance, the supposition that an ether is in fact falsifiable because it places strong constraints on spatial topology.  I think it might be worth discussing on a page about ether theory or about Flandern, but it isn't really that relevant to SR in particular.

I've removed the following from the article:

:(Asterisk)* To postulate means that one supposes that what one has postulated could happen in nature; Einstein supposedly postulated one-way, two-clock light speed isotropy and invariance; however, since such a speed calls not only for two clocks, but for two synchronized clocks, and since nature cannot synchronize clocks, there cannot be any such speed, so there cannot be any scientific postulate calling for its isotropy and invariance. Proof: The one-way, two-clock light speed measurement has never been made because it cannot be made. (The above note was added by Brian D. Jones bdj@access-4-free.com Aug-14-2002) 


because it's essentially completely unsupported.  Brian, feel free to put it back in ''if'' you can give a good reason why "nature cannot synchronize clocks" (other than plain assertion, and no, simply stating "X has not been done because X cannot be done" is not proof of anything - if you can show that it's a physical impossibility to make this measurement, please explain how).  Anyway, I really don't understand what you're driving at here.  SR only requires the existence of a time coordinate, not necessarily an actual physical clock. --[[User:Bth|Bth]] 14:17 Aug 14, 2002 (PDT)

B D Jones is happy to reply, as follows:

Here is my simple explanation re the fact that nature cannot possibly synchronize clocks (although, as you will see after this explanation, it is almost too obvious to need any explanation):

Clock synchronization requires three physical operations, none of which can be accomplished by Mother Nature (as will be self-evident). 

Given, two spatially-separated, unstarted clocks, these three operations are as follow:

[1] deciding upon their temporal relationship
:(i.e., devising a definition of synchronization),

and

[2] adjusting their hands/dials in accordance with the definition, 

and

[3] somehow starting the clocks.

Re [1]:
Since Nature has no brain, She obviously cannot possible concoct a clock synchronization procedure.

Re [2]:
Since Nature has no hands (or any other means), She obviously cannot possibly adjust the hands of clocks.

Re [3]:
Since Nature has no brain or hands, She obviously cannot possibly start clocks at the proper moment and in the proper manner (i.e., in accordance with some clock synchronization procedure).

Clearly, only man can synchronize clocks.

However, it is just as clear that '''all''' two-clock measurements are dependent upon how the clocks are synchronized. Indeed, no two-clock measurement can be made unless the clocks have been synchronized somehow.

Therefore, it is impossible to measure light's one-way, two-clock speed without clock synchronization, and the result is dependent upon the given synchronization. 

Clearly, only if Nature Herself has synchronized the clocks can the result of any two-clock measurement be a natural result.

The Special Theory of Relativity was constructed to explain earlier experiment results, and the most significant of them was the Michelson-Morley experiment. However M-M experiment was performed in air, giving the famous null result. But SR uses speed of light in vacuum in its postulate, so it can't explain at all M-M experiment (because the theory can not be derived using the speed of light in air).

So let's take a closer look to the M-M experiment and consider it performed using following mediums where light propagates:

(i) vacuum (speed of light is 299 792 458 m/s)
(ii) air (speed of light is 299 702 547 m/s)
(iii) water (speed of light is 225 407 863 m/s)

(iv) consider also the experiment performed using electrons instead of photons, travelling much lower speed (say 100 m/s)

It is quite well known that (i) produces null result. In 1887 Michelson concluded null result from (ii) with then known methods, but what is result got now? If M-M experiment supports SR, (ii) shall produce non null result. Also (iii) shall produce unambigious non null result, because of bigger speed different. But it is quite clear, that (iv) produces null result. So, which speeds of information carriers in medium produce null result and which not?

In fact, if (ii) and (iii) produce null result, this contradicts SR.

What's that bit about cellular automata in aid of? It's not relevant at all. -- [[User:CYD|CYD]]
----
Cellular automata: I put that section in, so I take responsibility for it.  It's there for pedagogical purposes.  It is completely relevant.  In contrast to pretentious intellectual babble, it actually ''transmits information'', which is exactly what language is for, last I checked.  Cellular automata is a paradigm that is perfectly appropriate for special relativity.  The point of using it is to ''get the point across''(i.e. educate).  So long as it helps build the appropriate neural pathways, it is completely relevant, for if the criteria for relevance stood independant of such a goal, the 'relevant' material would be doomed to meaninglessness.  -- [[User:kevin_baas|Kevin Baas]]

:It doesn't ''get the point across'' to me. Perhaps you could elaborate? In fact that whole section, starting from "Geometrically", seems suspect to me. "All 'points' along the null dual-cone represent the same point in space-time" - say what? -- [[User:DrBob|DrBob]] 16:50 Apr 30, 2003 (UTC)

The idea that all points on the cone are the same simply because the interval between them is zero is incorrect.  Pseudometrics don't work the same as metrics, and you can see this by noting that there are points with non-zero separation that both have zero separation from some appropriate third point.

As I understand it, Kevin, what you are trying to communicate with the reference to CAs is that the structure of SR is local, i.e. repeated at every point.  But they really don't have much in common - space-time is neither cellular nor has any of the properties of automata associated with it.  I think it suggests far more that is not true than it does that is true.  ''Surely'' if the point is so important there is some other way to state it?
----
DrBob-I refer you to [[tensors]], and [[null geodesics]].  You should also study [[special relativity]], ofcourse.  The classical text on tensor calculus, which includes a decent( thou small and partial) section on special relativity., is Synge's "Tensor Calculus".  What I mean by that specific statement is that the measure between any two points on the null geodesic is zero.  [[Minkowski space]], and, in general, Non-Euclidean([[Riemannian geometry]]), does not operate the same way as [[Euclidean geometry]].  If you're still confused, or are too stubborn to reference these materials, you could also read Einstein's own book on special relativity, which is written for the layman.

Regarding intervals:
1. Refer to [[Topology]] regarding the mathematical meaningfullness of a distinction between 'two' points which cannot be distinguished mathematically by any means whatsoever.
2. By a pseudometric I assume you mean a metric on an unorientable manifolds?  I would imagine that if you measure the distance incorrectly the two distances cancel out.  However, if you measure them correctly, you'll see that, according to standard procedure, there is no such thing as a negative distance(measure).  Negative only implies that one is measuring in the opposite direction, or with a complementary orientation.
Furthermore, the proper way to measure distance in Riemannian geometry, is via variational calculus, which produces a ''unique and positive-definite'' result.

Regarding space having local structure: yes, that is what I am trying to say.  But let me quote someone who I think said it more clearly:

"Another radical consequence is the rejection of the notion of an absolute, unique, frame of reference. Previously it had been believed that the universe traveled through a substance known as "aether" (absolute space), against which speeds could be measured. However, the results of various experiments, culminating in the famous Michelson-Morley experiment, suggested that either the Earth was always stationary (which is absurd), or the notion of an absolute frame of reference was mistaken and must be discarded."

Try to figure out where I took that quote from.

The speed of light is the same in every inertial reference frame. An inertial reference frame is a 'cell'. I think the analogy is pretty obvious and simple.  The implication is [[simultaneity]].

--[[User:kevin baas|Kevin Baas]] 2004.05.01

Kevin, no.

A pseudometric is like a metric, but it is ''not'' positive-definite, and as a result various properties cease to hold.  The Minkowski metric falls into this category.  Thus, for instance, there are two completely different sorts of non-zero intervals, ones where ds<sup>2</sup> is positive ''and'' ones where it is negative.  These correspond to the interior and the exterior of the cone, and are completely distinct, not just different in orientation.  Also, the points on the cone can't be identified just because they have zero interval between them.

A simple thought experiment should confirm this.  At event A, I send out a pulse of light.  At event B, it is reflected by a mirror.  At event C, I receive it again.  Obviously if events A and C are distinct, then ''at least'' one must distinct from event B - but they are both connected to event B by null geodesics.  Really, though, a decent treatment of Minkowski space should explain such things.  Your assumption that the people who disagree with you simply haven't had enough exposure to Riemannian geometry is, I can assure you, false.

As for the cells, the analogy is badly stretched.  A frame of reference in relativity is a local coordinate system, describing some neighborhood of a point.  A cell in a cellular automaton is a particular structure associated with a point, i.e. an automaton whose inputs are the states in the neighboring cells.  I think the comparison is more misleading than enlightening.
----
Assuming one considers 'automaton' a valid philosophical construction.  Insofar as the validity of an 'automaton' is a stretch, I concede that the analogy is a stretch.  However, putting aside the false sentiment of a 'thing-in-itself' implied by an 'automaton', i mantain that insofar as SR implies that ''information propagates'' at the speed of light, the -t half-plane of minkowski space can be considered the 'input' or the past which is observable from thereference frame, and the 'output' of the reference frame is that which is in the -t half-plane of all other referencee frames, which is by inverse relation in the +t half plane of the reference frame.  Again, I am not stating that an object or event at any point 'exists' in a reference frame, or even that such a proposition would be meaningfull.

In your thought experiment, event A, B, and C are clearly distinct because the origins of the null geodesics that you used in your model are clearly distinct.(for instance, on frame A, the origin of frame C is at t=k(and does ''not'' lie on a null geodesic), where k is nonzero) Ofcourse, the fact that they are local Minkowski spaces is shared by all three.

I concede that A and B are connected via a null geodesic, and that B and C are -- in fact, I do not need to concede that because it is ''my point''.

Ofcourse, SR is not cellular because it is not discrete, and insofar as a cell is a 'structure' I concede that the analogy is stretched, ect..  But that's just what an analogy is: an exposition of the likeness of two entities which are not exactly similiar.  What I mean to imply by the analogy is purely and simply the intuitive spatio-temporal geometry, which I think would be the primary concept that would be carried over by the association.  If you can find a more fitting analogy  that enables higher-level thinking and is appropriate to an audience that is not already familiar with the subtleties of SR, then I'm all for it.  But I think you're overstating the dangers of sacrificing a few subtleties for a clear, accessible,  and concept-building presentation.

btw, forgive me for my patronizing.  it was inappropriate.  i had a bad day. :(.

--[[User:kevin baas|Kevin Baas]] 2004.05.01

Ok, I don't see what it is you are trying to say about null geodesics.  The article says that all points along the "null dual-cone" are actually the same point.  That should identify B with A, and C with B, since they are connected by light paths.  But here you say you aren't doing that.  So what are you doing?  I must be misunderstanding the comment from the article, then.

As for the analogy, I think that if I missed the point, CYD missed the point, and DrBob missed the point, then the point can't be that obvious.  You have done a good job explaining what is meant here on the Talk page, I'll see if I can transport some of that to the article.
----
Cool.  I am not a miser with my words.  The main point of me writting that section was for there to be such a section: a clear and generally accessible section which develops a basic geometric understanding of SR.

Perhaps the misunderstanding came from this "point".  I did not mean that the null geodesic represented the same point in a global reference frame, or so called 'space'; aether (for, as the theory states, one cannot be validly constructed), but rather that it was the same point within the local reference frame, according to it's ''intrinsic'' geometry, in much the same way that (1,0) and (1,2*pi) are the same point in a polar coordinate system.

I agree that if three people missed the point to the extent that they made a point of that fact, then it is evident that the(my) presentation is not effectively communicating the point.  I would like to see it more clearly presented.

Add theory number 104 - Wisp Unification Theory - to the alternatives to SR. It produces a general Doppler equation set that is fundamentally different to Einstein's, and yet when a limit process is added it produces all of SR's equation and matches or betters its experimental predictions.
I have opened up a "one-way light speed test" discussion on the metaresearch site at www.metaresearch.org/msgboard/ >genral matters>meta science>SR & one-way light speed tests.
I am a firm believer that a simple Earth based one-way test using two clocks will prove SR wrong. But I do not support the concept of a local gravitational field to explain matters. My theory is based purely on commonsense principles and is available free from http://www.kevin.harkess.btinternet.co.uk

It should be <math>E_{0} = m c^{2}</math> and not <math>E = m c^{2}</math>,
i.e. the energy in the rest frame (energy depends on the frame of reference)
equals mass (this is independent on the frame of reference) times velocity
of light squared. But it would make necessary to change a lot more than that.
----
Ok, this is a really long page already and I'll confess not having read the abode. If BDJ wants to give us all permission to pare it down that would be good. Anyway, I have a point to make.

The [[Michelson-Morley_experiment]] seems to prove that accelerating in one direction has no more effect on one's time flow rate than accelerating in another direction would. In other words, to accelerate away from earth towards Alpha Centauri would not affect one's timeflow experience any more than accelerating at the same rate in the opposite direction.

However, I see an exception made here when it is said that a person accelerating towards Alpha Centauri would experience a reduction in time flow rate (age more slowly, think more slowly, etc.), but upon decelleration he would "normalize" back to experiencing time the same as any other "stationary" person would. In other words, time goes at the same rate for a star-traveler once he returns to earth and stops as it did when he left.

Now is that reasonable? Does it add up? The guy was slowed by accelerating and speeded back up for decellerating. Why? Is there a difference between acceleration and decelleration? I thought it was just exactly the same thing in different directions.

And another thing. If acceleration is different from gravity, as the [[twins paradox]] article states, that would mean that persons living in a centrifuge would live at a different rate from someone standing on the surface of a planet. A centrifuge (or rotating space colony) produces counterbalancing acceleration and decelleration constantly. And yet, you can hardly say the person isn't moving. Is he experiencing time at a slower rate at one side of the station than the other?

If you take a rabbit and a few carrots, attach synchronized clocks to the rabbit and the carrots, put the rabbit on a catapult capable of launching the rabbit in a random direction at 97.3% of the speed of light, launch the catapult with rabbit into space, at the same time launch the carrots into space in random directions, using a remote control set the catapult to launch the rabbit, wait for the rabbit to smell, locate and eat the carrots, the clocks on each carrot should appear to have been running faster than the rabbit's clock, at the time the rabbit eats each carrot.

In the motivation part for theory it is said: "For example, one may observe no magnetic field, yet another observes a magnetic field in the same physical area". I can't see any connection between this statement and the need for SR. On the other hand, there is no other motivations mentioned. So why was SR needed in 1905?

- TS

:By "motivation", I don't think it is meant "purpose of".  One does not say, "we need or should have x for the practical reasons of y", and then develop x.
:Rather, by motivation, esp. in regard to scientfic theoretical motivation, it is something which points out an insufficiency in the current theory.  The theory at the time demonstrate that what was mentioned should not happen; that, rather, the same magnetic field should be observed regardless of the observer.  SR then remedied this problem.  It motivated SR in so far as it suggested a problem that needed to be solved, and SR was, at least in part, created out of an attempt to solve this problem, which is succeeded in.  In any case, SR is a "solution", and solutions cannot exist without "problems". -[[User:Kevin_baas|Kevin Baas]] 2004.01.08

== What does the term 'mass' mean? ==

Sometime in the last couple of months or so, someone added:

'''As the velocity of an object increases, so does its mass, and the increase in mass is equal to 1/c2 times the increase in energy. I.e.  E = mc2'''

This is wrong, or at least isn't consistent with how SR is currently taught (there's an older formulation of SR, which uses a different definition of mass, in which this is true - see [[rest mass]]). The trouble is, this is such a "well known fact" that people keep adding it to the article

Probably the article needs a description of the both formulations to prevent this happening. Anyone feel up to it? -- [[User:DrBob|DrBob]] 01:37, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I've written an article at [[relativistic mass]] that discusses this matter in detail. I will try to clean up the usage of mass in this article as well. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 21:42, 2004 Mar 19 (UTC)

Hmm. I haven't studied physics at University for some time now, but I don't believe that the term 'rest mass' has been deprecated. Physicists are often sloppy with terms and say 'mass' when they mean 'rest mass' etc, but that is because they expect you to know what they are talking about. Similarly mass & energy are separate concepts - they are not the same thing, but in some situations are sloppily treated as if they were. I think in this case (many of our readers are not expert physicists), it make sense to be careful with terms.

I think that the historical treatment of SR really has outlived it's usefulness. Why are we still talking about a 25 year wrong turn? Concepts like Aether can only confuse (and attract cranks). It would be nice just to get rid of the reference to Aether, Lorentz etc and move it to 'History of Relativity' or such-like. Do others agree?
[[User:Sokane|Oz]] 04:48, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Certainly it's confusing, which I why I think we should be careful. Especially when different Wikipedia article use "mass" in mutually inconsistant ways. Generally though, "mass" meaning "rest mass" is the standard usage, nowadays. The problem is that popularizations and so forth tend to use the older style.
:I agree that we could downplay the history a bit, perhaps just re-order the sections so that what SR is appears in the article before the history of its development. -- [[User:DrBob|DrBob]] 16:11, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Physicists are most certainly not slopply with the usage of the word ''mass'' in relativity. They know precisely what they mean. In fact, the terms ''rest mass'' and ''relativistic mass'' are virtually unused in modern literature (i.e. the past 60 or so years). For more discussion, see the [[relativistic mass]] article.

Regarding the topic of history: The history of special relativity is an extremely important aspect of the subject and deserves to be discussed somewhere. My preference would be to leave it on this page until it grows too large to be managable. Besides, the "crack pots" will find it no matter where you stick it. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 21:42, 2004 Mar 19 (UTC)

:I don't why know the history is important. The theory stands alone without it. It's also a lot harder to check historical facts for authenticity. Newtonian physics, for example, isn't taught by first teaching incorrect theories as history. Anyway...
:There are 2 concepts of mass: 'rest mass' & 'relavitistic mass'. I trained as a mathematican / phyisicts and I don't think either should be dissignated as THE 'mass'. Physicts use the term in context (THAT is what I meant by sloppy). In QM, mass will probably mean rest mass; In the formula E=mc^2, it means the relativistic mass. In an introductory text on SR, I think it is important to keep the distinction. Once it is appreciated, and the context established, the generic term 'mass' can be used without confusion.

It is true that special relativity stands on its own without regard to its history, but one can gain a much deeper understanding of it by learning how it evolved. The same is true of any physical theory &mdash; including Newtonian mechanics. And contrary to your statement, even Newtonian mechanics is taught by dispelling certain beliefs held by the ancient Greeks. At least, that's how I learned it and its how I continue to teach it.

Actually, most physicists take the ''m'' in E=mc^2 to be the rest mass. This means, of course, that the formula works only in the rest frame. A more general formula, E = &gamma;mc^2 works in all frames. I agree that if this equation were the only issue at hand it would be much nicer to use the relativistic mass. But doing so leads to all sorts of confusions in other places, which is why people don't. Unfortunately, the equation is so well known to non-physicists and so often misinterpreted that it is hard to explain to people how it is really used. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 01:03, 2004 Mar 20 (UTC)

:Of course it does. The equation isn't wrong: It's just a matter of what you choose to call the mass. Is it E/c^2 or is it E/(&gamma;c^2). It turns out the second is more convenient. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 01:36, 2004 Mar 20 (UTC)

:Precisely. This is what I meant, when I said the equation E=mc^2 is only applied in the rest frame (or approximately when velocities are small).

:Let me give an example just to clarify a potential confusion between rest mass and relativistic mass. Everyone "knows" the [[photon]] is massless. If one naively applies the formula E=mc^2 one is led to the incorrect conclusion that a photon has zero energy. It doesn't. Where's the error? It's in using the relativistic mass ''M'' = &gamma; ''m''. Here the rest mass ''m'' equals zero and &gamma; is infinite (since photons travel at the speed of light). But infinity times zero is an [[Indeterminate form|indeterminate quantity]]. Hence the relativistic mass is undefined. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 01:56, 2004 Mar 20 (UTC)

:: Actually E=mc^2 works for all velocities short of c, where m is the relativistic mass. The photon is certainly capable of taking away energy (mass) so I guess this really supports the idea that the mass of the photon should not be equated with it's 'rest mass'. ;-). 
:: Consider a stationary particle A of mass 4, which decays into a photon and a second particle B of rest mass 1 moving near the speed of light. It's relativistic mass is 2. The formula E=mc^2 works just fine if m is regarded as the relativistic mass, but fails if m is limited to mean the rest mass. The photon would take away 2 units of mass, particle B would take away 2 units of mass. I do see how there would be a problem if you interpreted m just to be the rest mass. ;-) [[User:Sokane|Oz]] 03:37, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::As I said, if ''m'' is the rest mass the formula E=mc^2 applies only in the rest frame. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 04:15, 2004 Mar 20 (UTC)

There is some agreement: The term 'mass' can mean 2 things, and the usage depends on what is most convenient for YOU. I would argue that the 'relativistic mass' has a better claim to the term. Why? 

Consider the following (artifical) problem: A 100m long train accelerates up to 0.5 of the speed of light. It approaches a tunnel 90m long. A short, dealy blast of Gamma rays (from an exploding star?) will arrive on earth when the end of the last carriage enters the tunnel. Will the whole train fit in the tunnel at the same time, and be protected from the blast? 

The first step is to calculate it's length at 0.5c. If it is less than 90m, it will fit in the tunnel. The calculated (relativistic) length is the 'real' length since it determines whether some of those on the train live or die. 

You could however argue that term length should only apply to the 'rest length', but those on the train would probably disagree. A similar argument applies to mass.

If your universe revolves around 4-vectors and solving differential equations, then you would never use the 'relativistic mass', or 'relativistic length'. You may regard the problem above as a 'popularisation', but it is good physics. If I was designing a rail gun, I would probably start with simple calculation like those above, and I would not believe complex calculations until I had checked them against the simple calculations.

'Popularisation' are valuable. The anchor theory to intuition. Einstein's famous thought experiments were used for just this purpose.

In many ways, this is a silly argument and only exists because of a faulty claim of uniqueness for the term 'mass'. [[User:Sokane|Oz]] 02:49, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)

* ''Will the whole train fit in the tunnel at the same time, and be protected from the blast?'' my calculations say ''yes''. On the assumption that, ''in the reference frame of the tunnel'' the gamma blast arrives at the same   time at the end and at the start of the tunnel we have three different {\em events} in spacetime: <math>x_0</math> is the event where/when the gamma blast hits the start of the tunnel and the end of the train. <math>x_1</math> the end of the tunnel when the blast arrives, that is 100m and no time afar from <math>x_0</math> in the reference frame of the tunnel, and <math>x_1^'</math> is the place of the head of the train at the time when it leaves the tunnel, that is no time and 90m afar from <math>x_0</math> ''in the reference frame of the train''. <math>x_1^'</math> transformed to the reference frame of the tunnel lies some time in the future of <math>x_1</math> so the head of the train will be still inside the tunnel when the gamma blast arrives at the end of the tunnel.

:''Will the whole train fit in the tunnel at the same time, and be protected from the blast?'' From whose point of view, the guy on the ground or the guy on the train? Rememeber, ''at the same time'' is an observer dependent concept in SR. This is a variation of the classic [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/barn_pole.html Barn and pole paradox]. Of course, who lives and who dies does not depend on what reference frame you're in, or what length you talk about.

:I agree that popularizations are valuable, in general. I would argue, however, that this particular popularization leads to more confusion than enlightenment. One is free to disagree. In the end its not a matter of what I think or what you think is more convenient, its a matter of how the terms are used in the real world. Wikipedia should reflect that. We can and should mention both uses of the word mass, but we should also stick to the most common usage. -- [[User:Fropuff|Fropuff]] 03:19, 2004 Mar 20 (UTC)

Until all reputable physicts use the term mass to mean rest mass, in all situations, it would be misleading to claim that mass just means rest mass.

== The second postulate ==

Hi, I came to be interested in this page after seeing it nominated for Featured Article status. An anonymous user has written in there (presumably the same anon user as 66.147.55.213 above) to say that the second postulate has not been experimentally verified.  He makes a second point about the second postulate having been invalidated: I can see this would be arguable. But regarding the first point, that it has been experimentally verified, that must be established, at least to the satisfaction of reputable scientists. Has it been verified? Does anyone have a reference?  [[User:SlimVirgin|Slim]] 22:02, Dec 9, 2004 (UTC)

: The second postulate is three separate claims:
:#The speed of light is the same to all inertial observers
:#The speed of light is the same in all directions
:#The speed of light does not depend on the velocity of the emitter
:The second claim was verified by the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]s, and the third was verified by the experiments that disproved [[emitter theory]].
:For the third claim, [http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/michelson.html] cites Alvager et al., ''Physics Letters'' '''12''', 260 (1964) as being the definitive study.

What Exactly Are the Implications?

As everyone knows, Einstein said that special relativity (SR) was based on two postulates, known as the first postulate and the second postulate. Since the former (the principle of relativity) does not give or determine any law of physics (but merely says that once a law has been found in one frame, it shall also be found in all others), we see immediately that the latter (the light postulate) is the only definite or specific basis of SR. This, of course, makes the light postulate extremely important as far as SR goes. Indeed, if this postulate were to be experimentally verified, then SR would no longer be a theory, but would instead be a fact. However, it is currently "on the books" as a theory.

The second postulate (aka the light postulate) did not postulate regarding light's round-trip, one-clock speed (as that case was essentially closed in 1887 by experiment); it postulated only in regards to light's one-way speed between two clocks (which must be in the same frame in order to avoid any clock slowing differences).

Therefore, the only way to experimentally test the second postulate is by placing an unstarted clock at each end of a long table, temporally relating them, and then using them to measure light's one-way speed between them.

Despite the fact that the round-trip case was closed decades ago, the just-mentioned one-way case remains open, and any reasonable person would ask Why?

It cannot be due to a lack of the necessary technology because said experiment has not even been done on paper. (I.e., no one has even shown on paper how to measure light's one-way, two-clock speed without first assuming the result. For example, Einstein assumed the result "invariance," and then set the clocks to match his assumed result.)

Just as the round-trip experiment was done sans man's input, so must the one-way experiment be done. Only then can we find the law of nature in the one-way case.

(Man did not manipulate the clock's natural atomic rhythm in the round-trip case; man did not trim or extend the light-path lengths during the round-trip experiment; similarly, man must not dictate the result in the one-way case by presetting the clocks to obtain man's (and not nature's) prechosen one-way light speed "invariance.")

Only if Nature herself can begin with two unstarted clocks and temporally relate them her way can there be a natural value for this speed.

But Nature cannot synchronize clocks because she has no brain to devise a clock synchronization definition, and she has no means of adjusting clock hands in order to implement any such definition.

Therefore, there can be no natural (or Nature-given) value for the one-way speed of light between two clocks. I.e., there can be no one-way light speed experiment. This is the answer to the above-given reasonable question Why has no one even shown on paper how to test the second postulate?

A postulate that cannot be tested is a postulate that cannot be falsified, and a postulate that cannot be falsified is not a scientific postulate.

And since the light postulate is the sole basis of SR, we see that the latter is not a scientific theory.

The Einsteinian transformation equations are the math of SR. These equations cannot exist sans at least two clocks per frame; thus, the equations depend upon Einstein's baseless definition of clock synchronization or his assumption of one-way light speed invariance; therefore, all of the relativistic results of the transformation equations are circular because they were given at the start. For example, if one assumes one-way invariance at the start, and then one sets one's clocks obtain one-way invariance, then one's clock's will obtain one-way invariance. For another example, since Einstein does not have absolute simultaneity, his observers cannot simultaneously pin down or locate the end points of a passing rod, so an incorrect length measurement is made which turns out to be smaller than that of the rod's "rest length." (Similarly, Einstein's "time dilation" and "mass variance" are also merely point-of-view effects caused by Einstein's lack of absolute simultaneity.)

We see that Einstein's "length contraction," "time dilation," and "mass increase" are trivial and of no more importance to space-time physics than is the apparent mutual shrinkage of each of two departing people.

Thus, the full implications of "There are currently no experimental tests of Einstein's second postulate, not even on paper" are "Not only is the second postulate untestable, but special relativity itself is not a scientific theory."

I seriously doubt that Slim envisioned such dire (for SR) ramifications! Cadwgan_Gedrych Dec 13, 2004

::Peter Wolf and Petit Gerard, "Satellite test of special relativity using the global positioning system," ''Phys. Rev. A'' '''56''' (6), 4405-4409 (1997).  Abstract: A test of special relativity has been carried out using data of clock comparisons between hydrogen maser clocks on the ground and cesium and rubidium clocks on board 25 global positioning system (GPS) satellites. The clocks were compared via carrier phase measurements of the GPS signal using geodetic receivers at a number of stations of the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) spread worldwide. In special relativity, synchronization of distant clocks by slow clock transport and by Einstein synchrony (using the transmission of light signals) is equivalent in any inertial frame. A violation of this equivalence can be modeled using the parameter delta c/c, where c is the round-trip speed of light (c=299 792 458 m/s in vacuum) and delta c is the deviation from c of the observed velocity of a light signal traveling one way along a particular spatial direction with the measuring clocks synchronized using slow clock transport. In special relativity delta c/c=0. Experiments can set a limit on the value of delta c/c along a particular spatial direction (henceforth referred to as "direction of delta c"). Within this model our experiment is sensitive to a possible violation of special relativity in any direction of delta c, and on a nonlaboratory scale (baselines >= 20 000 km). The results presented here set an upper limit on the value of delta c/c<5 x 10-9 when considering all spatial directions of delta c and delta c/c<2 x 10-9 for the component in the equatorial plane.

Abstract: Two classes of optical experiments for testing the theory of special relatively are described. One group, typified by the Michelson-Morley experiment, looks for variations in the round-trip speed of light as a function of spatial direction. The second group of experiments measures the relativistic (or second-order) Doppler shift in the transition frequency of fast moving atoms. It is shown how these experiments can benefit from the development of highly stabilized lasers and the advances in superstable high-finesse optical cavities. In addition, it is possible to design novel experiments that are sensitive to possible one-way variations in the speed of light.

:I think I agree with you, though, in the sense that the definition of clock synchronization, and in particular the equivalence between Einstein's light-pulse scheme and any other "reasonable" scheme (in particular, slow clock transport), is arguably more at the heart of special relativity than the more-popular postulates.  (This equivalence is falsifiable, however.)  The Wolf and Gerard paper, above, cites some commentary by Einstein on this subject; maybe I'll get a chance to look it up later this week. [[User:Stevenj|&mdash;Steven G. Johnson]] 05:23, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

Steven, you have changed the rules. The clocks must be in the same frame in order to avoid any possible clock slowing difference. (This eliminates slow clock transport). Also, one cannot use light signals because one must then "preassume" a light speed between the clocks. (This eliminates Einstein synchronization.)  And the optical Doppler shift has nothing to do with a direct, two-clock measurement of light's one-way speed.

:Sorry, I won't play your game.  Some definition of how to relate times at different points in an inertial frame is required in order to describe motion and mechanics.  Light-pulse synchronization is one possibility, and the limit of slow transport of clocks between points in an inertial frame is another.  If the two were inconsistent (which is measurable/falsifiable), that would be a major problem because it would mean that relativity would be inconsistent with our ''non-relativistic'' view of the universe &mdash; in some sense, an implicit postulate of relativity is that the classical picture is correct in the non-relativistic limit.  If the two are consistent then you could object that, in principle, you could come up with a model of physics that changes all clocks by the precise amount needed to match Einstein synchrony even under slow transport (which would not be the same as relativistic time-dilation).  However, I'm not sure if any such model has ever been advanced, and even if it were it might not be falsifiable. [[User:Stevenj|&mdash;Steven G. Johnson]] 15:37, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

Ironically, given that he was the "premier champion" (no disrespect intended) of light speed invariance and isotropy, Einstein himself had to explicitly (mathematically, even) admit that, under certain conditions, light's one-way, two-clock speed would vary with frame velocity. Look at the following:

Quoting Einstein:
"w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have 
:::w = c - v. 
The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c."
:::http://www.bartleby.com/173/7.html 

This math result is still obtainable today on paper, just as it was when Einstein wrote about it. All that one needs are absolutely synchronous clocks instead of Einstein's absolutely asynchronous clocks. 

:You're quoting him out of context &mdash; as far as I can tell, that paragraph is describing the pre-relativity picture of a light pulse traveling next to a train.  A similar example appears in practically every textbook, as a necessary prelude to describing the modified picture in special relativity. [[User:Stevenj|&mdash;Steven G. Johnson]] 15:37, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

Since one cannot prove a negative, Einstein was unable to prove that clocks cannot be absolutely synchronized. He also failed to prove that the principle of relativity (the PR) conflicts with the math result w = c - v. The PR does not call for any specific law of physics; it merely says that '''whatever''' law is found in one frame must also be found in all others. This means that the PR did '''not''' rule out Einstein's c - v, despite Einstein's insistence otherwise.

We must address the second postulate explicitly, and it explicitly states that the '''correct''' '''experimental''' result for light's one-way speed between two clocks in the same frame is invariance/isotropy.

My main points are that since no such experiment exists, not even on paper, there can be no postulating in this case, so the so-called second postulate is not really a scientific postulate, which, in turn, means that special relativity is not a scientific theory.

Thus, the implications persist. The second postulate is not testable because it pertains to a nonexistent (or impossible) "experiment." (The one-way light speed between two same-frame clocks cannot be measured sans man's input for the clock synchronization, but this makes the result artificial (i.e., not from nature), so it is not a law of nature.)

::"Some definition of how to relate times at different points in an inertial frame is required in order to describe motion and mechanics."

:::Of course, Steven, but any ''definition'' of synchronization means that man controls the result in the one-way, two-clock light speed case, and a man-given result is ''not'' a law of nature. (BTW, I don't play games in the case of special relativity.) 

::"You're quoting him out of context — as far as I can tell, that paragraph is describing the pre-relativity picture of a light pulse traveling next to a train. A similar example appears in practically every textbook, as a necessary prelude to describing the modified picture in special relativity."

:::There is no "out of context" problem unless you can prove that Einstein's equation w = c - v is invalid, or, equivalently, prove that Einstein's w = c for all (one-way, two-clock invariance/isotropy) is valid. (Ignore any possible intrinsic clock slowing and intrinsic rod shrinkage.)

:::Furthermore, as I said, the "modified picture in special relativity" was not justified by the facts of the case. To repeat, the principle of relativity does not call for Einstein's one-way light speed invariance between two same-frame clocks. (The principle of relativity does not even apply at all until '''after''' a law has been found, and, as of today, no one has found ''any'' law in the one-way, two-clock light speed case.)

:::Allow me to state the critical problem more specifically: Suppose you are given two unstarted ideal clocks. Suppose you are asked to use them to experimentally measure light's one-way speed. Suppose you are asked to keep them from moving relative to each other in order to avoid any difference due to possible intrinsic clock slowing. How could you conduct the experiment without giving the result at the start by synchronizing the clocks per some man-given definition?

:::(We can all agree that if the clocks are forced via Einstein's definition to obtain invariance, then they will of course obtain invariance, and we should also all agree that if the clocks are absolutely synchronized, then they will not obtain invariance (just as Einstein's w = c - v said), but neither of these results is a law of nature because of man's controlling input at the start.)

:::: Haven't studied physics in about 8 years and I'm very rusty on the scientific method, and this is probably a poor attempt to refute your assertions concerning the circularity issue... but isn't that why we perform statistical analysis on our results? E.g. 'significant difference', and so on. It seems that you're trying to say the movement of the clocks after synchronisation distorts the result of the experiment beyond measure. Wouldn't it be true that since the clocks are moved apart slowly, the time-dilation effect is negligible? Also, if you moved the synchronised clocks apart at the same speed, wouldn't the time-dilation effect on each clock be the same, resulting in them being synchronised after moved apart?

:::: I apologise in advance if this is a stupid answer. I noted your accusation of intellectual cowardice to another user further down the page though and couldn't resist! [[User:Davedx|Davedx]]

:::I think that I will go ahead and cut to the chase instead of waiting for you to try to show that Einstein's w = c - v is invalid by simply presenting my little proof that it is valid, as follows:

:::Let two observers meet in passing as a light ray approaches them.

::: (Oa = Observer A and Ob = Observer B)

:::........Oa
:::......................................<---------light ray
:::........Ob

:::When the two observers briefly meet, they know that the light ray's tip is equidistant from them because they are at a single point in space, and the ray's tip is also at one point in space. We can qualitatively label this distance "X". 

:::After the observers separate, the light ray will reach one of them, as shown below:

:::...Oa
:::............<-----------------------------------light ray
:::...........Ob

:::Since the tip of the light ray cannot be in two places at once, the observers will see it sequentially at absolutely different times. (Here is a down-to-earth example: If I see the real you in both Texas and New York, then this proves that I saw you at absolutely different times because you cannot be in two places at once.) 

:::We can - again purely qualitatively - label the ray's absolutely different arrival times "Ta" and "Tb." (All we care about here is the fact that these times are absolutely different.)

:::The observers can now compare one-way light speeds. (Having no rulers or clocks, they must do this qualitatively.) Here are their extremely simple results:

Oh come on, give me a break, dude; what a fallacy; your assumption of the validity of some silly theory cannot touch my experiment. As I tried to make very clear, I used ''no'' clocks, and I certainly did not use the ''rigged'' clocks of SR (which are forced by definition to find c always, regardless of the reality which was shown by my experiment). (And I would love to know how any SR observers can measure the distance between two points in space.) (Also, I would love to see your proof that when the origins of two passing frames coincide, that their points (x,0,0) do not, although this is of course irrelevant to my experimental proof of one-way variance.)(The only way such distant points would not coincide would be if the physical Lorentz contraction exists, and no relativist would admit to that!)

My counterclaim is that the second postulate has not been experimentally verified, i.e., that no one has ever shown that light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks is invariant or isotropic; and I can easily back up this view of the postulate with a peer-reviewed paper from Einstein himself, as follows:

[quoting Einstein from his 1905 relativity paper]  
 "In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity 
                       2AB/(t'a-ta) = c
 to be a universal constant - the velocity of light in empty space."
       http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/

This brief Einsteinian statement proves that Einstein did not postulate at all regarding light's one-clock, round-trip speed; instead, he merely ''accepted'' round-trip invariance and isotropy as experimental ("In agreement with experience") facts, which, we can all agree, they practically were even in 1887. (However, Einstein was forced to use the word "assume" because the 1887 experiment did not actually cover invariance, but covered only isotropy, but of course invariance was a very safe assumption.)

[again quoting Einstein from his 1905 relativity paper]  
 "1. Any ray of light moves in the 'stationary' system of coordinates 
 with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary 
 or by a moving body. Hence 
                  velocity = light path/time interval
 where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in §1."

Note Einstein's use of coordinate systems. These systems consist of rulers and clocks; therefore, Einstein was talking about light's one-way speed per two clocks in the same frame. (He did not use slow clock transport.)

Furthermore, as I have already pointed out, Einstein himself declared mathematically that under certain circumstances light's one-way, two-clock speed could be c - v. It has been falsely claimed that this was taken out of context, but here is my simple proof to the contrary: 

Despite any and all of the words of Einstein preceding or following his presentation of the simple equation w = c - v, Einstein did in fact ''derive'' that equation; all I ask of those who "yell" Out of context! is that they simply show us Einstein's derivation.

Moreover, there is a peer-reviewed 1992 paper which shows that light's one-way, two-same-frame-clock speed need not be invariant or isotropic. Here is the citation:

'''Elementary relativity with 'everyday' clock synchronization'''
C Leubner, K Aufinger and P Krumm 1992 ''Eur. J. Phys''.''' 13''' 170-177

Finally, I wish to know if anyone, anywhere really believes that Einstein's second postulate does '''not''' pertain to light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks. It should be clear to anyone that this is at least a major part of the Wiki claim, and it is my counterclaim that this measurement has yet to be made. (And the very fact that it has not been made, not even on paper, tells anyone who will listen that it cannot be made.) [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 14:16, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Removed claim of experimental verification for 2nd postulate ==

In the statement of the second postulate, I have removed the sentence: "This postulate has been verified experimentally." For my reasons, I will quote what I wrote on [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Special relativity]]:

:"In general experiments don't and can't ''verify'' theories, they can only ''falsify'' them.  Repeated attempts to falsify the predictions of a theory constitute not ''proof of'', but ''evidence for'' a theory. In the case of special relativity there is a considerable body of experimental evidence consistent with the predictions of special relativity.  There might be (and some claim there are) other theories which are ''also'' consistent with this body of experimental evidence.  To say that the second "postulate has been verified experimentally" is sloppy and misleading at best. It should be removed, in favor of a section titled something like "experimental evidence for special relativity". [[User:Paul August|Paul August]] 23:00, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)"

      A Wee Bit of Free Advice for Anyone Who
      Wishes to Contribute to the Proposed
      SR Experimental Evidence Section

:All of the results of special relativity (SR) are explicitly given via its math, aka its Lorentz transformation equations.

:Since these equations cannot be derived sans the use of at least two clocks in each frame, all of SR's math (and thus all of SR itself) is dependent upon Einstein's definition of clock synchronization and its inherent lack of absolute simultaneity.

:Thus, all of the results of SR are given by '''man''', not nature, so none are laws of nature, and all of SR's two-clock results are incorrect due to the absence of absolute simultaneity.

:Therefore, all of the results of SR are either circular or incorrect. 

:For example, its one-way light speed invariance is fully circular because it is given at the start via a mere definition from man.

:For another example, its "length contraction" is an incorrect result due to the SR observer's inability to pin down (or locate) the endpoints of a passing rod absolutely simultaneously.

:For yet another example, "time dilation" is an incorrect result again due to SR's lack of absolute simultaneity. (A passing clock is always compared with two of Einstein's absolutely asynchronous clocks in a given frame, with the incorrect result that the passing clock has "slowed.")

:Here is a simple proof that SR does not even pertain to intrinsic or actual clock rhythms: Although a single, passing, steady-velocity atomic clock cannot possibly have more than one internal atomic rhythm, SR's observers in various frames find that the clock "runs at many different rates." (And similar proofs apply to SR's "length contraction" and its "momentum variance.")

:It is not possible to experimentally test the sole basis of SR (aka the second postulate) because this postulate gives its result at the start. In other words, if one manually forces one's clocks to obtain one's prechosen one-way light speed invariance/isotropy, then of course one's clocks will obtain it. (They will also obtain the relativistic results, such as SR's "time dilation" and "length contraction.")

:To top it off, SR does not physically explain the Michelson-Morley experiment (whereas Lorentz's theory does).

== On the "circularity" of the second postulate ==

Cadwgan, quite rightly (if I understand him correctly), points out that the postulates as they are often stated (including in Einstein's 1905 paper, as well as in many textbooks) contain a certain circularity: the speed of light is postulated to be constant in all frames, but velocity is measured by times at different points in a frame, and times at different points were synchronized by Einstein by assuming that the speed of light is constant.  On the other, hand, modern papers (e.g. Wolf and Gerard, above) circumvent this difficulty by rephrasing the question as one of the equivalence between Einstein's light-pulse synchronization and classical slow clock transport.

Still, it is an interesting question &mdash; it would indeed be surprising if there were a ''new'' objection to relativity on purely philosophical grounds, and in fact Cadwygan's argument turns out to be quite old.  So old (nearly a century), in fact, and disposed of so long ago, that I had to spend some time in the library and look through a couple of dozen books to find any reference to it at all.

Early writers, including Einstein himself, were apparently content to state that the theory was internally consistent and leave it at that, a treatment that was carried over into a number of textbooks (though most don't even broach the subject of circularity).  However, the question was apparently debated in the first half of the 20th century, and the conclusion was the same as the one I came to above: there is an implicit postulate that Einstein's light-based definition of measures of length and time at different points must be consistent with the pre-relativistic definition via slow transport of "clocks" and "rulers".  This postulate can be and has been tested against experiment (such as in the Wolf and Gerard paper, above).

This resolution is discussed, for example, in a textbook by Born and another by Pauli, although the clearest discussion I found was in a ~1950 textbook by a French experimental physicist (whose name escapes me).  I have a long list of interesting quotes on the subject in my office, and perhaps tomorrow I will write up a short article for Wikipedia that the present page can link to.

As I have said, rephrasing the question does not circumvent the difficulty.

Here is the relevant equation:
:::the 2nd postulate &ne; slow clock transport

I have made no mere philosophical objection, and my objection was not disposed of long ago (or even yesterday).

The only way to dispose of my objection is to explicitly admit that special relativity does not call for invariance/isotropy in the case of light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks, and that this is not given via definition ''prior'' to the "measurement," making it purely circular, trivial, and not given by nature (so it is not a law of nature).

And while you are at it, please prove that Einstein's one-way, two-clock invariance is the correct result. (I have already proved experimentally that it is not, but this simplest of experiments was simply ignored, which usually means "it is correct.")

Also ignored was my citation of the 1992 paper which proved that invariance and isotropy are not necessarily the results of the two-clock, one-way light speed measurement.

:Where's the proof you're referring to here?  Is it the one where you incorrectly analyzed a relativistic situation using classical mechanics? --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 20:29, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

My simple proof that light's one-way speed varies with frame velocity was given above under the heading "Second Postulate."

I did not use classical mechanics. (I used no clocks or rulers.)

I did not analyze a relativistic situation. (I used no clocks or rulers.)

I did present a straightforward experimental proof that light's one-way speed differs for differently-moving observers.

Why not simply cite a specific inaccuracy re my presentation?

Or do you really believe that light from an approaching car's headlamps will not reach two meeting-in-passing observers absolutely differently?

Pardon me for being pushy, but the following challenge needs to be given:

'''............Simple Math Derivation Needed............'''

Even after deliberately disregarding all preceding and subsequent 
words in his book, the fact remains that Einstein at one point 
definitely derived the very simple equation w = c - v.

Here are his own words:
"w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, 
and we have w = c - v. 
The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage 
thus comes out smaller than c."

== Simultaneity and causality --- objection ==

I dispute the reasoning in this part of the article.
It states: 
"Barring some way of traveling faster than light, it is not possible , it is not possible for any matter (or information) to travel from A to C or from C to A. Thus there is no causal connection between A and C."

I agree, that, given the first postulate, it is impossible to ''accellerate'' anything with a timelike (sublight) velocity to or beyond the speed of light.

I dispute that special relativity as derived from the postulates and experimentation ''prohibits'' the ''existance'' of particles moving faster than light.

Think of this: an electron positron pair annihilates and produces photons moving at the speed of light.
This is not ''accelleration'' as we use to think of, but as a result, the system ''suddenly'' moves at the speed of light not violating relativity. (Don't mind that, by momentum conservation, the photons will be flying in
different directions. Some mirrors can help there.)
No law of nature or science can hinder those photons to create an new electron-positron pair by pair production.

As to my knowledge, nothing is known wether or not similar processes could create spacelike particles instead of timelike ones.

The statement that "<b>Thus</b> there is no causal connection ..." is not backed by the theory.

If, to the reverse, the ''additional assumption'' of the causality principle is assumed, the impossibility of things moving faster than light can be deduced.

[[User:217.81.158.237|217.81.158.237]] 18:07, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Well, you're right that relativity doesn't prohibit FTL, but that sentence starts off, "Barring some way of traveling faster than light, ", so the conclusion follows. A fairly common way of putting it is, "Relativity, (unrestricted) FTL, Causality; choose two."

:Anyway, that section is trying to contrast the timelike interval AB with the spacelike interval AC, so bringing in FTL would just get in the way.

:::Maybe I am mistaken, but don't physicists talk about particles that travel FTL? I know that I have heard of tachyons. If they do, though, they will have imaginary mass and length and time will flow to them in an imaginary direction. This means that they will be impossible to detect and according to some physicists, ''that'' means that they don't exist. Some physicists have said that space and time are at right angle to each other which implies that time is imaginary space and vice versa. I might even be so rash as to define a second as such:
::::<math>1sec=i*300,000,000m</math>

== Anti-gravity? ==

Does the effect of relativistic mass leave any room for the possibility of negating gravitational fields? That is, if one could get electrons or other particles (obviuosly a lot of these particles) orbiting at relativistic speeds around an object, would any of the surrounding matter experiance a less powerful gravitational force from the earth's field, making them lighter?
== Absolute rest ==

Special relativity takes into account the fact that nothing can be accelerated to the speed of light in a vacuum. Does it also take into account the fact that nothing can be deccelerated to absolute rest in a vacuum?

[[User:GoldenBoar|GoldenBoar]] 21:36, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:There is nothing in special relativity that prevents an object from being at rest (in fact, in some reference frame, any given object will be at rest). It's the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] that prevents you from simultaneously knowing both the position and momentum of an object (meaning that if you know an object is at rest, or any other specific velocity, relative to you, you have no idea where it is). That's an aspect of [[quantum mechanics]], not special relativity.

:What special relativity does is state that light always appears to travel at C no matter what the relative velocities of the emitter and the observer, and works through consequences of that axiom (which ends up giving time dilation, mass gain, and length contraction for relative velocities approaching C, and the C speed limit). --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] 22:55, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Temperature is only defined for a collection of particles. A single particle can appear to have any velocity you please, depending on what frame you choose to look at it from. Furthermore, because the kinetic energy invested in temperature has a known, very simple, relation, you can easily calculate what the mass at zero temperature would be for a collection of particles from measurements of its mass at nonzero temperatures. In practice, there are sources of error for non-ideal solids and gases, but these aren't related to the argument you're referring to. --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] 00:52, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

== Is there anything physical moving in [[space-time]]? == 

This has more to do with [[general relativity]] but how can anything physical move in space-time?

:That site was done by someone who doesn't understand the basics of dimensional analysis.

::True true.  There is time in space-time.  One way to look at it: in a time-relative minowski space (i.e. one with the the time origin (t=0) at the current time), as the current time changes at a constant rate, the points are consistently shifted "down" (or up, however the space is orientated) in the t direction, at a constant rate.  In any case, that basic minkoski space, as I understand, represents the [[state]] of the system, from the pov of the local reference frame.

::All bodies in space-time (minkowski space) have inertia.  I.e. they "move", but they do not change energy levels; they conserve speed (velocity).  Were a body to accelerate (it's energy level thus changing), a force would ipso facto be involved, and we would be discussing a bending of space.

== NPOV problem ==

For the past 15 years the problems with both Special Relativity Theory (SRT) and General Relativity Theory (GRT) have been discussed in the Journal Galilean Electrodynamics ISSN 1047-4811 published by Space Time Analysis, Ltd. This contradicts the article sentence "However, at macroscopic scales and in the absence of strong gravitational fields, special relativity is now universally accepted by the physics community and experimental results which appear to contradict it are widely believed to be due to unreproducible experimental error.". In fact the the above journal was created to counteract the suppression of any questioning of Relativity.

: There are much bigger concerns with NPOV, for example the corrections I made half a year ago to the biased POV about mass definitons have been vandalised and replaced by the same biased POV. Worse, misconceptions about the theory of Newton that I corrected and extended have been deleted and partly replaced by misinformation. 
: In the near future I'll reinsert the corrections, with some explanations and references on this page to the ignorant as well as to bystanders (isn't Wikipedia meant to REDUCE ignorance?!). [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:00, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

In the March/April 2005 issue of Galilean Electrodynamics page 23 is an article titled "First-Order Fiber-Interferometric Experiments for Crucial Test of Light-Speed Constancy". This article covers the experimental design requirements to test some of the features of relativity. The last sentence at the bottom of page 23 is "Therefore, the assertion that light speed is still c in a system moving translationally relative to Earth has not yet been verified.". Relativity is a theory that has not been adequately tested. The last three sentences in the above article are "Here, we challenge the relativistic physicists: please don't try to make the light-speed constancy un-definable. If you care to define that the speed of light is the same for any moving observer, we will design a GPS experiment to show it is not the truth. Give us a clear definition, and we will disprove it.".

Also "Special Relativity Theory (SRT)" not "special theory of relativity" is standard in the above article and journal. Twice when I changed it in the Wikipedia article, it has been put back. I guess it's whatever people want but it's not what people who are discussing the issues are using.

This inability is, of course, owed to the Vast Relativistic Conspiracy, and not due to the disinformation they seem eager to spread (see above). The mention of [[GPS]] is just hilarious. The entire functioning of GPS is based on relativity, and I seriously doubt that a theory that doesn't provide a model that closely approximates reality would have been sufficient in this undertaking. It's also safe to say that the evidence for SRT is a lot more solid that that for Newtonian (Galilean) physics.

I understand [[quantum mechanics]] just enough, not to make any great discoveries in the field, but enough to understand the basics.  [[Special Relativity]] is the same way.  I found something interesting though, relativity implies both wave-particle duality and supersymmetry!  A wave is a carrier of eneergy from place to place.  A paritcle can be viewed as a carrier of mass from place to place. Relativity says energy is the fourth-dimensional extendsion of momentum (which is mass times velosity). This implies that waves are fourth-dimensional extendsion of particles! This also implies that the carriers of energy ([[Bosons]]) are extendsions of the carriers of mass ([[Fermions]])! Wave-particle duality and supersymmetry.  It seems so simple I'm surprized that this was overlooked for so many years.--[[User:SurrealWarrior|SurrealWarrior]] 18:36, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The universe seems to be arranged in [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. There are various levels at which you can understand it. The level we are most famililar with is the level of everyday life. Going down we run into the levels of organs, cells, molecular biology, chemistry. Each level has its own laws which work in certian "special cases" with all violations at the "extreams". [[Complex adaptive systems|Complex Adaptive]] [[swarm intelligence|Swarms]] exhibit similar layered behavior also, at each layer the swarm is made of smaller complex adaptive systems. This layered behavior doesn't appear in swarms made of simple systems. This all seems to imply that either there is no bottom to the layers of the universe(and no TOE) or, the bottom layer is made of smart, [[Complex adaptive systems|adaptive]] [[particles]].--[[User:SurrealWarrior|SurrealWarrior]] 05:15, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, the universe only has one set of laws.  It's just that under different conditions, different portions of the laws become the dominant force.  Scientists tend to simplify things by only using and studying those portions of the laws that are dominant for any given set of conditions.  This leads to the appearance that  [[quantum physics]], [[Newtonian physics]], and [[general relativity]] are three different sets of laws. --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 03:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

== New image and caption ==

First of all, my thanks to [[user:Cyp|Cyp]] for that amazing image.  It is quite marvelous and very, very much should be in this article.  (It could also be on the [[Lorentz transformation]] article, but it '''must''' be on this one in any case.  It has a lot of expanatory power and is a tremendous asset to this article.)

I have framed it and greatly expanded the caption.  I hope that the expanded caption will help people to understand it and what is going on.  If people can find a way to shorten the cation and/or make it clearer I would not mind, although I doubt that much cutting can be done without losing meaningful content.  Similarly if people see something significant that I have not mentioned then please feel free to expand it. --[[User:Ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:37, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

: Yes, it is a truly outstanding addition to this article. If you are still around [[user:Cyp|Cyp]], well done ! (did you make the animation yourself ?). It should '''definitely''' be here. The chunk of text in the caption is a little lengthy, but can't really change much there. However, if shortening the caption becomes an issue, then parts of the caption could refer to the main text, where the animation can be discussed further. ---[[User:Mpatel|Mpatel]] [[User_talk:Mpatel | (talk)]] 15:46, August 23, 2005 (UTC)

::Yes, I'm still around, and I did make it myself. (See the [[:image:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|image description page]] for the source.) I made it very short, to keep it under ¾ MB. Wasn't sure how to explain the picture with a short caption, so I just dumped it on the page without a caption to let someone else worry about it. Thanks, I'm glad the image is liked.

== the mass dispute ==

The concept of velocity dependent mass, relativistic mass, is examined and is found to be inconsistent with
the geometrical formulation of special relativity. This is not a novel result; however, many continue to use
this concept and some have even attempted to establish it as the basis for special relativity. 

: Actually, velocity dependent mass (although not relativistic mass) was at the basis of SRT, and even the first verified prediction of SRT. IOW, your(?) allegation is known to be historically at fault. 
:For half a century a large amount of textbooks and authorities on that subject used that concept - I learned it from Alonso&Finn and many others learned it from Feynman. Only in recent years there has been a push (or should I write Putch?!) by some influential people to abandon the concept, partly by spreading misinformation that the uninformed swallow (I call incorrect claims by experts of a certain age lies, because it's humanly almost impossible that they don't know the truth.) The cause can harldy be convention or lack of information, as the debate is too much an emotional dispute - instead it appears to be a clash of ideologies and ontologies, similar as the never fully solved difference between Lorentz and Einstein. 

It is argued that
the oft-held view that formulations of relativity with and without relativistic mass are equivalent is incorrect.

: Hmm, there can be no doubt about them being *by definition* mathematically equivalent, but for reasons of consistency (as already pointed out on the main page) some prefer relativistic mass, while others prefer rest mass to be called "mass" for better compatibility with the now popular geometric reinterpretation. 

Left as a heuristic device a preliminary study of first time learners suggest that misconceptions can develop when the concept is introduced without basis. 

: Indeed, that suggestion is misleading, it's an under-the-belt punch to suggest that people as Feynman had misconceptions about mass, or were stuck at "first-time learner level". I had not yet reflected on it, but now that you put my attention to it: this kind of dirty war is unacceptable for Wikipedia, I demand that phrase to be corrected to a neutral (NPOV) description of the disagreement (which BTW is already correctly indicated in the article).

In order to gauge the extent and nature of the use of relativistic
mass a survey of the literature on relativity has been undertaken. The varied and at times self-contradicting
use of this concept points to the lack of clear consensus on the formulation of relativity. As geometry lies at
the heart of all modern representations of relativity, it is urged, once again, that the use of the concept at all
levels be abandoned.

: Hmm, who is Anonymous @bellsouth.net? 

: Yes I know that people try to impose their POV and even demand the suppression of differing ontologie. I trust that such improper behaviour will have no chance in Wikipedia, as succombing to such ''propaganda'' is against the rules. But am I right to notice that the person who copy-pasted the text of that paper doesn't understand NPOV? At least he/she could have presented the two sides of the debate, or indicated that he/she didn't. For example, an internal report of the CERN (publicly accessible) shows that relativistic mass is actually used and accepted by a number of physicists (not a peer reviewed publication, but neither is the above Arxiv doc!). I could just as well give a similarly biased presentation which largely agrees with that overview, but disagrees on the crucial points, mainly by correcting the errors of that paper and by adding my own errors that push the contrary conclusion. (It's a common propaganda method, also used in religions, to "provide a survey" that suggests a NPOV, only to reach one's own POV as "conclusion"). Furthermore, the writer above is at odds with Einstein who admitted that his 1905 paper inconsistently based dynamics on kinematics, while the used instruments on which the units for kinematical derivation are based ("length", "time"), depend themselves on dynamics. 

: Clearly, the debate must be mentioned in Wikipedia, and IMO it's now reasonably balanced; the most popular(?) stand is in the main text and the threatened POV confined inside a separate paragraph. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 23:18, 19 October 2005 (UTC) and 12:22, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

I now found the likely cause of much misunderstanding:
In a paper by Okun in Physics Today (June 1989 p.31, "The concept of mass"), he may have caused confusion between "relativistic mass" and the "transverse"/"longitudual" mass concepts that were used around 1900:

"These are the very expressions with which Lorentz introduced the two masses. Together with the "relativistic mass" in the relation p = m_r v, where m_r = E/c^2 (which is equal to m_t when m =/= 0, but which had a more general meaning applicable also in the case of photons), these masses formed the basis of the language physicists used at the beginning of the century."

People can easily confuse the different concepts from reading that paper (or a later one of him, if he continued obfuscating them), and this misunderstanding may have played a significant role in the crusade against "relativistic mass". In particular, it may have caused the misunderstanding that relativistic mass is another word for transverse mass, or that F=ma is supposed to be generally valid with relativistic mass. However, that same paper has useful references, for example that relativistic mass" was called "the mass" by Tolman in 1912 - to be checked! [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:17, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Errors in "second postulate" ==
It read: "Second postulate (invariance of c) The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is the same to all inertial observers, is the same in all directions".

NOT so: SRT is a theory of physics, and Einstein made sure in 1905 to *not* include isotropy of light speed in the postulate, but in the following *operational definitions*, as it can't be verified by experiments, by definition.
In SRT the OWLS is freely *chosen* to be isotropical by the experimenters. See Einstein's definition of "light speed" in his 1905 paper (html); also the discussion yesterday and today in sci.physics.relativity (search in Google groups for OWLS in subject and tom roberts , 19 Oct). [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:39, 20 October 2005 (UTC).
Note also that misunderstanding about this point apparently played a role in this article not being a Featured Article in the past, without thorough verification.
What made Einstein's approach appealing, was how he derived the LT from a *minimal* number of assumptions. For example: that light speed will look isotropic when clocks are synchronized by means of clock transport, follows from the *first* postulate.

BTW, there is still more wrong with that postulate paragraph: SRT is in particular *not* a theory about metaphysics. Unfounded metaphysical claims by editors have no place in SRT! Instead of that, the postulates should be phrased in a manner that closely follows Einstein 1905, for he chose his definitions with care, he himself closely following what others had concluded before him. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 23:21, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

:The actual words that Einstein used in his second postulate (in the English translation) are:

:''"Any ray of light moves in the "stationary" system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body. Hence velocity = (light path) / (time interval) where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in §1."''

:"§1" refers to the definition of what we now call Einsteinian synchronisation using light signals. If Einstein were talking about "two-way light speed" (TWLS) then it would make no sense for him to have to explain what he meant by "time interval", as it would, in that case, just be the proper time recorded by a single clock. But he would have had to explain what he meant by "light path" being a there-and-back distance.

:The second postulate should indeed be interpreted to refer to "one-way light speed" (OWLS). It contains within it the requirement, within Special Relativity, that clocks be synchronised via Einsteinian Synchronisation. Isotropy of light speed is more than  just an "operational definition" for experimenters: it is an intrinsic feature of the theory. If you choose a different synchronisation method, you're not studying Special Relativity, you're studying another theory (for example, the version of Ether Theory by Mansouri & Sexl, which is mathematically equivalent to Special Relativity but has different definitions of coordinate time and velocity).--[[User:Dr Greg|Dr Greg]] 18:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I see what you mean: you do have a point about Einstein's presentation. However, principles of physics are based on observation, not on speculation or mere convention or freely chosen procedures (in fact, that timing convention was already in use at that time). 
::To do a re-take: your above quote is from paragraph 2, ''after'' he ''defined'' the coordinate "time" which is used in your above quote. He defined light speed operationally as follows:

::''"In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity:

:: ''2AB/(t_A'-t_A) = c

::''to be a universal constant--the velocity of light in empty space."

:: From this together with the freely chosen coordinate time follows that also one-way light speed is determined as c, which is what he wanted to get for convenience. 
::Of course, how to present it is a matter of taste: it's possible to write it in the mathematically simpler way as you propose and as Einstein arrived at presenting it, but it makes the full formulation of the second postulate more complex, without adding anything useful. In that formulation of the light speed postulate, the time interval that is used for defining light speed, is itself defined by a procedure that is based on two-way light speed (c). That definition needs to be mentioned and explained. Eliminating the circularity brings you back to the definition with one clock...

== Triangle of Velocities proves that invariant speed is mathematical error ==

The article at http://www.masstheory.org/triangle_of_velocities.pdf presents detailed analysis of Lorentz transformation, it's derivation procedure and formal mathematical proof that introducing "invariant" speed is indeed nothing but mathematical error.

:I suppose that you mean light speed, as defined in the second postulate. But what do you mean with "indeed"? I hope you didn't misunderstand my criticism on misrepresenting the second postulate as criticism on the second postulate itself, which as Einstein explained, was based on experimental results.

== Relativity and unifying Electromagnetism - error? ==

I think that the main article is practically ready to make it a featured article; but just now my eye fell on the last paragraph, and I suspect that it's flawed. For how can one completely make the magnetic field of a current loop disappear? I don't think so. Note: In the coming days I'll be too busy with other things, so if I'm not mistaken, please correct this without me. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 21:32, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

:Its not making the current in a loop disappear, its making the current in a straight wire disappear. To make the current in a loop disappear, you have to be in a spinning (i.e. non-inertial) frame of reference. But still, why would the magnetic field not disappear, and the loop become an electrostatically charged loop?[[User:PAR|PAR]] 22:01, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

OK, you already picked up one glitch in the description. But different from the straight-line motion of two parallel moving charges (Einstein 1905), in a wire we have relative motion of negative and positive charges. You can't make that disappear. Thus, in any frame there are moving charges. How could then the magnetic field disappear? 
My advice: either consult a good (I mean Very Good) textbook on this and use that as source (I saw no reference anyway), or stick to the simple case of Einstein 1905 (available on the web) and which also is not too complicated for an introduction page to SRT. IMO that last option would be really the best, as a current in a wire is more complicated than it looks. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:56, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

Now it's almost 2 weeks later, and that a paragraph is still defect (questionable claims without backup from a reliable source). If this week still nothing is done about it, and if I find the time, I'll partly rewrite it using the simple case of Einstein 1905 (but if someone else likes to do that, please do!). [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 12:31, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

:I'm starting to think that you are right. If the wire is electrostatically neutral with moving negative charges, but, say, equally dense non-moving positive charges, there is no moving coordinate system that will make the current go to zero. For a moving observer the wire will acquire an electrostatic net charge, but the current can't be made to go to zero. If the current is not zero, the magnetic field is not zero. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 15:52, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

::From a mathematical point of view, the [[four-current]] is a four-vector ''J'' = (''c''&rho;, '''j'''). If the charge density &rho; is zero, then no [[Lorentz transformation]] will annihilate the current '''j'''. Trying to use physics language: if the wire carries a current but it is electrostatically neutral, the charge density is zero, so the four-current is space-like. However, every four-current with zero current '''j''' is time-like, and it is impossible to transform a space-like vector into a time-like vector. So I agree, the current can't be made to go to zero. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 18:01, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

== nominated a daughter article for deletion ==

I nominated a daughter article [[Special relativity for beginners]] for deletion. My gist is basically this should be merged, since forks are bad, and that the parent article needs this kind of language in the first place, and should not have its existence for an excuse for people to continue writing technical details in the current article without elaboration. This is the Wikipedia policy: include as much details as possible, but explain them in the main article in simpler language. Not the other way round, move the simple language off the main article and onto another one! It is discussed at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Special relativity for beginners]] -- [[User:Natalinasmpf|Natalinasmpf]] 16:51, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

Yes, I don't like this separation. And the main page needs some of those diagrams- my feeling is that we need more Minkowski diagrams in the article to help those who are more visual. Readers shouldn't have to plug numbers into Lorentz equations, the diagrams should do it for them.[[User:Wolfkeeper|WolfKeeper]] 17:58, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:I am against merger because it will disrupt the [[Special relativity]] page and because, in most textbooks the [[Special relativity for beginners]] page is summarised as 'according to SR the space-time interval is invariant therefore, as s^2=gxx ...' (ie: '''one sentence'''). I am also against merger because there are at least three ways of explaining SR: simultaneous linear equations with Einstein's assumptions, Minkowski/Noether invariance with a geometrical interpretation and advanced differential geometry (cf:general covariance). Should we include full guides to each of these approaches? All three approaches are actually deeply related but explaining the relationship will need a short course on maths. The advantage of using the second approach for ''explaining'' SR is that it is geometrical and, as Plato put it, understanding is largely geometrical. Lastly, I am also against merger because SR is widely taught in terms of Einstein's raw assumptions and if we portray it differently in the main article we will confuse intermediate students and not be thanked by their teachers.

== Hyperbolic Geometry and Special Relativity ==

The following got added to the article by an anonymous author and removed by me:

: ''Special Relativity is a physical model of hyperbolic geometry. For example, on the Poincare Disk, set up a polar coordinate system. Then any point on the Poincare Disk can be identified with a uniform motion on a plane. The point (2, 30), for example, could represent an object travelling on a plane with a uniform rapidity of 2 in the direction of 30 degrees north of the polar axis. (The rapidity of an object is the arctanh of its speed as a proportion of the speed of light. An object travelling with rapidity 2, for example, would be going tanh(2) = 96.4% of the speed of light.) The Poincare distance between two points on the Poincare Disk can be identified with the relative speed between two objects travelling in uniform motion on the plane. So every theorem in hyperbolic geometry can be translated into a true statement in special relativity.''

This is a very dense and misleading write-up.  A constantly accelerating observer is undergoing what in special relativity is called [[hyperbolic motion]], but this does not endow [[spacetime]] with a [[hyperbolic geometry]].  (I know that this is not what was being said or intended, but it was being implied.)  The point being made is also very subtle and trivial.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:59, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

I agree that the addition of hyperbolic geometry was too densely written, and somewhat misleading.  (In the last sentence, perhaps the writer should have said something like "...every theorem in hyperbolic geometry can be translated into a theorem in relativistic kinematics, and conversely.")  Still, the connection between hyperbolic geometry and relativistic kinematics is pretty cool (well, at least I think so, but then again I'm a geometer!) and do I think it belongs somewhere in Wikipedia. I'm just not sure where! [[User:Tuolumne|Tuolumne]] 07:27, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

It might even be easier to read in the 4,2,1,3,6,7,status order; since that way you can show how the postulate agrees with lorentz equations and it all makes sense. That's even the historical way it happened. Personally I think starting with the postulates is unduly mystical, but not formally incorrect in any way.[[User:Wolfkeeper|WolfKeeper]] 19:13, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

Historically it started with the impossibility to pinpoint an absolute reference frame, with the conclusion that the PoR seems to hold as if one is always at rest in an ether - from which follow the postulates. To start with the Lorentz transformations is IMO a bit heavy.  Anyway, my main point is that "status" should be near the end, and I notice that you agree on that. Let's wait for more opinions.

I have removed it because:
* The text lists no consequences of SR that I can see.

Dears contributors

I want to pose a question, and I hope that any of you can answer.

There is any plausibility on assert that all particles, and so the all the other bodies in Universe, ''travels to the future''?? Can I say that the ''"light speed can be considered as the velocity by what an observer moves yourself towards future"''. This is (as long as I can translate adequately from Portuguese) an free translation from an quote excerpted from the Portuguese version of Wikipedia (http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/EspaÃ§o-tempo). This is an article to treat of ''Spacetime''. Would any of you please answer me about this kind of reasoning? I would be happy if any commments can be send to

: I don't think that would be a scientifically correct statement, but it does have intuitive appeal. In a [[Minkowski diagram]], the set of spatial points as a function of time could be seen as a "movie" by moving the spatial axes along the corresponding time axes at the speed of light.

== Clock Comparisons ==

These effects are not merely appearances; the time in the different frame of references essentially do travel at different rates to each other and the lengths of objects really are physically changed whilst in relative motion.

a) Read it carefully and this sentence looks pretty garbled.
b)  In particular 'the time....do travel at different rates'  actually, it's
worse than the usual cliches make out.  If  Mrs Stripe is moving (inertially)
at an appreciable fraction of c with respect to Mr Plain then after they have
met, her clock runs slower than his on events in her immediate neighbourhood,
and faster than his in his neighbourhood.
Before they meet, exactly the opposite is the case.  In short some processes
observed by both run faster according to Ma Stripe, some run faster according
to Daddy Plain, and a sufficiently convoluted and widespread process will
look like a bit of both to both at different times.  Clocks don't 'run at
different rates' - that suggests that they are comparable.  They're not.
c) Even if Ma Stripe has a sufficiently powerful telescope to read Plain's
clock, the moment she reads 4 am, most events she sees as simultaneous with
that reading aren't simultaneous with it for Daddy Plain.  The reading is
meaningless.  Some of the events Plain thinks happened at 4am are already
past for her and some are in a far future.

== Two way "calculating" velocities? ==

Why do we elismate(changed to "estimate"--[[User:HydrogenSu|HydrogenSu]] 12:02, 30 January 2006 (UTC)) phase velocity by <math>\mathcal E=mc^2 </math>,and elismate group velocity by <math>E=\sqrt{P^2C^2+m_0^2C^4}</math>?

Any differences?

I think that reasons may be a group velocity can represent a true body when it moves.(which might need to considerate both of rest-mass and move-mass <math>\mathcal (P^2C^2) </math> effect) But a phase velocity is just a S.H.O. vibrating.(which doesn't need to considerate of rest-mass effect) <small>&mdash;''The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by'' [[User:HydrogenSu|HydrogenSu]] ([[User talk:HydrogenSu|talk]]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/HydrogenSu|contribs]]) 18:41, 26 January 2006.</small><!--Inserted with Template:Unsigned-->

'''In a few days,I proposed my new opinions as the followings.''' 

:The '''''"phase"''''' velocity means that particles as sets of waves(Q.M.'s wave-pocket) and vibrates in Y axis (represnts as heights) only. The famous English physist,P.A.M.

== Criticism of Relativity Theory ==

I'm not sure about this. I left the section in, because it seems there's a real NPOV here- there really are quite a lot of people who don't understand relativity and make honest but usually ignorant criticism of the theory. Perhaps we should move it into a separate article? (Having said this, I am quite reluctant to do this, but generally the experience in the wikipedia of this kind of thing has not been too bad at all, but nevertherless I am still a bit nervous.)[[User:Wolfkeeper|WolfKeeper]] 01:26, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

The phrase "His 'proof' that Relativity theory is inconsistent has not been in any way supported by other scientists or experimental evidence." is incorrect, but it's a bit subtle. I plan to write a part about Dingle and reactions in [[twin paradox]] (that's what he focussed on), but I haven't come around doing that yet. Now I correct that phrase to "special relativity" and I turned the phrase around, as proof of absence is hard to give. That should make it quite correct IMO, and keeps it with the subject matter of this article. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 11:45, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

: The section that starts "The German scientist group g.o.mueller..." in the current revision is very odd indeed. It's also pretty incoherent. It looks like it's been machine translated from German (or possibly Italian) without any editing at all.

:::Picture two coordinate systems, one moving in the x-direction relative to the other.  The two origins overlap at time t=t'=0.
:::Let's imagine that there's an observer at the origin of the unprimed frame and a clock that emits a flash of light every second at the origin of the primed frame.  As the primed frame moves away from the unprimed origin, not only does it's clock appear to tick slower (the spacing between the flashes is larger because the clock is moving away), but it's time is also delayed because the flashes take a nonzero amount of time to travel from the clock to the observer.  The first term accounts for the first effect, and the second term for the latter.

:::: The term that bugs you creates an effect called the [[relativity of simultaneity]].  Imagine a light clock:   |<-------->|.  At rest, the light will go back and forth between the bar characters (which act as mirrors in this discussion) in a time of ''d''/''c'' in each direction where ''c'' is the speed of light and ''d'' is the distance between the mirrors.  Now let's put this light clock in motion:  |<------->| --->.  In our frame of reference, when the light moves to the left, it goes between the mirrors in <math>d/(c + v)</math> (where ''v'' is the speed of the clock) since the clock is moving towards the light.  Then when the light is going to the right, it goes between the mirrors in a time of <math>d'/(c - v)</math>.  So the "tick" is not consistent, but instead alternates faster and slower.  The difference in perception of how the clock operates is explained by "at the same time" being different in co-moving frames of reference.  BTW, because of the Lorentz contraction, <s><nowiki><math>d' = d / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}</math></nowiki></s> <math>d' = d \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}</math>, and this makes it so that the moving light clock ticks at the same average rate (for a given speed) no matter how it is oriented. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:43, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

::::: No, the above is not correct. The error is in saying that the velocities add as c+v or c-v. Velocities do not add in this way. (See the article). All clocks keep steady time, with the same time between ticks, although that time may vary (to you) depending on the speed of the frame (with respect to you). [[User:PAR|PAR]] 02:22, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::: '''Oh yes it is correct.'''  ''Within a given frame of reference'', velocities add linearly even in relativity.  As seen in the observer's frame, the setup is moving at ''v''.  Within that same frame of reference, the light is moving at ''c'' (as it always must).  So of course the time for the light to go between mirrors must be <math>d' / (c \pm v)</math>.  Now if you want to know the speed of the light with respect to the mirrors ''in the frame of reference of the mirrors'', then you use the relativistic addition of velocities (which you refer to), and as expected will get ''c'' in either case.  The unsteady tick (based on each tick being when the light is reflected) is a very real phenomenon, and the <math>c \pm v</math> business also appears in the [[relativity of simultaneity]] article.  The point is that the midtime between reflections of the same mirror is not simultaneous with the reflection off of the other mirror when the setup is in motion.  I advise you to think about that. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:40, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::::Ok, yes, you are correct, except for the statement <math>d'=d\gamma</math>. It should be <math>d=d'\gamma</math>, but I expect thats just a typo. I didn't account for the reflections correctly. I agree, the clock will have two different periods between ticks when viewed from the observer frame. Also, in your answer, saying that the velocities add linearly within a given frame of reference is not correct. The v+c term (for example) does enter into the calculation, but there is no physical object travelling with velocity v+c. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 02:50, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

== Time Dilation ==

The sentence is not correct: 
:"Similarly, in the equation for time t', t is multiplied by gamma in the second non comoving frame. This may be interpreted as time proceeding more slowly when an object is moving relative to another frame of reference." 
because then, it has to be a time "shortening" because 1 sec in rest frame would be more than 1 sec in moving frame.

:That's exactly what time dilation is. Let's say that in my frame it takes 3 minutes to boil an egg, and x=0. From the point of view of a moving frame with a gamma of two; the elapsed time is 6 minutes. Hence time dilation. It's as simple as that.[[User:Wolfkeeper|WolfKeeper]] 22:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
:::No: t' is the time-coordinate of the moving frame. t is yours. you are in t. t' is another frame in which you are not. In your picture a person in t' would have cooked two eggs, in 6 minutes (one after the other) while you have only time for one in 3 minutes. You can only compare the rest frame with the moving frame by using the equation. you cannot use the equation to go from t' to t by inverting it.

::So if the moving frame thinks that it takes six minutes to boil your egg, then does the moving frame think your water is colder, or that the fundamental properties of eggs have changed? --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 05:32, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
:::Frame's don't think. People think. People think that time is dilated :-), but also the mass of the molecules in the egg will be higher; so in a sense the fundamental properties of eggs have changed. The temperature has gone down from the point of view of the moving frame though.[[User:Wolfkeeper|WolfKeeper]] 13:52, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
::::It`s not possible to argue like that, because not the speed of particles defines their temperature but their momentum. It is very dangerous to argue in words.

 the correct calculation would be:
:<math> t' = \gamma (t- \frac{vx}{c^2})  </math>
:<math> t' = \gamma (t- \frac{v\cdot vt}{c^2})  </math>
:<math> t' = \gamma (1-\beta^2)t  </math>
:<math> t' = \sqrt{1-\beta^2} t  </math>
:<math> t' = \frac{1}{\gamma} t  </math>
The point is to express x in terms of v*t, then the equation contains not gamma but 1/gamma, so 1 sec in rest-frame is less than 1 sec in moving frame. --[[User:84.152.247.197|84.152.247.197]] 17:19, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

I think you've swapped around what t and t' refer to. Your maths looks correct to me from a quick glance at it; it's just more complex than it needs to be.

Thank you for your answer.
You cannot swap around t and t' to go to the inverse transformation. You have to go from v -> -v for the inverse transformation. You are always in the rest frame t and the moving frame is always t'. So from every point of view you see the time running more slowly in the other frame. 
the only thing that I like to say is that you cannot "read" the equation for the time as the equation for x, because then you would make the wrong conclusions (when you watch the moving frame, then there time seems to go faster). You have first to use the insertion above.  

== SR, mass and E=MC<sup>2</sup> ==

I recently enjoyed actually reading Einstein's fourth 1905 paper ("does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?" from [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/]).
In that paper, Einstein says
<blockquote>
"If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c2. The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of
radiation evidently makes no difference, so that we are led to the more general
conclusion that '''The mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content'''; if the energy changes
by L, the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 × 10<sup>20</sup>, the energy being
measured in ergs, and the mass in grammes."
</blockquote>
(emphasis mine).

This - the idea that mass and energy are the same thing - has always seemed to me to be one of the key and unique insights of special relativity - but the article here, and other articles on the subject, seem to talk only about the "mass change of radiation" when discussing E=mc<sup>2</sup> - the "consequences" section of this article doesn't mention it at all.

Is there a reason that I don't see why this generalized equivalence shouldn't be more strongly featured in the articles talking about special relativity? --[[User:Alvestrand|Alvestrand]] 09:21, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

: First of all, mass and energy are according to Einstein not exactly the same thing, and I agree. Energy and mass are different concepts, but mass = energy/c^2. When normalizing to c=1 they become numerically equal. 
: Secondly, that equation is not SRT; Einstein showed that SRT can be used to derive it. I have also seen derivations without SRT. Thus it looks appropriate to me that in ''this'' article it's not much discussed. 
: However, I saw somewhere the suggestion to write a separate page about the history of [[E=mc2]]. That would be a very good idea, IMO.

== Redunant (sic) second postulate - edits by EnormousDude ==

This article is not a place to state a personal opinion.  Not everyone agrees that the second postulate follows from the first.  A separate section discussing the fact that some believe the 2nd postulate to be redundant is more appropriate than stating an opinion as fact.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 02:52, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

:On the other hand, the second postulate is frequently misstated. I edited the "Postulates of special relativity" after reading this article on PhysOrg.com
:http://www.physorg.com/news11829.html
:One of the points that Baierlein makes, is that relativity is generally taught using a version of the second postulate which is far less intuitively plausible than the second postulate as originally formulated by Einstein. I hence replaced the second postulate text with an exact quote and added comments.
:[[User:Minor Crank|Minor Crank]] 12:42, 25 March 2006 (UTC) (aka 67.163.106.133 before I created a user name)

The exact quote you contributed comes from the introduction.  Later, Einstein writes "These two principles we deﬁne as follows: -" and "2. Any ray of light moves in the “stationary” system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body."  Contrast this with his earlier statement that "light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body".  See the difference?  In the former, he refers to a co-ordinate system and a ''determined'' speed while in the later, he refers to empty space and a ''definite'' speed.

Earlier, Einstein writes "Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good.  In order to render our presentation more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the stationary system."

IMHO, Einstein here identifies 'stationary system' with what we now call an 'inertial system'.  Taken together with his 2nd principle, as he ''defined'' it above, Einstein does appear to ''assume'' that the measured speed of light in an inertial system of co-ordinates is c.

I referred to [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/] and [http://dbserv.ihep.su/~elan/src/einstein05b/eng.pdf] for the quotations.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 16:25, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

:The actual demonstration of the fact that the measured speed of light in the "moving" system of coordinates is ''c'' does not take place until Section 3, "Theory of the Transformation of Co-ordinates and Times from a Stationary System to another System in Uniform Motion of Translation Relatively to the Former", where Einstein writes: "We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving system, is propagated with the velocity c, if, as we have assumed, this is the case in the stationary system; for we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity."
:Einstein follows this statement with a demonstration that a spherical wave emitted in the "stationary" system with velocity ''c'' at time t = τ = 0, when the origins of the two coordinate systems coincide, appears also to be a spherical wave with velocity ''c'' in the "moving" system.
:Clearly, Einstein did ''not'' include invariance of the velocity of light as measured by any inertial observer as part of his starting assumptions.
:[[User:Minor Crank|Minor Crank]] 00:58, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

Please re-read the very quote you have provided.  Einstein assumed that the 2 principles were true but had yet to prove that ''they were not contradictory''.  That is, it is not at all clear at the outset that there is a co-ordinate transformation that is compatible with the two principles that he defined earlier.  I quote from section 3:  "With the help of this result we easily determine the quantities <math>\xi, \eta, \zeta</math> by expressing in equations that light ('''as required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, in combination with the principle of relativity''') is also propagated with velocity c when measured in the moving system" (emphasis is mine).   Einstein states quite clearly here that the notion that light is progagated at the velocity of c in the moving system is ''required'' by the combination of the 2 principles.  Thus, IMHO, section 3 proves only that there is a transformation that is compatible with the 2 principles.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 06:20, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

:Let us look at Einstein's use of the second postulate.
:1) We are agreed that the introductory statement did not include any mention of invariance of ''c'' as measured by the "moving" observer. 
:2) In Section 2, Einstein re-states what he regards to be the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light: "Any ray of light moves in the “stationary” system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity ''c'', whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body." His arguments in this section use only this principle.
:3) In Section 3, he continues using only this limited assumption: "...by inserting the arguments of the function tau and applying the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light ''in the stationary system''" (italics mine). He does not assume correctness of the principle in the moving system.
:4) Continuing in Section 3, Einstein writes, "With the help of this result we easily determine the quantities xi, eta, zeta by expressing in equations that light (as required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, in combination with the principle of relativity) is also propagated with velocity c when measured in the moving system." Einstein continues carefully to distinguish what he terms the "principle of the constancy of the velocity of light" from the more general notion that light might be propagated at ''c'' in the moving system. Rather, he states that the following paragraphs must establish that fact.
:5) Einstein states: "We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving system, is propagated with the velocity ''c'', if, as we have assumed, this is the case in the stationary system..." Einstein repeats that his starting assumptions included only constancy of ''c'' in the stationary system. Einstein proposes to show that '''if''' ''c'' is constant in the stationary system, '''then''' ''c'' must be constant in the moving system. 
:6) "...for we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity." Einstein continues to use the term "principle of the constancy of the velocity of light" ''in exactly the sense in which he expressed it in the introduction.''
:7) Einstein shows that
::x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (c^2)(t^2)
:transforms to 
::xi^2 + eta^2 + zeta^2 = (c^2)(tau^2)
:8) The demonstration that light travels at ''c'' in the moving system "...shows that our two fundamental principles are compatible", by which Einstein means the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, ''still referring to the second principle in the original sense in which he stated it.''
:9) Concerning Section 3, you wrote: "Einstein states quite clearly here that the notion that light is progagated at the velocity of c in the moving system is ''required'' by the combination of the 2 principles." I agree perfectly, the two starting principles being the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of the speed of light in the stationary system. The notion that light is propagated at the velocity of c in the moving system is ''derived'' from the combination of the two starting principles.
:[[User:Minor Crank|Minor Crank]] 10:46, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

:10) You wrote: "IMHO, Einstein here identifies 'stationary system' with what we now call an 'inertial system'." 
:I disagree. Einstein very deliberately chose as his definition of 'stationary system' one with which any of his (almost universally aetherist) contemporaries would be comfortable, namely "a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good."
:Obviously, a 'moving system' would be one in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics might possibly be violated. To an aetherist, such a scenario would make perfect sense, and many experiments at the time were directed towards detecting such violations. On the other hand, if you are at rest with respect to the aether, no motion of an emitter body could possibly alter your measurement of the velocity of light being radiated. Einstein's statement of the second law was carefully worded to be completely acceptable to his aetherist contemporaries.
:[[User:Minor Crank|Minor Crank]] 16:15, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

If, as you claim, Einstein ''derived'' the result that light is propagated at the velocity of c in the moving system, then the assumption that this result holds cannot be used in the derivation of this result, right?  Yet, in section 3, immediately after establishing the form of the transformation for the time coordinate &tau; in the moving system, Einstein writes "For a ray of light emitted at the time &tau; =0 in the direction of the increasing &xi;

:<math>\xi = c \tau</math>..."

Let's summarize step by step where we are at this point:

(a) Einstein assumes that the ray of light is emitted from the origin of the moving system of coordinates (&tau;, &xi;, &eta;, &zeta;)

(b) By applying the 2nd principle only, that the speed of the light ray is c in the stationary system of coordinates (x, y, z, t), he derives the form of the transformation &tau;(x',y,z,t).  

(c) By applying the 1st principle only to (b), that the speed of the light ray must also be c in the '''moving''' system of coordinates, he derives the transformations for &xi; &eta; and &zeta.

So, at this point, Einstein has established the form of the transformations from the coordinates of the stationary system to the coordinates of the moving system ''based on the assumption that a ray of light emitted by a stationary object in the '''moving''' system propagates at c in '''both''' systems''.  I suppose one could say that this assumption is derived from the 2 principles but, IMHO, that is a stretch.  Look at it this way, this is a simple case of "If A AND B THEN C" - if the 1st principle is true and if the 2nd principle is true then then the speed of light is c in the stationary and moving coordinate systems.  Case closed - nothing else needs to be said.  The result has been 'derived' and no further proof is needed as long as one assumes that the 2 very reasonable principles are true.  So what is the rest of the paper for?

Clearly, Einstein needs to show that the the two principles are not contradictory.  To show this, he first ''assumes'' the 'derived' result that the speed of light is c in both coordinate systems.  Thus, contrary to your point (8) above, he cannot ''show'' this result as he assumes it to be true from the outset.  Instead, what he shows is that the coordinate transformation derived from this assumption is consistent thus establishing that the 2 principles are compatible.  

Once again, I think it is quite clear that Einstein ''assumed'' the constancy of the speed of light in ''both'' systems in order to derive the coordinate transformations which he then showed to be consistent proving that the two principles are compatible.  On the other hand, time dilation, length contraction, etc. are quite clearly ''derived'' results.  That is, there were no starting assumptions with respect to these results.

One e-mail should be sufficient.  If not, I will e-mail him also.

BTW, I don't really consider this a debate over whether your edit is appropriate.  If I truly thought it to be inappropriate, I would have reverted your edit first and then explained why on the talk page.  In any event, the historical wording versus the modern wording of the 2nd postulate is certainly an appropriate topic for this article.

Where we disagree appears to me to be with the use of the word 'derive' and what constitues a 'startling' result.  If we assume that the speed of light is c in a coordinate system in which Newtonian mechanics hold regardless of the state of motion of the emitting body AND if we assume that in uniformly moving coordinate systems, Newtonian mechanics hold, it follows that the speed of light is c in uniformly moving coordinate systems.  This is an immediate and purely logical conclusion - and not a particularly startling one, IMHO.

I suppose the reason I'm pushing back here is that I associate the word 'derive' (in this context) with some mathematical process as in the way the transformation equations are derived.  Thus, I would prefer that the entry on the 2nd postulate say something more along the lines of "That the speed of light is measured to be c by all inertial observers is a logical consequence of the combination of the principle of relativity and the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light".  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 19:26, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

:From your modern perspective, I don't doubt that the constancy of the speed of light in moving coordinate systems seems immediate and obvious. Historically, however, this was not so, and many experiments were conducted in an attempt to detect the consequences of movement through the aether, by Roentgen, Eichenwald, Bradley, Wilson, Arago, Fizeau, Airy, Michelson and Morley, Trouton and Noble, etc. 
:The conviction that there should be measurable consequences of movement through an aether was great, and Einstein was careful to frame his starting postulates in such a way that his paper would not suffer immediate rejection. Little by little, through inexorable logic, Einstein leads the reader to an abyss, either to accept or reject his conclusions. To early 20th century physicists, the constancy of ''c'' in all inertial frames as a logical consequence of seemingly innocuous starting assumptions was indeed one of many startling results in Einstein's paper.
:However, it has been over a century since Einstein's seminal publication. To what extent should we retain the historical perspective? From a modern standpoint, Einstein's approach is very "clunky". Several alternative derivations of far greater elegance exist. 
:For example, starting from the first postulate alone, and understanding that any reasonable set of transformations ''must'' form a group, then one finds that there exist only two sets of transformation laws that satisfy the principle of relativity. These are the Galilean and Lorentz groups. If the universe follows Galilean relativity, then there is no upper speed limit to the universe. If the universe follows Lorentzian relativity, then there must exist an upper speed limit. Experimentally, we observe that an upper speed limit exists; therefore the universe must follow Lorentzian relativity. The role of the second law is extremely limited in this development of SR. Basically, the second law exists only to establish the value of the upper speed limit. SR is purely a geometric theory in this development, and light has no special role in its derivation. The velocity of light is observed to correspond rather closely with the upper speed limit, but that's merely a consequence of photons' being either massless or very nearly so.
:So, should we abandon Einstein's primitive, clunky derivation in favor of one of the modern approaches? Perhaps I am being a Luddite, but I don't think so...

Good points that you make here.  This [http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s1-05/1-05.htm] is an interesting read.  I found this particularly interesting:

:"Thus they [Poincare and Lorentz] believed that the speed of light was actually isotropic only with respect to one single inertial frame of reference, and it merely appeared to be isotropic with respect to all the others. Of course, Poincare realized full well (and indeed was the first to point out) that the Lorentz transformations form a group, and the symmetry of this group makes it impossible, even in principle, to single out one particular frame of reference as the true absolute frame (in which light actually does propagate isotropically). Nevertheless, he and Lorentz both argued that there was value in maintaining the belief in a true absolute rest frame, and this point of view has continued to find adherents down to the present day."

Yes, it is hard to shed long held notions.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 00:15, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

::Today, the primary meaning of the phrase is that, given a specific burst of light, the burst's speed is measured to have the same numerical value in all inertial frames. That is, the speed is constant with respect to changes in the reference frame in which it is observed.
::A secondary meaning also exists: in any given frame, bursts of light from sources with different velocities all have the same speed. That is, the speed of light is constant with respect to changes in the source’s velocity.
::When the typical contemporary textbook uses the phrase, "the constancy of the speed of light," it intends that both the primary and the secondary meaning apply.
::In the years immediately preceding 1905 and in Einstein's seminal paper, the phrase, "the constancy of the speed of light," meant ''only'' that the speed of light is independent of the source's velocity.
:: . . . .
::To derive the Lorentz transformation, Einstein ''used'' only the principle that the speed of light is independent of the state of motion of the emitting (or reflecting) body and the relativity principle (the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames).
:: . . . .
::To take as a postulate that the speed of light is constant relative to changes in reference frame is to assume an apparent absurdity. . . . No wonder, thinks a student, that we can derive other absurdities, such as time dilation and length contraction, from the premises. Far better to start much closer to where Einstein started and to ''derive'' the logical consequence that the speed of any given light pulse has the same value in all inertial frames.

OK, I downloaded Prof. Baierleins' paper.  Having reflected on our previous discussions and then quickly reading this paper, I believe I can better summarize my position on this.  I agree that Einstein phrased the 2nd postulate in a way that is more restricted than the modern phrasing.  And, I agree that the modern phrasing of the postulate is actually is a logical consequence of the original 1st and 2nd postulates.

However, I would like to point out that the following statement in Prof. Baierleins' paper:

"Second, Einstein wrote, 'Now, we have to ''prove'' [my italics] that, measured in the moving system, every light ray propagates with the speed V [we would write c]...'".

cannot be used as a evidence that Einstein was here proving the modern form of the 2nd postulate.  As I have pointed out above, it is my opinion that here, Einstein is showing that the derived transformation equations are consistent.  That is, in deriving the transformation equations, he writes:

:<math>\xi = c \tau</math>..."

Recall that these are the coordinates of the moving system.  Thus, Einstein is explicitly saying that the propagation velocity of light is c in both the stationary and moving coordinate systems.  Since this is 'built in' to the transformation equations, why would he later need to prove this?    

In any event, there is no need to 'prove' the modern form of the 2nd postulate in his paper at all as it is an immediate and logical consequence of the original 1st and 2nd postulates.  Instead, Einstein needs to show that these postulates are not contradictory by demonstrating that there is a non-trivial transformation between the coordinate systems that is consistent with the postulates.

: No GRT is needed for this analysis: SRT has no problems with describing the behaviour of moving objects in a single inertial frame!

The cruvature of the disk depends on the speed. The ratio of radial distance along the curved shape to the circumference depends on the rotation speed. It appears he has not considered (on top of that) the deformation due to the stresses which supply the centripetal forces. (real disks have a limited rotation speed before the material yiled stress is reached). Ives's analysis is all from an interial frame POV using the length contractions. No GR involved.

:Look at section 10 of "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies".

Two: Could someone tell me why, when two bodys are experiencing motion relative to one another, time compresses for one clock, but not for another? That is, why, after the bodies become at rest with respect to one another, is one clock objectively slower than the other?
[[User:SJCstudent|SJCstudent]] 01:23, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, if both bodies decelerate identically until there is no relative motion between them, their clocks will be synchronized (assuming they were synchronized when they were instantaneously co-located).  A moving clock appears to run slow.  Accelerated clocks actually do run slow.

== 2nd postulate update ==

The current version of the special relativity "Postulates" section 
contains the following statement:
"An observer attempting to measure the speed of light's propagation 
will get the same answer no matter how the observer or the system's 
components are moving."

Apparently, that particular sentence was given by User:Christopher 
Thomas, who is currently on intermittent sabbatical. (As far as I 
could see, here is when he added said sentence: 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special_relativity&oldid=29065883 Thomas link]
- the page as of 16:44, 23 November 2005)

Here is the problem with the given sentence:
"Measure" means "To ascertain the quantity of, using standard 
measurement instruments."  Since the round-trip light speed 
case was closed prior to special relativity, this left only 
the one-way case for postulation; however, it is currently 
impossible to measure the one-way speed of light. Specifically, 
it's not possible (currently) to measure light's speed between  
two clocks.

Here is a suggested replacement for the second postulate 
section:
 
2. Second postulate - In empty space, light's round-trip, 
one-clock speed is c per experiment, but no one has yet 
measured light's one-way, two-clock speed due to the lack 
of absolute clock synchronization; therefore, the one-way 
speed of light was simply defined to be c to follow Einstein's  
assumption that inertial frames should not be distinguishable.

Since even Einstein agreed that light's one-way speed would 
'''vary''' given (absolute) synchronization, his other (hidden) 
assumption was that (absolute) synchronization is impossible, 
although he did not prove this. Indeed, since one cannot prove 
such a negative, the one-way case remains open, and can only 
be closed if and when (truly) synchronous clocks are used to 
actually '''measure''' light's one-way speed.
[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:31, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:In the "Status" section it is mentioned that the speed of light is understood two be the two-way speed. I think there should be no change in the "Postlates" section, because only two-way speed can be measured, there is no way to conduct "absolute synchronization". [[User:Icek|Icek]] 18:16, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

As I mentioned, at the time of relativity's creation, there 
could not have been any postulation regarding light's round-trip 
speed (because that case was '''closed''' via experiment); 
therefore, the second '''postulate''' could not apply to the 
round-trip speed of light, but could only apply to the one-way 
speed.

As I also mentioned, the one-way case remains open due to the 
possibility of absolute clock synchronization.  (It remains 
possible because no one can prove that it is impossible.)

To reiterate, Einstein did not postulate regarding the 
round-trip case, but simply accepted the null result as 
an experimental fact.  This left only the one-way case, 
and his postulate in that case was "Since my [Einstein's] 
rule is ''null results always,'' I postulate that clocks 
should be set to obtain a one-way null result, even if it 
means that they are not absolutely synchronous."
[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:48, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

:Being experimentally tested and ''not falsified'' does not contradict being used as a theory's postulate - the experimental evidence was the basis of the theory. The first postulate is also well-supported by experiments. In [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ Einstein's original publication], simultaneity is actually defined by synchronization by light signals (emitted in the same reference frame, as I understand it). So I agree partly, the definition of simultaneity should be in the article. But I don't think of it as a hidden assumption but rather as a mere definition and as such cannot be tested. If someone finds a way for instantaneous communication and thus absolute synchronization, it would, if one accepts Einstein's definition, allow for communication backward in time in certain reference frames. [[User:Icek|Icek]] 23:49, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

Thank you, Icek, for your comments. Just for the sake of the argument, let's say that you are correct about the round-trip case, i.e., that it ''was'' a part of the 2nd postulate at the creation of special relativity; this still leaves the problem of the one-way case.

By "the one-way case," I mean (as did Einstein) the specific case where light's one-way speed is measured by two clocks which are neither rotated nor transported.

In other words, the part of the second postulate that addresses light's one-way
speed says that whenever two mutually-at-rest clocks are used to measure this speed, it will be c (in all frames and in all directions).

Icek, would you be so kind as to tell us how this one-way experiment could be done.  You can even use the ideal clocks and rulers of theoretical physics.  Please show each step, starting with two unstarted clocks.

The relevant sentence from Einstein's paper:
:We have not defined a common "time" for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish ''by definition'' that the "time" required by light to travel from A to B equals the "time" it requires to travel from B to A.

Einstein did not explicitely state that the light should be emitted in the rest frame, but I think this is implied since many physicists in 1905 still thought that velocities simply add up.

Taking into account the definition of simultaneity, a one-way experiment can actually be done:
* Leave one clock (A) at the coordinate origin (which shall be at the starting point of the clocks). Take the other clock (B) to distance x, as measured by ruler.
* Now both clocks are at rest. Start clock A and at the same time send a light signal toward clock B. When it arives at clock B, set clock B to time x/c and start it. By definition, the clocks are now synchronized. It should be noted that the light signals where emitted in the rest frame.
* Now let a spaceship fly by clock A with velocity v. When it is at the position of clock A, it shall send a light signal toward clock B. Record the sending and arrival times and subtract one from the other.
* Divide x by the time difference to get c(v), the one-way light time.

::Now let's click our heels, and go back to Kansas! ;-) Nice try, Icek! (Seriously!)  But now that we are back in Kansas, let's focus on your word "experiment"; by definition, an experiment is an attempt to discover the nature of Nature, so there can be no rigging of the result by man; however, in the case you cited above, man '''rigged''' the result ("c invariance/isotropy") by forcing the clocks to obtain "c" (in the form of using the rigged "time" "x/c").

::Yes, I know that you used a different source for the second light ray, but since experiment says that light is source-independent, this matters not.

::It also matters not what the 2nd postulate says about the round-trip case because that case was closed experimentally prior to special relativity. (That is, special relativity has no unique position re this case because '''every''' theory must have a null result for it.) It is only the one-way case that really matters. It is only regarding that case that special relativity (SR) can take a unique position.

::And that unique SR position is exactly (and only) what the Wiki SR story should tell.

::What, specifically, does SR say about the only case that matters? 

::What, specifically, does SR say about the case where a light ray's speed is experimentally measured between two same-frame clocks sans rigging?

::For example, does the Wiki SR article say that the one-way case is still open? 

::For another example, does the article state that no one has ever actually used two same-frame clocks to measure light's one-way speed?

::For yet another example, does the Wiki article say that Galileo and Newton and Lorentz have not been proved wrong in the only case that matters? 

::And here is yet another example: Does the article state that one-way light speed invariance has not been shown, and '''cannot''' be shown (experimentally)?
::[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 01:53, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

I agree that the article should be changed.

There is indeed the hidden assumption that light propagation is isotropic and c is invariant in ''at least one reference frame when the light is emitted in this same reference frame''. Else the definition of time could lead to contradictory results.
But if we accept that, time is no longer "rigged", it's just a ''definition''. Maybe we should include the hidden assumption in the article.
[[User:Icek|Icek]] 15:13, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

::You've confused me with your word "invariant"; normally, "invariant" means "the same for all frames," and yet you mentioned only ''one'' frame. 

::You also confused me by reverting to your prior position of bringing up whichever light source emits the light, as if that makes any difference.

::You have further confused me by your statement that "the definition of time could lead to contradictory results"; please explain this.

::If Einstein's time is just a definition, then what has it got to do with the physics of space and time? Why not explicitly state that it is merely a definition given by man in lieu of absolute synchronization, which we (Einstein) cannot obtain.

::Can Einstein claim that the results a mere definition are laws of physics? (I am talking about the standard SR results such as c invariance, the transformation equations, and the composition of velocities theorem.)

::Why does the Wiki 2nd postulate section not say that it is currently impossible to experimentally measure light's one-way speed?

::Why does the Wiki 2nd postulate section not say that the only way to correctly measure light's one-way speed is to use absolutely synchronous clocks (but Einstein does not have such clocks)?
::[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:20, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

I should clarify a few things:
* When I answered at 18:16, 11 April 2006, I had not taken into acount a proper definition of time, so let's ignore that answer, since I have thought more about the problem afterwards.
* "Invariant" is probably not the right word in my last answer, a better word would be ''constant''. The statement means that there exists (at least) one reference frame (which I will subsequently call the rest frame) for which the two-way light trip time only depends on the distance, provided that the light is emitted in the rest frame.
* It should be clear now that if the two-way light trip time does e. g. also depend on the direction of the light beam there could be a different times at clock B depending on whether you synchronize it directly with a light signal from A to B or you synchronize it via a "relais" clock C which does not lie one the line passing through A and B.
* Every physical concept is "just a definition". Definitions aid us in describing the world. The definition of a quantity should include a method for measuring that quantity. How would one define "absolute time" or "absolutely synchronous clocks"?
* Definitions may rely on assumptions as I showed above for the case of relativistic time.
* Definitions cannot be disproved, but underlying assumptions can be, and this would make the definition unuseable.
* In relativity, only synchronization is defined, but not local time (we are speaking of "clocks" without specifying how they measure time). In physics, (local) time is currently defined by a resonant frequency of the caesium atom.
* The definition of time in relativity allows us to measure one-way light trip times for light emitted in other reference frames than the rest frame.
* In contrast to the definition of time, the postulates of special relativity can be tested.

[[User:Icek|Icek]] 12:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

::Let's touch on three of your just-given points.

* The definition of time in relativity allows us to measure one-way light trip times for light emitted in other reference frames than the rest frame. 

::Please remember that "measure" does not include rigging the result, and as we all know, Einstein's definition of "time" certainly does that. (It does it by presetting (rigging) the clocks to read the prechosen time "x/c" - as I have already mentioned.) 

* In contrast to the definition of time, the postulates of special relativity can be tested. 

::So tell us how we can test Einstein's second postulate. (That is, how can we experimentally test whether or not light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks is invariant?  Please show all steps, starting with two unstarted clocks.)

* Every physical concept is "just a definition". Definitions aid us in describing the world. The definition of a quantity should include a method for measuring that quantity. How would one define "absolute time" or "absolutely synchronous clocks"? 

::You seem to think that there is no definition of absolute time or absolute clock synchronization. Einstein himself gave two very good definitions of absolute synchronization, to wit:

[Quoting Einstein:]
"This is what is meant when we say that the time of classical physics is absolute: The simultaneity of two definite events with reference to one inertial system involves the simultaneity of these events in reference to all inertial systems." [Appendix V of <u>Relativity</u>] [sentence order reversed and colon used]

[Quoting Einstein:]
"w is the required velocity of light with respect to 
the carriage, and we have
 
w  = c - v.

The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative 
to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c.

But this result comes into conflict with the principle 
of relativity...."
http://www.bartleby.com/173/7.html

::Sure, Einstein (baselessly) rejected the result as being wrong, but the point is, he did <u>derive</u> it, so it could happen, at least on paper, and by this simple example Einstein told us that absolutely synchronous clocks would find that light's one-way speed varies with frame velocity, thereby giving us a definition of absolutely synchronous clocks.
[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:45, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

On absolute synchronization: I don't see a definition, i. e. how would you theoretically "absolutely synchronize" two clocks which are not at the same location?

:The logical flaws were given above, but it seems that I must now repeat them.

You wrote: 
* The definition of time in relativity allows us to measure one-way light trip times for light emitted in other reference frames than the rest frame.

You wrote:
* In contrast to the definition of time, the postulates of special relativity can be tested. 

::Please back this claim by showing step-by-step how the 2nd postulate can be tested. As we know, the 2nd postulate pertains to the one-way speed of light (saying that light's one-way speed per two same-frame clocks is invariant and isotropic), so this is essentially the same problem as above where I asked you to supply the date and experimenters.

::Tell us how the 2nd postulate applies to anything in physics.
[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 20:44, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

::: I partly disagree: as Einstein pointed out, both postulates were ''based on experience''. Moreover, the one-way speed of light can indeed not be determined except by convention, while physics theories are about what ''can'' be determined experimentally. Thus the second postulate is primarily concerned with the (experimental) ''round speed'' of light. It sets the constant c in the LT. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:56, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

::::The elapsed time required for light to propagate along a closed path can be measured by a single clock where synchronization is not an issue.  It is my understanding that experiments show that the length of the closed light path divided by the elapsed time is the constant speed ''c''.  Now, consider an experiment whereby light is sent along a path towards a reflector oriented to reflect the light back along the incident path.  Is it not true that the electromagnetic traveling waves that are the incident and reflected light superpose to produce a familiar standing wave pattern of stationary nodes and anti-nodes?  But, if the incident light propagates at a different speed than the reflected light, the nodes and anti-nodes will not be stationary but will instead move in the direction of the 'faster' light path, right?  The speed with which the nodes move, in conjuction with the result that the closed path average light speed is ''c'', can be used to calculate the one-way speed of light for the incident and reflected paths.  Of course, if the nodes are stationary for all orientations and states of uniform motion of the apparatus, then one-way light speed must be ''c'' which would imply that the notion of absolute synchronization of spatially separated clocks is without meaning.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 00:47, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

:::::Alfred, I also thought so once, but after thorough calculation it turned out to be not so.

One can't invalidate the Lorentz transformations with such simple tricks. ;-) [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 11:15, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

Just try it for yourself (I did). Or (to get back to what this page is supposed to be about!), give a reference to a peer reviewed paper that found another result. 20:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC) 

Thanks for the input, Harald88 and Alfred, but we are losing focus here, and I would hate to see this simple discussion drag on forever!

Surely you admit that special relativity (SR) pertains to the case of the one-way light speed per two same-frame clocks. Surely you admit that SR states that this speed must be experimentally measured as c in all frames. Surely you admit that if this is not the case, then SR falls, regardless of round-trip nullness or node nullness or whatever.

However, as I have tried to get across, it is currently physically impossible to experimentally measure light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks. (This is why the one-way Michelson-Morley experiment has never been performed.)

Also (as I have also tried to get across), even Einstein admitted that two absolutely synchronous clocks would disprove SR by finding a variable one-way light speed, regardless of round-trip nullness or node nullness.

[''RE-Quoting'' Einstein:]
"w is the required velocity of light with respect to 
the carriage, and we have
 
w  = c - v.

The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative 
to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c."

Einstein did '''not''' disprove his w = c - v. He merely discarded it because he disliked it.

Even though SR ''must'' have one-way invariance, it cannot get it without forcing it to happen (by rigging the one-way time on the clocks), so SR's one-way invariance cannot exist experimentally. On the other hand, one-way variance ''can'' exist experimentally, if absolutely synchronous clocks are used to measure light's one-way speed.

So where does this leave the 2nd postulate?

It leaves it saying the following:

Since I, Einstein, firmly (but, to be honest, baselessly) believe in "all null results," I believe that clocks will not be properly related unless they are forced by definition to obtain "c" for light's one-way speed. Furthermore, I must assume that absolute synchronization is not possible because it can quickly overturn my theory.

Translation (again speaking as Einstein):
Although my clocks are admittedly not correctly related (i.e., they are not truly (or absolutely) synchronous), we must nevertheless accept their results (e.g., the transformation equations, the composition of velocities theorem, one-way light speed invariance) as '''meaningful parts of physics'''. But since I cannot prove a negative, I have to admit that it may be possible to absolutely synchronize clocks, thereby totally disproving special relativity, despite round-trip nullness or node nullness or whatever.

Cadwgan Gedrych, here's why I am not happy with the definition of absolute time: "Simultaneity" is not defined (presumably you don't accept the light signal definition, because then the absolute time just defined does not exist; that has been shown e. g. by GPS satellites).
You have yet to explain how any (simpler) alternative to special relativity explains Alfred Centauri's standing wave example; this example is really a better way to measure one-way light speed, voiding the "time-rigging" argument. It is a way to test the second postulate.
You did not point out any logical flaws in my arguments, you only urged me to show you that the experiments have already been done.

It is straightforward to show that, assuming only the homogeniety and isotropy of space and time and the principle of relativity, the most general space and time coordinate transformation mixes space and time coordinates. Further, this transformation has a scaling that depends on an invariant speed and the relative velocity between the coordinate systems. If we allow this invariant speed to go to infinity, the space and time components decouple to yield the Galilean transformation where the notion of absolute time and absolutely synchronized clocks actually means something. In this context, the 2nd postulate is simply the assertion that the invariant speed of this general coordinate transformation is c. 
Now, it has been claimed to be shown that, by experiment, the invariant speed of the universe can be determined. It occurs to me that although this experiment may not give the exact result (due to experimental error), it certainly can determine if the invariant speed is finite. If this is true, it follows that if this experiment gives a finite result, the notion of absolute time and thus, absolutely synchronized clocks, is without meaning and, rather than breaking SR, would simply change the invariant speed of the transformation equations.

:It has been said that I am pushing some sort of purely personal view; hopefully, the following will refute this:

:Here is why '''only''' the ''two-clock version'' of the 2nd postulate is the only version that's relevant: 

:Only the 2-clock, one-way version (as opposed to all other versions, e.g., the round-trip, one-clock version, the nodes version, etc.) contains Einstein's ''clock-setting procedure'', and this unique procedure controls all of the two-clock results of special relativity (SR).

:For example, it controls all one-way speed values in SR, including the most critical one, the one-way speed of light.

:For another example, it controls the relativistic transformation equations.

:For yet another example, it controls the composition of velocities in SR.

:It causes Einstein's relativity of simultaneity.

:It causes Einstein's "time dilation."

:It causes Einstein's "length contraction."

:It causes Einstein's "momentum variance."

:However, as critical as the one-way, 2-clock case is, this specific experiment has never been performed, not even on paper.

:That is, c invariance has never been shown, nor can it be shown!

:From this it follows that Galileo's one-way light speed variance has not been disproved.

:Here are two important things to be asked of any article that purports to pertain to the 2nd postulate:

:1. Does the article tell what the 2nd postulate says about the one-way, 2-clock light speed case?

:2. Does the article dare to mention that the one-way, 2-clock light speed case remains open?

:3. Does the article say that the one-way, 2-clock light speed case controls SR's results such as the Einsteinian transformation equations?

:4. Does the article state clearly that no one has ever measured light's speed from Clock A to Clock B?

:5. Does the article admit that Einstein's clocks are incorrectly related, so all of SR's 2-clock results are incorrect?

:6. Does the article admit that no one has ever disproved the Galilean transformation equations (taking into account clock slowing and length contraction, which were added by Lorentz)?

:7 Does said article explicitly state that light's one-way, 2-clock speed will vary with frame velocity if absolutely synchronous clocks were used instead of Einstein's absolutely asynchronous clocks?

:About the above points, 
:- Point 1: It was set by definition - in fact that convention was already commonplace, as Poincare indicated in an earlier article. A procedural definition isn't a postulate about physics, eventhough it appears that Einstein suggested so in his 1905 paper. 
:- Point 2: Regretfully the sources are either disagreeing or unclear. As this is an encyclopdia, we can't (not allowed!) do better. Still, according to http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0409105, Einstein reiterated in 1907 that "clocks can be adjusted in such a way that [OWLS] becomes [..] c". That's obviously not a postulate but a procedure, and it would be helpful if the article cites that. 
:- Point 3: If you mean the Lorentz transformations: they are indeed dependent on that convention, but SRT's results are not (read for example the above arxiv article to understand why). 
:- Point 4: covered by point 2. 
:- Point 5: "incorrect" is a misnomer for a definition. 
:- Point 6. That Lorentz developed the LT based on the GT can be found in the corresponding links. 
:- Point 7: It may be enlightening to mention the fact that in GPS the speed of radio waves relative to the (moving) satellite is not c, and that that in no way contradicts SRT.

Surely, Harald88, you have seen this Einsteinian statement, and just as surely, Harald88, you know that it is ''not'' a closing velocity, but is simply a direct, two-clock measurement of light's one-way speed, given in the context of a single inertial frame in classical (Galilean/Newtonian) physics.

Please, Harald88, do us all a favor, and show how Einstein derived that simple equation "w = c - v" if you can. 

The payoff for such a small act would be huge: You will then fully understand Einstein's 2nd postulate!

: I have already tried to explain to you here above that that relative velocity ''is'' a two clock measurement in which the speed of light has been "set" to be uniformly c relative to the frame of choice; and I do understand Einstein's 1905 derivation (there is a minor glitch of no relevance in it, which was discussed about one year ago (or two?!)) on sci.physiocs.relativity. And ''that'' is the place for such opinion discussions, not here. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:09, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

:::Einstein, in VI of "Relativity" applies the (then standard) addition of velocities theorem to a man walking (with speed w) inside a train car (moving with speed v) to calculate the speed of the man relative to the embankment:  W=v+w.  Then, in the next chapter entitled "The apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity", Einstein employs the same theorem to light propagating at ''c'' relative to the embankment:  w = c - v.  (hmmmmmm - I'm still waiting for my huge payoff..................... nope - no payoff here).  Look's like Einstein straightforwardly applied the Galilean addition of velocities theorem.

:::He then says that this is in conflict the the (restricted) principle of relativity.   Why?  Because, at the beginning of the same chapter, he refers to the 'simple' law of physics that light propagates at ''c'' in the vacuum.  He also says this:  "The assumption that the velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction 'in space' is in itself improbable."  So, in 1916 when Einstein wrote this "popular exposition" as "A clear explanation theat anyone can understand", he non-rigorously explains that (a) the Galilean addition of velocities theorem yields a speed of light that can be essentially any value, (b) EM theory says the speed of light is ''c'', (c) physical observations indicate this speed does not depend on frequency (color) or the motion of the emitting body, and (d) that the notion this speed is direction dependent is improbable.  Do you believe that this 'laymans' relativity explanation should reveal to us that the 2nd postulate is whatever it is you think it is?  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 21:30, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

If I might throw my two cents into this debate, I might point out that it is possible to "measure" the speed of light in two different frames without needing synchronized clocks or such.  According to the first postulate, "...the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good", or more coloqiually all the laws of physics are valid in all inertial frames, including as insinuated in the above quote, the laws of electromagnetism, usch as Maxwell's Equations.  By testing the strength of the electric and magnetic interactions, one can get (or confirm or whatever) the values of <math>\mu_0</math> and <math>\epsilon_0</math>, the permeability and permittivity of free space, respectively.  The speed of light in vacuum, however, is <math>c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}</math>.  This measurement does not require any two-way trips (or much of any trip whatsoever).  Thus the speed of light is constant for two observers in inertial frames of reference, no matter how measured.  Indeed, this is the reason why some people consider the second postulate redundant - it's included in some sense in the first one.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 23:10, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

::::None of you found the payoff because none of you told how the clocks were set during Einstein's derivation of his w = c - v. I, too, am getting tired of this discussion - it is not worth the effort - let Wiki remain clueless re the truth of the 2nd postulate.

Neither of you hit the target, so the payoff eluded you both.

There is only one way to hit the target, and that is by simply telling us how Einstein's clocks are temporally related. A bonus can be won by then going on to tell us how Galileo's clocks' temporal relationship compares with Einstein's.

== The debate over second postulate ==

I was skimming through the long debate above over the wording of the second postulate. I feel it arises from a misinterpretation of how Wikipedia works. The wording of the second postulate in the article does not depend on which postulate is "right", but which postulate is sourced. [[WP:V]], [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:CITE]] tell us that we must attribute statements of controversial points to reputable sources. You can say "Einstein stated the second postulate thus, but recently researcher X disputed this in a paper published in a peer-reviewd journal(citation here)". You can not say "Einstein stated the second postulate thus, but editors after debating in the talk page of this article have arrived at the conclusion that Einstein was wrong." The debate can only be a purely academic one without any consequences to the article.

On the other hand, if a researcher has claimed a different version of the second postlate in a paper, then the claim should be included as a claim with proper citations irrespective of whether his claim can be said to be valid or not. Wikipedia is not the place to judge the merits of a scientific theory, we must only judge whether we cna provide sources for the theory. I hope the dispute is either resolved or continued with the understanding that its results will not have a bearing on the article. [[User:Loom91|Loom91]] 06:01, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

:Dear "Mr. Loom91," the debate has indeed been long, but it need not have been.

:Anyway, since you seem to care a little, let's look back at the existing article's version of the postulate:

:[quoting the article:]
:"Most current textbooks mistakenly include a major derived result, that the speed of light is independent of the state of motion of the observer measuring it, as part of the second postulate. A careful reading of Einstein's 1905 paper on this subject shows that, in fact, he made no such assumption. The power of Einstein's argument stems from the manner in which he derived startling and seemingly implausible results from two simple assumptions."

:Note that it begins by ''countering'' most current textbooks. So much for your point about using proper sources! Note further that it says that "A careful reading of Einstein's 1905 paper ...." Whose "careful reading" was this? Was it some Wiki editor's? What does this do to the cited source? Moreover, note that the word "assumptions" was used in relation to the second postulate, whereas Einstein stated that he was not making an assumption about the nature of light, but was merely giving a definition.

:[quoting the article:]
:"One of the most highly counterintuitive of these results (and, as stated above, commonly included in statements of the second postulate), is that the speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is the same to all inertial observers. An observer attempting to measure the speed of light's propagation will get the same answer no matter how the observer or the system's components are moving."

:This omits the most important part of the second postulate. Einstein's version does not omit it. That important part is the fact that the speed of light between two clocks is ''given'' by definition, ''not'' measured.

:Why would a '''given-up-front-by-definition''' "result" be "counterintuitive"?

:Why does the Wiki article say "An observer attempting to measure the speed of light" when the speed was given up front by Einstein's definition?

:Since Einstein's definition is the only difference between Lorentz's theory and Einstein's, it seems that no article about the second postulate (and special relativity) could rightly omit a direct comparison of Lorentz's and Einstein's clocks. How do they differ? It is impossible to fully understand either special relativity or the second postulate until one knows the physical difference between Einstein's clocks and Galileo's/Newton's/Lorentz's clocks (in the critical case of two same-frame clocks).

:It may surprise you to hear that Einstein explicitly admitted that he could not measure time (in the case of two same-frame clocks), whereas Newton's/Galileo's/Lorentz's clocks ''could'' measure such time. But I saw no mention of this "perfectly-valid-source" fact in the Wiki article.
:[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 14:21, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

::Cadwgan, I disagree with much of what you claim to be true above.  Consider:

:::(1) The synchronization of clocks in ''a'' frame in which Newtonian mechanics is valid such that the speed of light is measured to be isotropic in ''this'' frame does not set the speed of light to ''c''.
:::(2) The observed one-clock result that the closed path average speed of light is ''c'' is simply that, an observed result that suggests a principle.  
:::(3) The postulate that the speed of light is ''c'' independent of the speed of the emitter ''when measured by the clocks in the frame so described in (1)'', while fixing the speed of light as ''c'' in this frame, does not imply that the speed of light is ''c'' in any other frame.  However, it does imply (2) in this frame. 
:::(4) The additional postulate that the ''changes of state in physical systems are not affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of co-ordinates in uniform translatory motion'', now fixes the speed of light at ''c'' in all coordinate systems that are related to the system defined in (1) by uniform translatory motion which clearly requires that clocks belonging to any of these other frames are synchronized according to (1)
:::(5) We now know that any synchronization procedure that is consistent with an invariant one-clock closed path average speed of light in any inertial coordinate system necessarily results in transformation equations that belong to a continous set of transformations with the Lorentz transformation at one end of the spectrum (OWLS absolute, simultaneaty relative) and the Selleri transformation at the other end (OWLS relative, simultaneaty absolute).
:::(6) Although the choice in synchronization procedure cannot affect the underlying physics, the Einstein synchrony choice (by design) leaves the form of Maxwell's equations unchanged in any inertial frame.
:::(7) There is no objective answer to the question of whether such information as in (5) and (6) rates a prominent position in this SR article but, IMHO, a link to a separate article is appropriate.
:::(8) Wikipedia doesn't need ''armchair'' editors.  Make your changes already or go on about your ''mission'' elsewhere.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 21:52, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

TO ALFRED:
I am not being an armchair editor.

Your above is utterly useless, as far as I can see; for example, it failed to address these two important questions, which I now must repeat, thereby adding unnecessarily to the length of this discussion:

[1] Why would a given-up-front-by-definition "result" be "counterintuitive"? 
[2]Why does the Wiki article say "An observer attempting to measure the speed of light" when the speed was given up front by Einstein's definition? 

Also, the article fails to tell us the difference between Einstein's and Newton's clocks, which is what the 2nd postulate is all about.

Moreover, you made no mention of this critical omission by the article:
Einstein's explicit admission that he could correctly measure any two-clock times, including light's one-way, two-clock speed.

And why the heck are you talking for Loom91, anyway??? Where did he go!!!

And as for me going ahead and changing the article, don't you think that that would be silly with absolutely nothing having been resolved here?

First, I will state my personal views regarding this debate. Then I shall hive my opinion about this article.

As I understand it, the statement that the propagation velocity of electro-magnetic waves is the same to all inertial observers is equivalent to the statement that it is the same irrespective of the motion of the emitting body, because a trivial Lorentz tramsformation of the inertial reference frame switches between the two. A textbook wouldn't be wrong unless it included BOTH these as postulates.

I also don't feel that Einstein DEFINED the velocity of light. He simply assumed the existence of one such velocity c invariant under inertial reference frame changes and then used this assumption to derive the mathematical expresssions for the Lorentz transformations. That this constant velocity is indeed the velocity of light comes from Maxwell's electro-magnetism. I do not understand what you mean by saying Einstein defined lights velocity and it can not be measured. The velocity of light can not be measured in meters or any units derived from meter because meter is defined in terms of c, but that has nothing to do with SR. Einstein does assume c to be a constant, but that doesn't stp an observer from performing experiments to actually verify that assumption. See [[Speed of light]] (FA).

Now for the article. I think we are to take [[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]] as the primary source of our information on the postulates of SR. Anything creative must be attributed. No saying second postulate is redundant or textbooks are mistakes without sourcing. I dug up an English translation of the paper and Einstein begins the paper by saying that c is indepent of the motion of the emitting bodies. We can't call the textbooks wrong, simply mention that they do not present the postulate in the form used by Einstein. Weasel words such as "a careful reading shows" have to go. If the second postulate is redundant, then that stement has to be attributed. In any case, what are the prefered versions of either party? [[User:Loom91|Loom91]] 06:43, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:To Alfred Centauri:
:I asked "Why does the Wiki article say 'An observer attempting to measure the speed of light' when the speed was given up front by Einstein's definition?" 
:You replied "You are claiming it is given by definition and I claim that you are wrong."

:It is not my claim, it is Einstein's statement. Here, for your reference, 
:is that statement:

:[From Section 1 of Einstein's 1905 special relativity paper:]
:If at the point A of space there is a clock, an observer at A can determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by finding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events. If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A, it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neighbourhood of B. But it is not possible without further assumption to compare, in respect of time, an event at A with an event at B. We have so far defined only an "A time" and a "B time." We have not defined a common "time" for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the "time" required by light to travel from A to B equals the "time" it requires to travel from B to A. Let a ray of light start at the "A time" ta from A towards B, let it at the "B time" tb be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A at the "A time" t'a.
:In accordance with definition the two clocks synchronize if
:tb - ta = t'a - tb.

:Did you see that not only is light's one-way, two-clock speed controlled by and given by the definition, but so are all other two-clock measurements in SR?

:Here is Einstein's subsequent statement of his 2nd postulate, which shows how it is directly affected by the definition:

:2. Any ray of light moves in the "stationary" system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body. Hence 
:velocity = light path/time interval
:where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in Section 1.

:Did you notice that the time interval for light's one-way, two-clock speed in special relativity is controlled by the definition in Section 1? 
:Cadwgan Gedrych 18:27, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

::To Loom91:

::If light's one-way speed invariance were given by anything in nature, such as Maxwell's equations, then Einstein would never had had to use a definition to make it so.

::Here is the relevant part of your cited source:
::"One consequence of the laws of electromagnetism (such as Maxwell's equations) is that the speed c of electromagnetic radiation does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting the radiation; thus for instance the light emitted from a rapidly moving light source would travel at the same speed as the light coming from a stationary light source (although the colour, frequency, energy, and momentum of the light will be shifted, which is called the relativistic Doppler effect). If one combines this observation with the principle of relativity, one concludes that all observers will measure the speed of light in vacuum as being the same, regardless of the reference frame of the observer or the velocity of the object emitting the light."

::Maxwell's c is not the c of the 2nd postulate because Maxwell did not use two clocks to measure light's speed, and yet the 2nd postulate pertains solely to light's speed between two same-frame clocks. Since this cannot be done sans some definition of clock synchronization, Einstein was forced to provide such a definition, and he did, as I pointed out above to Alfred Centauri.

::Yes, as your source says, it is of course true that the principle of relativity implies that all frames will find Maxwell's speed to be c, but, again, this has nothing to do with the 2nd postulate, which, as Einstein said, '''requires''' a synchronization definition. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

::Cadwgan:  I've already explained why your claims are wrong.  Restating your claims with quotes and all is unnecessary because I already understand why we disagree.  Your claims are illogical and your conclusions do not follow from the quotes you've given.  I've already stated why you wrong point by point based on the very same quotes you have used.  This is the basis of our fundamental disagreement and there is no reason for any further discussion between us regarding this.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 23:32, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

::If I might throw another two cents in, after going back and reading [[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]], I have to say that Einstein both stated that light "is always propogated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body", and apparently defined c in terms of the round trip speed.  In regards to the first of Einstein's statements, it is this that he calls his second postulate.  In regards to the second of his statements, regarding the round-trip speed of light, the last sentence in the sub-section taken up by it ("It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to the stationary system we call it `the time of the stationary system.'") that he was using the round-trip not to define the speed of light, but to use the already constant speed of light to define time intervals, and not the other way around.  Basically, I believe the second postulate simply is the assumption that to all observers, no matter how it is measured, the speed of light is always equal to c, whether measured via Maxwell's equations, using two clocks, or using one clock and a reflected beam.  This assumption was then plugged into the round-tip scenario to define time intervals for stationary clocks.  At least, that's how I read it.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 15:26, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

::: You read it correctly.  In fact, since the "two clock" experiment cannot be done without first synchronizing the clocks using a two-way exchange of signals, a case can be made that this "one-way two-clock" experiment is impossible to do (and ironically Cadwgan notes that impossibility below).  However, scientific proof and/or refutation cannot occur on the basis of an experiment that cannot be done.  So Cadwgan's concern is moot. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:57, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

Although the round-trip, one-clock light speed case was ''closed'' '''experimentally''' (for all practical purposes) decades ago, the one-way, two-clock light speed experiment (with both clocks in the same frame, nonrotating, and not moving relative to each other in order to avoid any possible clock slowing differences) has ''never'' been performed, not even on paper. Unless and until you know exacly why this is so, you will simply never understand either SR or its postulates. Sorry, but I tells it the way it is!

:: ''If light's one-way speed invariance were given by anything in nature, such as Maxwell's equations, then Einstein would never had had to use a definition to make it so.''
: This demonstrates a total lack of understanding of special relativity and even of how theoretical physics works on the part of Cadwgan.  After all, Maxwell's equations do suggest the invariance of the [[speed of light]] (''c'').  Given that suggestion, one can construct a theory based on it, and that is what Einstein did.  Cadwgan acts like Einstein created something unacceptably artificial, but in reality what Einstein did was to say "let us assume the [[principle of relativity]] and the invariance of ''c'' as emitted as a rule of physics, and see where it leads".  The result is a theory that is highly consistent with observation, such that those observations prove the invariance of ''c''.
: For that reason, there is a consensus of editors that Cadwgan's concerns are unfounded and that the article is not in need of his proposed modifications, which is why he is belly-aching here.  As for "disputes over what the content of this article should be": This is Wikipedia and there will always be someone who wants some content added or removed for whatever reason.  In fact, I recently revised the "Physics in spacetime" section and am also wondering if that material shouldn't be elsewhere as it is higly technical and makes the overall article less accessible.

"After all, Maxwell's equations do suggest the invariance of the speed of light (c). Given that suggestion, one can construct a theory based on it, and that is what Einstein did."

:It is demonstrably false that Maxwell's equations "suggest" one-way or even two-way (round-trip) light speed invariance or isotropy. The proof lies in the simple fact that even Maxwell himself, along with all other physicists of the day, firmly believed in a ''positive'' result for the Michelson-Morley experiment - despite the existence of Maxwell's equations. In other words, these equations have nothing to do with coordinate (ruler/clock) measurements of light's speed. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:57, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

.................Simple Math Derivation Needed..................

Even after deliberately disregarding all preceding and subsequent
words in the book, the fact remains that Einstein at one point
definitely derived the very simple equation w = c - v.

Here are his own words:
"w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage,
and we have w = c - v.
The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage
thus comes out smaller than c."
---------------http://www.bartleby.com/173/7.html---------------------
All I am looking for is one brave soul who will show this derivation.

''From Cadwgan Gedrych in this talk page:''

[Quoting Einstein:] "w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have

w = c - v.

The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c.

But this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity...." http://www.bartleby.com/173/7.html

''From kk on sci.physics Feb 2, 2006:''

Einstein said that the clocks of classical physics
would obtain the value w = c - v for light's one-way
speed (departing light ray). Einstein's clocks, on
the other hand, obtain the value c. Therefore, the
two sets of clocks differ.

How do Einstein's clocks differ from those of
Newton and Galileo?

You cannot understand the basics of SR without
knowing the answer to the above question.

''From Cadwgan Gedrych in this talk page:''

Since Einstein's definition is the only difference between Lorentz's theory and Einstein's, it seems that no article about the second postulate (and special relativity) could rightly omit a direct comparison of Lorentz's and Einstein's clocks. How do they differ? It is impossible to fully understand either special relativity or the second postulate until one knows the physical difference between Einstein's clocks and Galileo's/Newton's/Lorentz's clocks (in the critical case of two same-frame clocks).

''From Cadwgan Gedrych on sci.physics.relativity Mar 31, 2003:''

One-way light speed invariance cannot be a law of nature.
Thus, one-way light speed invariance cannot be a scientific
postulate. And since SR is based solely upon Einstein's
"postulate" of one-way invariance, '''SR is not a scientific theory.'''

== A serious 2nd postulate discussion (with all rules followed) ==

Please note carefully that I am not here to bash special relativity per se. (Feel free to fully ignore any words of mine which even seem to do that.)

I am here to point out the problems with '''the article's''' treatment of Einstein's second postulate:

'''Problem 1'''

Here is a direct quote from the article (re the second postulate):

"An observer attempting to measure the speed of light's propagation will get the same answer no matter how the observer or the system's components are moving."

The following shows the problem with this statement:

"Measure" can refer to using two same-frame clocks. 

It is a part of current human knowledge that no such experiment (i.e., the one-way version of the Michelson-Morley experiment) has ever been performed.

It is a part of current human knowledge that no such experiment (i.e., the one-way version of the Michelson-Morley experiment) has ever been performed, not even on paper, using the ideal rulers and clocks of theoretical physics.

The latter proves that it is currently impossible* to experimentally measure light's one-way speed between two relatively-at-rest clocks.  (If this cannot be done even '''on paper''' using ideal or perfect instruments, then it clearly cannot be done as an actual experiment.)

(*although by no means perpetually impossible - since absolutely synchronous clocks could easily do the job)

Those who think otherwise must prove it by showing on paper how  we can use  two ideal atomic clocks still in their shipping crates to measure light's one-way speed between them.

'''Problem 2'''

Here is another direct quote from the article (re the second postulate):

"One of the most highly counterintuitive of these results (and, as stated above, commonly included in statements of the second postulate), is that the speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is the same to all inertial observers."

As I noted above, it is currently not possible to experimentally measure light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks (which is the definitive one-way experiment), so it certainly was not possible in 1905; therefore, Einstein '''had to''' give the "result" via a mere definition of clock "synchronization." (He had to because there simply was no other way of obtaining a one-way, two-clock light speed result.)

I placed quotes around the word "result" because Einstein's "result" in this case was not an actual experimental result,. but was merely given up front by a mere definition of clock "synchronization."

The fact that Einstein gave a definition of clock "synchronization" that directly gives the "result" c for light's one-way, two-clock speed '''before''' the performance of any actual one-way, two-clock light speed experiment is certainly a part of current human knowledge.

It should now be obvious that, contrary to the Wiki view stated above, there is nothing counterintuitive about the "result" c in the definitive one-way case. In case it is still not obvious, think about it: It cannot be counterintuitive if was given up front via a mere definition. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 16:55, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

: Roundtrip speed is c and one way speed ''after'' [[Einstein synchronisation]] is c. And both this statements are equivalent. This was known and published in the times of Einstein and Reichenbach and is still valid and re-iterated today. In modern coordinate-free formulation the issue of Einstein synchronisation vs. consistent alternatives doesn't even arise, it's clear that it's only about the choice of coordinates. 
: Do you suggest that we re-word to the more correct but obscure sounding: 
: ''One of the most highly counterintuitive of these results (and, as stated above, commonly included in statements of the second postulate), is that inertal observes can choose their coordinate systems so, that the speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is the same to all of them.''

::I still fail to see how the article is discussed. A serious discussion according to Wikipedia would be to say "in [citation], expert X says that it is impossible to test the second postulate because of problem Y. Therefore we should reword the article to reflect the view expounded by X that "synchronization" is only used to mean "two-way synchronization". I don't buy anyone's statement that "it's obvious" as a reference. --[[User:Alvestrand|Alvestrand]] 19:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

::: You can cite Reichenbach all day long on this issue, but I don't think it should be phrased, that ''it is impossible to test the second postulate''. Because the second postulate, taken in the form ''Roundtrip speed is c'' or ''one way speed ''after'' [[Einstein synchronisation]] is c'' or ''For every initial observer there is a choice of foliation (co-ordinate system) which makes the non-coordinate-free formulation of Maxwell Equatations valid'' is testable and tested to great precision. Also the equivalence of Einstein synchronisation via exchange of light signals and by slow transport of clocks is testable (and tested, but I'm not sure about the precision). --[[User:Pjacobi|Pjacobi]] 19:33, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: I think that Cadwgan is at best [[troll]]ing on us.

Once you have accepted Einstein's second postulate, it is a given, but only then.  Also, I find this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus.  There has been plenty of experimental confirmation of SR, including a number which have validated the second postulate (such as the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]).  That this has not been done to Cadwgan's satisfaction is irrelevant.

Apparently, EMS has simply made up his mind, so there is probably nothing that anyone can do about that, but maybe others can see what EMS cannot, so I will now directly address EMS' above objections:

Of course the invariance of light's speed would be counterintuitive if found by experiment; EMS misread what I said, so he missed the point entirely, and then held that against me, calling for others to boycott me. What I did say was that a result that is given by man up front by mere definition (and '''not''' by any experiment) is not in the least unexpected or in any way counterintuitive. Einstein ''began'' by presetting his distant clock to read his  prechosen one-way "time" x/c, which, of course, results in the clock "finding" the value c for "light's one-way speed."

EMS wrote:
:"Also, I find this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus."

EMS finds it "to be bogus" only because (as in the just-given case) EMS simply failed to understand.

Here is precisely what he failed to understand in this case:

Before special relativity, there was Maxwell's equations, but despite being given these equations, every physicist on the face of the Earth firmly predicted a positive (non-null) result for the Michelson-Morley experiment (round-trip light speed ''variance'' with Earth's velocity). Thus, if Einstein had postulated re these equations prior to the MMx, then he would clearly have postulated variance, not invariance, along with every other physicist.  However, Einstein ''did not have to postulate'' pertaining to Maxwell's equations because they (as I just noted) ''pre-existed'' special relativity. Therefore, the second postulate does not postulate regarding Maxwell's equations.

Similarly, since the Michelson-Morley null result itself pre-dated special relativity, Einstein did not have to postulate about that result.

Indeed, in his 1905 relativity paper, Einstein specifically stated that he was simply accepting up front the experimentally-given fact of round-trip isotropy, and was also accepting round-trip invariance (because it was so closely related to the former).

Clearly, this left only '''one''' case about which Einstein could possibly postulate, and that case was the one-way, two-clock light speed case.

Since all roads lead to the truth, we can arrive at the just-given conclusion by using an entirely different path, as follows:

Let's say that the second postulate calls for 500 different things, one of which is the invariance and isotropy of light's round-trip, one-clock speed, another of which is the constancy of light's speed c (''not'' measured by a frame's rulers and clocks, but determined by using magnetic and electric fields) in space (as per Maxwell's equations), and yet another of which is the invariance/isotropy of light's one-way speed per transported clocks, and so on, until we reach "the invariance/isotropy of light's one-way speed per two same-frame clocks."

Let's now assume that 499 of the cases have been closed experimentally, some of them even prior to the creation of special relativity.

Just as we found above, we are left with only ''one'' case to which special relativity currently applies theoretically, so it is only this ''one'' case that is currently critical as far as the future of special relativity is concerned, despite EMS' above opinion that -

:He finds this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus.

In other words, if special relativity does not currently state specifically that light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks is "blah-blah-blah," then special relativity does not currently make any ''theoretical'' statement about light's speed.

The burning question now is What does special relativity state about light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks?

Does special relativity say that if this speed is experimentally measured, that it will be invariant and isotropic?

If so, then how can this experiment be performed, and why has it not been performed yet, not even on paper using ideal or perfect clocks and rulers?

It should be clear that if an alleged experiment cannot be performed even on paper using perfect instruments, then it cannot be performed in real life, which, of course, is why no one has performed it in real life.

And since no one here has shown how this critical experiment can be performed on paper, much less in real life, no one has shown how to currently test the second postulate re the only case that counts, the one-way, two-clock case.

The burning question now becomes Why can't we currently test the second postulate in the only case that currently counts?

The answer is as follows:

Because the second postulate says absolutely nothing theoretical about light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks except the following:

[a] Since absolutely synchronous clocks would yield a variable one-way light speed, and since Einstein's main rule is "No absolute motion detection by any means," we must assume that such clocks cannot be found, even though we cannot prove this negative, and 

[b] we must further assume that clocks are properly set only if they do not allow us to detect out motion through space, even though such clocks will not be absolutely synchronous, but will be absolutely asynchronous.

Now we can see the second postulate a little more clearly. For example, we can see why the word "currently" - as in "currently test" - was used above; it is because we ''could'' test the postulate if we could find a way to absolutely synchronize clocks.

But we can see a lot more. 

For example, a blind person can now see the fact that '''all''' two-clock measurements in special relativity are '''incorrect''' due to the absolute asynchronousness of Einstein's clocks. 

This means that SR's transformation equations are incorrect. It also means that the SR composition (or addition) of velocities theorem is incorrect, as well as all of the other two-clock results such as "time dilation" and "length contraction."

Most of all, it means that the SR "result" of one-way light speed "invariance/isotropy" is incorrect, so Einstein's prime rule is also incorrect, which, as was noted above, was "No absolute motion detection can possibly happen by any means." This is flatly contradicted  the simple fact that we could easily detect absolute motion (or motion through space) by using a pair of absolutely synchronous clocks to measure light's one-way speed.

But we can also see that Einstein did not disprove the Galilean transformation because Einstein did not (and could not) prove that absolutely synchronous clocks cannot exist.

And we can further see that one-way light speed invariance has not only not been shown experimentally, but cannot be shown experimentally because it cannot happen unless it has been given up front artificially (i.e., by man via definition).

In conclusion (for now):
As long as we cannot absolutely synchronize clocks, we are forced to live with incorrectly related clocks (such as Einstein's), so we are forced to obtain incorrect results, which of course are not valid physics results. However, Einstein's results are the best we can get since he mainly ignores only the actual (and different) light travel times in different frames, and light's speed is very great. But if we could get our hands on a pair of truly synchronous clocks, then we could instantly forget all about special relativity, and go about the much better business of making correct two-clock measurements. For example, as mentioned above, we could easily determine our speed through space by correctly measuring light's passing speed.   (None of the above lies outside current human knowledge.) [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:05, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:Who said it was impossible to absolutely synchronize clocks?  SR rules out such synchronization in frames moving with respect to each other, but Einstein went to lengths to show how two clocks in the same frame can be synchronized, and define what it meant for them to be synchronized.  This is done as follows.  Starting with two good clocks (atomic clocks, ideal clocks, what have you), in their crates if you'd like, one is chosen to act as a clock for the starting point, and set, and this clock will be called A.  The other, to be called B, is moved to the desired location of the second clock, at a known distance away from the first clock.  This distance can be determined by laying out rulers, keeping careful track of the motion of the clock to ascertain how far it has travelled, or any other method.  Then a signal is sent from clock A to clock B, containing the time at clock A.  Obviously, as this signal takes time to reach clock B, depending upon the method used to send it.  One could use the second postulate and use a light signal to send the information, but it is equally acceptable to have someone walk it over or any other method where the speed can be well known (for instance via Doppler shift to keep track).  However sent, the velocity and known distance are used to correct the time from clock A to account for passed time.  I should stress that time dialation or length contraction do not enter into the issue as both the speed and distance are obtained from the stationary frame of the clocks.  Clock B is set to the correct time thus calculated.  This setting can be checked between the two clocks, but we'll assume that the clock setters don't screw it up the first time or that the process is suitably automated.

:Then it would be necessary to check that the two clocks are indeed synchronized, so clock A sends a signal to clock B, let's say containing the time it was sent, then clock B sends a signal back to clock A, and clock A sends one last signal to clock B.  Assume that there is zero turnaround time, or that turnaround time is suitably accounted for.  Call the times at which the signals were sent <math>t_{A,0}</math>, <math>t_{B,0}</math>, <math>t_{A,1}</math>, and <math>t_{B,1}</math>.  Then, according to Einstein's synchronization procedure, the clocks are synchronized if <math>t_{B,0} - t_{A,0} = t_{A,1} - t_{B,0} = t_{B,1} - t_{A,1}</math>.  This is how one synchronizes two clocks in the same frame.

:So, then verifying the second postulate becomes simple.  Exchanging light signals between the two synchronized clocks will do the job.  Sending a signal from clock A to clock B with the time it was sent from clock A contained therein (or sent along later).  Then the speed of light can be determined from knowing the distance between the clocks, determined during the synchronization process, and the time it took for the signal to propogate.  Similarly, the round trip speed of light can be confirmed from Einstein's synchronization condition.  That is, <math>c = \frac{2  x_{AB}}{t_{A,1} - t_{A,0}} = \frac{2  x_{AB}}{t_{B,1} - t_{B,0}}</math>.  Moreover, the condition that <math>t_{B,0} - t_{A,0} = t_{A,1} - t_{B,0} = t_{B,1} - t_{A,1}</math> is a proof for the isotropy of light speed.  From these confirmations, the second postulate, that "light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body", can be confirmed, and used to show that the speed of light is always just the speed of light.

:As to Maxwell, it is correct that his equations were known earlier than either Michelson-Morley or Einstein, and that knowledge of Maxwell's equations did not and does not automatically imply the second postulate.  Indeed, the fact that the speed of light (or more correctly the speed of EM-waves, which is what light is) did not depend upon any facet of any observer or frame was interpreted as evidence for the aether.  The aether would be the frame in which the speed of light was as in Maxwell's equations.  However, as history shows, the aether hypothesis ran into a great deal of trouble.  What Einstein did, particularly in his first postulate, was propose that Maxwell's equations, like Newton's laws, were the same for all observers in inertial frames.  So, in every inertial frame, the result of the equations that EM-waves and light would travel at the speed of light should need to hold true.  Otherwise, the first postulate could not be correct, as it would be possible to tell two inertial frames moving with respect to each other from each other by testing Maxwell's equations, testing the strength of the electric and magnetic interactions, and even measuring the speed of light.

:As to testing these predictions, and the second postulate, it should be pointed out that SR is in fact not strictly true.  It was superseded by General Relativity which complicates the picture.  We live in the middle of a gravitational field which is not uniform.  So there is a limit to the size of our "laboratory" for making a test.  Now, I'm far to lazy to look it up or do any calculations, but it may very well be that the "laboratory" length required to fully test the second postulate is too large to accomodate the assumption of an inertial frame.  So, if the second postulate has not been adequately tested, it may be due to these restrictions, and to restrictions in our ability to conduct such experiments.

:: DAG, your theory that it is "possible to absolutely synchronize clocks" is non-standard and disproved in a number of articles such as by Ives. See also the linked journal article by Rizzi. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 21:09, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:::Firstly, I should note that all this synchronization I propose takes place within one inertial frame.  It does not attempt to "absolutely synchronize" between two frames moving with respect to each other.  Once the two clocks are placed, the only things which move are signals.

:::Secondly, I do not see anything in the Rizzi article (presuming you were referring to http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0409105) that says my proposed scheme is wrong.  Indeed, it appears that what the paper goes on to show is that the "absolute" synchronization therein described is nothing but the special case of synchronization in one inertial frame, which is what I was attempting, and which is entirely valid.

:::Thirdly, all I have done is show how a system of synchronized clocks might be set up in one inertial reference frame.  I have worked to define the time element of the position four-vector inside this frame.  I have not said that time might be synchronized between two clocks in different inertial frames, nor that such a scheme implies absolute simultaneity between inertial frames.  All I have said is that conceivably, at each point in space, a system of synchronized, relatively-stationary clocks can be set up.  This is the whole point of Einstein synchronization, as the following statement from "...Electrodynamics..." shows:

:::"By means of stationary clocks set up in the stationary system and synchronizing in accordance with § 1, the observer ascertains at what points of the stationary system the two ends of the rod to be measured are located at a definite time. The distance between these two points, measured by the measuring-rod already employed, which in this case is at rest, is also a length which may be designated 'the length of the rod.'" (§ 1 is the section describing Einstein synchronization).

:::Fourthly, as to Ives, I have not read any of his papers, so a link/reference would be nice, though I would also note that he appears to have been significantly opposed to SR, even though at least one of his experiments is generally taken as confirmation of SR.  Again, there's not much I can say about this without seeing what he actually said.

:::I hope this reassures you that my proposal is entirely standard and was just a careful and canservative statement on how to build a network of clocks to define time in a single inertial reference frame.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 21:50, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: See for example the summary conclusion on p.45: ''we do not think that the one-way speed of light is a meaningless concept because it is not measurable; we simply think that the lack of observability allows a multiplicity of conventional assumptions, encapsulated in some synchronization gauge, which are consistent with any possible experimental evidence.'' And Ives was opposed to the popular interpretation (he roughly agreed with Langevin and not with Einstein), and he published a lot of high quality peer reviewed papers on the subject - but I now notice that Cadwgan provided links to more of such references, thus it's no use to look up unlinked ones, nor needed for us to explain it.

:DAG, "ol' boy," you went through your synch process a little too quickly. Let's slow it down a tad, as follows:

:Re your claims that clock slowing and ruler contraction are not involved: You did not prove that the clocks are not physically slowed. Experiment shows that clocks moving at different speeds have different intrinsic atomic rates. Also, you failed to prove that your standard ruler was not physically contracted. (The only way to show the MMx null result on paper is by using a physical length contraction, so this proof is clearly essential. Indeed, it would be essential even sans the MMx case because a "real physicist" must prove all steps.)

:You (DAG) wrote:
:"However sent, the velocity and known distance are used to correct the time from clock A to account for passed time."

:What "velocity" are you talking about? How was it measured? You already have the two possible error sources of intrinsic clock slowing and intrinsic ruler contraction which you did not take into account. How could you have possibly measured any velocity correctly at this point in the game?

:I took it for granted that everyone knew that the lack of absolute simultaneity in SR was the same as the lack of absolute synchronization. If Einstein could not determine whether two lightening bolts stuck absolutely simultaneous or not, then he certainly could not absolutely synchronize two clocks, even in a single frame.

:Indeed, here is what Einstein himself said regarding a ''single frame'' measuring the speed of a light ray. Einstein was so specific that he even specified a ''departing'' light ray:

:[Quoting Einstein:]
:"w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have
 
:w  = c - v.

:The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c.

:The point here is not what Einstein thought about this result, but that he '''derived''' it on paper, using two clocks in a single frame.

:As I said, the only way anyone can understand the second postulate is by discovering for themselves the physical distinction between two same-frame Galilean clocks (which Einstein used to get his w = c - v) and two same-frame Einsteinian clocks, which yield w = c in any frame in any direction. (Note that Einstein would have obtained w = c + v if he had specified an approaching light ray.)

:DAG, tell us the difference between Galileo's and Einstein's clocks.

:DAG wrote:
:"Now, I'm far to lazy to look it up or do any calculations, but it may very well be that the "laboratory" length required to fully test the second postulate is too large to accomodate the assumption of an inertial frame."

:Here you overlooked my prior statement that no one has ever shown even '''on paper''' (using ideal rulers and clocks) how to test the second postulate's (sole) theoretical prediction that light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks is c invariantly and isotropically.

:You also ignored my comments re Maxwell's equations. 

:You wrote:
:"... it would be possible to tell two inertial frames moving with respect to each other from each other by testing Maxwell's equations, testing the strength of the electric and magnetic interactions ...."

:As I noted, even Maxwell himself fully expected a positive result for the MMx. He could not have expected this given your above.

:Here is why he did not expect it:
:The interactions of magnetic and electric fields have always been frame independent, just the same as the interactions of a comb and a head of hair, or a back scratcher and a person's back. No one should have ever expected to detect their motion through space by using Maxwell's equations or the results of any magnetic/electric interactions, and no one did except a few such as DAG. ;-)

:Returning briefly to your synchronization process, let's assume that the ruler-measured distance between the two given clocks was 1 light-year. Let's then emit a light signal at the origin clock, which starts on zero, letting the signal travel to the distant clock. We will assume (as did Einstein) a one-way travel time of 1 year. Giving both you and Einstein the benefit of the doubt in this instance, I will agree that the clocks will be absolutely synchronized if the distant clock reads 1 year when it is struck by the light signal.

:However, if we simply add another frame or two, we can see instantly that no other frame's clocks can possibly be absolutely synchronized.

:The basis of this fact is the simple fact that we can use the same light source for all other frames due to light's source-independence.

:Picture a second frame whose x axis is parallel to that of the first frame, with their origin clocks coincident when the light signal is emitted there.

:Although both origin clocks are absolutely synchronous because they both read zero at absolutely the same time, we can't say the same about the two distant clocks.

:Indeed, we ''can'' say for certain that they get "hit" by the light signal at absolutely different times because nothing - including a light signal - can be in two places at once. (Besides, all observers in all frames ''see'' one clock get "hit" when the other clock is ''not there,'' which proves that they were "hit" at absolutely different times.)

:We have already given the "hit" time for the first frame's distant clock, namely, T1 = x/c.

:We now can see that the "hit" time for the second frame's distant clock cannot be T1 = x/c, but instead must be T2 = T1 + T?, where T? is the unknown time for the light signal to travel between the two spatially-separated distant clocks.

:Unless light's speed is infinite, T? must be >0.

:But DAG's overly-quick analysis did not even mention other frames.

:As I said, it is time to get serious here, and getting serious means using in-depth analyses.

:I have just proved that Einstein's clocks cannot be absolutely synchronous except in one frame (among all frames whose x axes are parallel).

:As I mentioned, it is not possible to obtain correct results by using absolutely asynchronous clocks.

:Some may see this as "SR bashing," but I see is as just calling a spade a spade, and I have the proof to back it up, unlike DAG.

:How does this proved conclusion relate to the article? It tells us in no uncertain terms that it is currently not possible to correctly measure any one-way, two-clock speed, including light's one-way, two-clock speed, which is the only speed to which the second postulate can pertain to theoretically, as I have noted.

:In contrast, the article implies that a correct measurement is possible, and that the correct result would be c.

:Contrast this with Einstein's own claim that the result would be c - v given the absolutely synchronous clocks of classical physics.

:Finally, let me repeat the fact that no one has ever even shown on paper (using perfect clocks) how we can currently experimentally measure light's one-way, two-clock speed, so the article is simply wrong to imply that such a measurement can be made today.

That is the closing rate of light in a frame of reference with respect to an object moving in the same direction as the light at a speed of ''v''.  Cadwgan is being very cleaver and lawyerly, using any statement that he can get his hands on as a basis for refuting SR.  For example, in [[user_talk:Cadwgan Gedrych|his own talk page]] he acknowledges in one paragraph that the second postulate explains the Michelson-Morely experiment null result, and a little later asks me to describe how SR explains that same result as if it does not.

:::::As to criticism of my procedure, I'd like to point out that I really shouldn't have called it "absolute synchronization".

A single picture shows the entire experiment: 
 (Key: a clock reading -.6 is shown as [-.6].)

 Primed Frame            x=1  
 [0]--------------------[-.6]---> 
 E2                       E1 
 [0]--------------------[+.6]<--- 
 Unprimed Frame          x=1

Note that - as was said above - the unprimed frame's origin clock reads zero as event E1 occurs at t = 0.6 and at x = 1.

All readings and distances are given per the relativistic transformation equations.

Contrary to Dirk, no clock which reads two different times at once.

EMS wrote:
:"What is bogus is the assertion of Cadwgan that ''Einstein's own claim that the result would be c - v''.  That is the closing rate of light in a frame of reference with respect to an object moving in the same direction as the light at a speed of ''v''."

It is not a closing speed. Einstein clearly stated that it was the speed of light relative to the carriage. There is no object involved. But this does not really matter. 

:: I will stand corrected on this count.  I went to find the ''c''-''v'' reference, and succeeded.  It is in {{cite book|last=Einstein|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Einstein|title=Relativity:The special and general theory|year=1956|origyear=1916|publisher=Bonanza Books|chapter=section VII|pages=p. 18|id={{ISBN|0-517-025302}}}}.  As it tuns out, Cadwagan awas right: Einstein was describing the speed of light.  However, he is doing so ''under the rules of classical mechanics''.  It may be instructive to note that the title of this section is "The apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity".  It should also be noted that at the beginning of the following paragraph Einstein states: "''But this [c-v] result conflicts with the principle of relativity ...''".   So Cadwgan claiming that Einstein says that the speed of light is ''c''-''v'' is just plain deceitful. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 03:48, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

What does matter is this:

The Galilean transformation, which was derived using clocks and rulers, just as was the Einsteinian transformation, and yet the former has a variable one-way, two-clock light speed, whereas the latter has an invariant one-way speed.

Neither EMS nor Dirk can tell us how Galileo's clocks physically differ from Einstein's.

Therefore, neither of them can tell us why the clocks get different results.

I challenge them to fill in these blanks:

 Galileo's clocks:
 [??]----------1 light-year-----------[??]

 Einstein's clocks:
 [??]----------1 light-year-----------[??]

(speeds can be supplied to suit your taste)

Smoke and mirrors. Neither Dirk nor EMS could tell us how Galileo's clocks differ from Einstein's. And yet this is essential to any sort of understanding of the difference between classical and Einsteinian flat space-time physics!

I do wish to thank EMS for his clarification re the w = c - v, as far as it went; but it quickly bogged down again. 

EMS said:
"It should also be noted that at the beginning of the following paragraph Einstein states: ''But this [c-v] result conflicts with the principle of relativity ...''.   So Cadwgan claiming that Einstein says that the speed of light is ''c''-''v'' is just plain deceitful."

If I am just plain deceitful, then how did I win my first case against the Wiki article?

If I am just plain deceitful, then how did I win all of my SR arguments in the Newsgroups?

It seems to me that it's EMS who's just plain deceitful because he omitted my prior statement here that it matters not what Einstein claimed about the validty his result w = c - v, but all that matter was the simple fact that Einstein ''derived'' this result on paper using two clocks.

I did not say that Einstein said that the speed of light is c. I said that he said that the speed of light would be and could be c given the absolutely synchronous clocks of classical physics.

This is not even hinted at in the Wiki article. 

I also said that the only reason we get c today is by definition, and this clearly has nothing to do with physics because it is untestable.

Let EMS tell us why no one has ever used two same-frame clocks to measure the one-way speed of light? This is clearly the definitive one-way light speed experiment, but it has yet to be performed, and the Wiki article fails to mention this extremely important fact, let alone tell us the why's and wherefore's!

EMS wrote:
": In his talk page, Cadwgan Gedrych wrote:

:: ''You claim above that things such as the MMx confirmed the second postulate. ... Yes, any null result is consistent with the second postulate''."

This also seems deceitful. Anyone here should know that merely "being consitent with" does not mean "physically explain by." 

Dirk pitifully attempts to cite essentially the same thing on two web pages to make his case look better, but he has no case at all.

Doesn't anyone here think it odd that Dirk has nothing to say about the topic at hand, namely, the second postulate?

Doesn't anyone here think it rather strange that Dirk has not simply pointed out which clock of the 4 reads two different times at once?

Doesn't anyone here think it weird that Dirk simply ignored my simple but critical challenge re Einstein's vs Galileo's clocks?

Doesn't anyone here think it sad that no one except Dirk "sees" an error in the  little 4-clock experiment?

Since Dirk continues to insist on posting off-topic, it seems that one way to put a stop to this is by challenging him to bring in at least one other person who agrees with him about the above-mentioned 4-clock case. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 13:57, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

Although I know that he "hated" to do so, I must thank EMS for calling Dirk's hand, so to speak. As we can all see, Dirk is not a fair-play person, and yet he is the only one from the entire Newsgroup world who has come here to jump on my case - baselessly - as we can see from any and all of his above.

I know EMS "hated" to defend me because he wrote:
"... with others of his [Cadgwan's] ilk I know how the type and I am sure that things have been explained to him many, many times before."

Although EMS is completely off-topic here, as far as the second postulate goes, I need to state that there are very few others "of my ilk" around. As I said, I am not on any troll or crackpot list, despite my push to reveal the full truths about special relativity. And absolutely nothing about SR "has been explained to [me] many, many times before." I would like to see a retraction and an apology from EMS, who has made serious but completely false allegations here.

: You are on Dirk's troll and crackpot lists, and most certainly are on my troll list.  Then again, beause of my opposition to black holes, I am on a number of crackpot lists myself.  I have nothing to retract, although I will offer you a weak apology for refering to you as "deceitful" and a "troll".  However, while I regret the necessity, I do see those labels an amply justified by your actions in this venue.  (Note however that I draw the line purely personal attacks, which is what Dirk gave you.)
: You rate a kudo from me for not rising to the bait and responding to Dirk on his own terms.  Let's just say that he is not this first mainstream editor to disgrace himself in dealing with a non-mainstream editor, although I see Dirk as being just plain rude and not a "mainstream crackpot" (and I do know of one).
: As for any specifics on SR and the two-clock experiment:  You have already tipped your hand.  ''You do not accept the second postulate as a description of physical reality.''  You therefore do not accept that this article is correct in treating SR as a description of physical reality.  You are screaming that this two-clock experiment is important, but have produced ''no citations'' in an respected publication where this is stated.  In the end, it is Cadwagan Gedrych/Brain Jones that is the source of the need for such an experiment, and using your say-so would violate [[WP:NOR]].  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

For example, why does the article fail to say that no one has ever used two same-frame clocks to measure the one-way speed of light, not even on paper? 
The second postulate certainly pertains to such a speed, as all books on special relativity certainly say or at least certainly imply. Indeed, it would be very hard to find a person anywhere who does not believe that light's speed from point A to point B is not c experimentally. And the same number of people firmly believe that the second postulate says that light's speed from point A to point B is c experimentally, or would be if the "experiment" were performed today, since it has yet to be performed, much to most folks complete surprise. Even more surprising is the fact that it ''cannot'' be performed today. And even more surprising is the fact that were it to be performed tomorrow, the result would not be in favor of the spirit second postulate; i.e., it would not be a null result because the only way to perform the one-way experiment is by using two absolutely synchronous clocks to measure the passing speed of light.

This is all simple and obvious and fully in the realm of current human knowledge, but the article does not even touch on it.

== Postulates section revert ==

Harald88 -

It is your "corrections" that were incorrect.  From [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies"], Einstein states the second postulate as "light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body".  Note that there is no reference to any round trip there.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:13, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:And some paragraphs abobe Einstein states:
:''...establish by definition that the ``time'' required by light to travel from A to B equals the ``time'' it requires to travel from B to A''
:So, the the part of the second postulate, which is not a tautology, is a postulate for measured round-trip speeds. Several authors, most notably Reichenbach, have clarified this point.

: I must correct myself, generally speaking the constant round trip speed follows from the synchronisation convention plus the first postulate.
: If one tries to make the three statememts (sync. conv, post 1, post 2), orthogonal, so that each one states only what is not already covered by the previous one, this would remain from the second postulate: ''Light emitted at point A simultanously by sources with different speeds arrive at point B simultanously.''
: OTOH it is somewhat unclear, whether a orthogonalized set of stattements is preferable to simple and concise form.

:: Actually, Einstein made clear (and this is noticed in a number of articles) that he simply postulated what was already accepted observations - the equivalence for observations of all intertial frames, and the roundtrip speed c (he ''defined'' c as roundtrip speed in that article, and pointed out once more in 1907 that the one way speed is only a stipulation, see again the reference that I added).

:::Einstein's synchonization procedure is, in his 1905 paper, explicitly given for one coordinate system only - the ''stationary system'':  "It is essential to have time defined by means of stationary clocks in the stationary system, and the time now defined being appropriate to the stationary system we call it ``the time of the stationary system.``".  In other words, he begins by assuming that the speed of light is isotropic in this system and sets his clocks to reflect that assumption.
:::The 2nd postulate, as expressed in his 1905 paper, sets the measured speed of light in the ''stationary system only'' to be ''c'':  "Any ray of light moves in the ``stationary system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c".  Now the round trip average speed of light is also ''c'' since, by assumption (definition?), the speed of light is isotropic in the stationary system.
:::But, and correct me if I'm wrong here, all of this applies to the stationary system ''only'' until the 1st postulate is invoked.  That is, Einstein synchronization in all coordinate systems related to the stationary system by uniform translatory motion follows because of the principle of relativity.
:::If, instead of the principle of relativity, we postulated that "what is simultaneous in the stationary system is simultaneous in all coordinate systems related to the stationary system by uniform translatory motion" and in addition, we enforced the observational result that the round trip average speed of light is ''c'' in all of these coordinate systems, would we not get the Sellari inertial transformation instead of the Lorentz transformation?
:::If this is true (and I'm not sure that it is), then it would seem to me that all this discussion about synchronization and the 2nd postulate is somewhat off target for the reason that it is the 1st postulate that governs the synchrony choice in the 'non-stationary' coordinate systems.  Thoughts? [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 14:05, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
:::: I would have to work the details, including looking into the Sellari transformations, but I can tell you that this alternate postulate will give you a different result.  Let's just say that the loss of the [[principle of relativity]] would have significant consequences, just as its being retained by Einstein in 1905 did.
:::: As for your musing about the second postulate discussions, you have hit the nail on the head:  You cannot establish absolute universal synchronization because the clocks in the "moving" coordinate system get synchronized in a way which is incompatible with way the clocks of the "stationary" coordinate system were synchronized. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:48, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:::In Harald88's last edit to the second postulate, he writes:  "What also many textbooks overlook is that the isotropy of the one-way speed of light was introduced by definition and not as postulate."  Yes, Einstein introduces the isotropy of the OWSL as a definition but, as I've pointed out above, this definition holds only in what he calls the stationary system of coordinates.  Further, the phrasing of the 2nd postulate in this article does not make it clear that, in Einstein's words, the 2nd postulate refers to the speed of light in the stationary system of coordinates.  In other words, Einstein assumes isotropic OWLS and the independance of ''c'' on the motion of the emitting body in '''a''' coordinate system.  It is only through the principle of relativity that this state of affairs is extended to all uniformly moving coordinate systems.  At least, this is how I read his 1905 paper.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 22:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: Alfred - You are basically correct in your reading of the 1905 paper.  As for Harald88 saying that the isotropy of the one-way speed of light is a definition instead of a postulate: I see it as both!  Here is a larger excerpt from the 1905 article:
::::: ''... [T]he same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good. We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the "Principle of Relativity") to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite [speed] c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.''
:::: Indeed, Einstein is ''defining'' the speed of light as being uniform and isotropic.  However, at the same time as Einstein makes this definition, he also assigns it the status of a postulate, since this definition is one of fundamental principle of the theory that he is about to describe.
:::: The real key to this business really is the first postulate, the [[principle of relativity]].  Even in aether theories the speed of light was expected to be uniform and isotropic with respect to the aether, and so the "stationary frame" for the aether was a preferred frame of reference.  However, in relativity, all frames of reference can potentially act as a "stationary frame".  Similarly, all frames can also have the role of a "moving frame".  Just remember that it is the Lorentz transformation that now describe how events as viewed in one frame of reference will be viewed in a different frame of reference.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The two-way result was given by experiment, and all Einstein did was to accept this result (incorporating it into SR). See his 1905 paper, noting carefully his words "In agreement with experience [experiment]"; these words were left out of the above quote, thereby completely changing its meaning. Einstein's word "assume" was necessary only because the second two-way experiment had yet to be performed, the one that tied down two-way invariance. (The first experiment tied down only isotropy.) Einstein, therefore, had to assume the former because he was given only the latter in 1905.

How does the second postulate require the OWLS to be constant? Are you talking about an experiment here? Are you talking about an experimental measurement of the OWLS? 
If so, then please tell us how this alleged experiment can be performed, if only on paper (using ideal rulers and clocks).[[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 14:27, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

Harald - The first posulate says nothing about Maxwell's laws.  it simply says that the rules of physics should be the same in all frames of reference.  The second postulate then declares that one of those laws is the invariance of the speed of light.  That Maxwell's laws are invariant under the resultant theory is a major derived result, which Einstein describes in the second half of the 1905 article.  I kindly counsel against adding anything to the statement of the postulates, but to leave them as Einstein stated them. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:Sorry to be negative, but you guys will continue to argue with each other about this until the simple truths are known here.

Here is a perfect example:

EMS wrote above:
"The second postulate then declares that one of those laws is the invariance of the speed of light."

I like EMS's vigour and obvious abundant interest, but I simply cannot stand by when he makes such a claim.

There are four distinct light speeds. To which one is EMS referring here?

[a] Maxwell's equations have a c. It is not a coordinate c, but was determined from the frame-independent relations between fields. Since it is frame-independent, it of course means that all observers in all frames find this c.

[b] The Michelson-Morley experiment has its own c. This is half of the full round-trip c, and it is the isotropic half. It was found sans any clocks, but rulers were involved, so it ''is'' a coordinate c.

[c] The Kennedy-Thorndike experiment experiment has its own c, and it is fully independent of both of the above. (In other words, despite the MMx null result, the KTx could have had a positive result.)

At the time of SR, Einstein considered [a], [b], and [c] closed cases - closed experimentally, just as they must be. He saw nothing about which to postulate concerning these three experimentally-closed cases. This left only the following case for his theoretical pleasure, so to speak:

[d] The very tricky one-way, two-clock case has its very own c, but has yet to have its very own experiment. This is the full coordinate case because it must involve both clocks (two minimum per frame) and rulers. (This case is tricky because it involves all the complexities of clock synchronization. One cannot measure light's one-way speed sans two clocks, and they must be temporally related in some way.)

Let's put EMS's above claim in terms of [d]:
"The second postulate then declares that one of those laws is the invariance of the one-way, two-clock speed of light."

(As we have seen, this is actually the ''only'' proper version of the postulate, 
but it is certain that the postulate cannot be ''devoid'' of this version; indeed, it is certain that this version is incredibly important to SR since it is the only ''open'' case out of all possible cases.)

I now ask EMS to explain how one-way light speed invariance can possibly be (or become) a '''law''' of nature. 

(It is now not a law of nature because it was given by mere man via a mere definition of clock "synchronization., a definition that admittedly does not absolutely or correctly relate clocks, so even the man-given or artificial result is not a correct one!)

In fact, I will go one step further by asking EMS to explain how there can be ''any'' law in the one-way, two-clock light speed case, much less the invariance law of which he spoke.

Here is the rationale behind this question:
Any law of nature must be given only by nature, with no part given or controlled by mere man; however, in the case of light's one-way speed per two same-frame clocks, man ''must'' step in at the very start and manipulate the clocks by temporally relating them. 

The best we can do here is to say that we can have a one-way law only ''after'' man has given a clock relationship.

Here is how this works in real life:

One-way case A: If man sets clocks to always obtain the baselessly prechosen value c, then the result will be c for all frames.

One-way case B: If man simply (correctly) synchronizes clocks, then the result will be c±v for all frames. 

Oddly enough, even though B has a ''correct'' result, it is not a full law of nature because nature did not synchronize the clocks. Only if nature herself sets the clocks can the result be a full law given solely by her.

Also oddly, even though nature herself did both round-trip results, neither of them is correct! That is, these (null) results were due to the use of a slowed clock and/or physically contracted rulers. 

If unshrunken rulers and an unslowed clock were used to measure light's round-trip speed, then the result would be variance and anisotropy.

Does the Wiki article say anything about any of this? No. 
But it is not possible to understand anything about the second postulate unless at least some of the above is given explicitly. And all of it is a part of today's human knowledge; I am not making any of it up.

EMS also wrote above:
"I kindly counsel against adding anything to the statement of the postulates, but to leave them as Einstein stated them."

This sounds simple indeed, but in reality, it is extremely problematic. There is no definitive second postulate from Einstein or anyone else. Einstein used various words such as "principle," "definition," "postulate," etc. when speaking of his second postulate. He gave two entirely different versions of his second postulate. Only via very careful analysis can one sift out the truth. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

Pjacobi, the first postulate did not overrule the aether.

That postulate does not say that observers cannot all get the same result c±v in the case of light's one-way speed. 

All the postulate says in that case is that ''whatever'' result is found by observers in one frame, observers in all other frames must obtain the ''same'' result. The postulate could not care less if the result happens to be c±v or simply c.

Also, the second postulate has no affect on light's source-independency. Einstein simply accepted source-independency as an experimental fact ''prior to'' the second postulate.

No definition of synchronization could possibly overrule any theory. The way to overturn theories is via experimentation, and it has been shown experimentally that light is source-independent. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 14:27, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Cadwgan is correct here, in as far as he goes.  Without asserting the constancy of the speed of light, the combination of the principle of relativity and the speed of the light being independent of the movement of the source are compatible with the aether theories.  (In fact, the purpose of the aether thoeries was to explain the astronomically determined independence of the speed of light and the motion of the source in the context of Newtonian physics.)
:::::: Look at it this way:  You have what Pauli is trying to say a bit backwards.  The second posulate alone is enough to exclude the emission theories.  Combining the second posulate with the first postulate, so that the constancy of ''c'' must apply in all interial frames of reference, is what then excludes the aether theories.  However, the first posulate alone excludes nothing. 
:::::: As for restricting the first postulate to inerital frames of reference:  That is what Einstein did on further reflection.  It turns out that in accelerated frames of reference the speed of light as viewed by the observer is a function of the gravitational potential the light is traveling at.  So in [[general relativity]], Einstein established the "general principle of relativity" in that the laws of physics must be the same in all frames of reference, and replaced the second postulate with [[local Lorentz invariance]] which states that locally spacetime must act in accord with the rules of special relativity.

Further, I propose that there should be little or no additional information in the postulates section.  Edits to the postulates section should be discouraged here in this article but encouraged in the article [[Postulates of special relativity]].  In other words, the less said about the postulates here, the better IMHO.  Let this article emphasize the implications of the STR rather than the postulates themselves.  Thoughts?  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 23:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

: We're still going in circles, for it was stable like that for a long time: the postulates of 1905 with the definition of "speed of light" as used in those definitions. We had in January:

: ''1. First [[postulate]] ([[principle of relativity]])
::  ''The laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference in which the laws of mechanics hold good (non-accelerating frames).
  
:  ''In other words: Every physical theory should look the same mathematically to every inertial observer; the laws of physics are independent of the state of inertial motion.

:  ''2. Second postulate (invariance of ''c'')
::  ''Light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c that is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body; here the velocity of light c is defined as the two-way velocity, determined with a single clock.

:  ''In other words: The [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]], commonly denoted ''c'', is the same to all inertial observers, and does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting the light. An observer attempting to measure the speed of light's propagation will get the same answer no matter how the system's components are moving.

: If we want to say the least as possible about the postulates needed for deriving the LT, then Pauli's version is preferable as it doesn't require the clarification about c. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 09:01, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:: In fact after comparing the with the treatment in a number of books, IMHO the postulate based intro in its current form seem out of place, it is more a history of science and philosophy of science topic (to be handled in [[History of special relativity]] and [[Postulates of special relativity]]).
:: The emission theory is already incompatible with pre-SR electrodynamics, Maxwell's equations make the velocity of EM radiation independent of the velocity of the source. Ritz had to modify ME to give a (somewhat) consistent emission theory.
:: The only thing to be added to Maxwell's equations to arrive at the Poincare group as invariance group, is the postulate that they  hold in every inertial frame, not only in the ether frame. That is the way, the topic is introduced e.g. in the books of Born and Møller or Einstein's 1921 Princeton lectures.
:: There is only a need for separate second postulate if one doesn't want to pull in the full Maxwell equations but is looking for the weakest possible statement, which will result in full SRT.
:: [[User:Pjacobi|Pjacobi]] 10:15, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

: It was the very purpose of the postulates to derive the LT from minimal asumptions. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 16:31, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:: Yes, but is this pupose to be presented in the main article [[Special relativity]], if it is no longer only oer even main form to preset SR in text books?
:: Anyway, in your formulation, the 2nd postulate ''is'' redundant, as the 1st already pulls in Maxwells'equatation. 
:: [[User:Pjacobi|Pjacobi]] 18:13, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

This is going to be harder than I thought...  OK, I made two proposals.

(1) Include the translated original form of the postulates of the STR as given in 'On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies".

Yes or No?

(2) Include a generally accepted modern version of the postulates of the STR. 

Yes or No?

: Ad 1.: That's essentially the version as existed (here above), and which has subsequently been edited beyond recognition. Apparently there was disagreement about them. 
: Thus it seems wise to merge the discussion of Einstein's formulation with the Postulate article; moreover, I now plan to include a separate section in this article on "Speed of Light".
: Ad 2.: Effectively, that was here above proposed by Pjacobi: Pauli's version may probably be regarded as one of the first "modern" versions of the postulates.

: PS: Eventhough Einstein's paper was a milestone because of the derivation of the LT, his presentation shouldn't be regarded as more "authentic" or "true" than others.

Yes, they have been edited beyond recognition.  Thus, my proposal to put in the translated original version of the postulates.  Any edit to the translated original words of Einstein will be reverted.  There is no reason to edit those words - they are his words and there is no room for interpretation of whether those are his words or not, right?

If we then follow with Pauli's more modern and transparent version of the postulates, we once again have a source and there would be no reason to edit those words.  Any change to Pauli's words would be reverted for good reason.  Do you see what I'm getting at?  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 13:19, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

=== Which of Einstein's versions of the first posulate do you want to use? ===

Let me throw into this discussion the 1916 version of the first postulate.  In 1916, in the [[Annalen der Physik]] article describing general relativity, Einstein wrote:
:''"The special theory of relativity is based on the following posulate, which is also satisfied by the mechanics of Galileo and Newton.
:''"If a system of coordinate K is chosen so that, in relation to it, the physical laws hold good in their simplest form, then the same laws will also hold good in relation to any other system of coordinates K' moving in uniform translation relative to K.  This postulate we call the 'special princuiple of relativity'.  The word 'special' is meant to intimate that the principle is restricted to the case when K' has a motion of uniform translation with respect to K' ...
:''"Thus the special theory of relativitty does not depart from classical mechanics through the postulate of relativity, but through the constancy of the speed of light ''in vacuo'', from which in combination with the special principle of relativity, there follow ... the Lorentz transformations, and the related laws ... ."''
The problem is that the understanding of what Einstein did in devising the special relativity has evolved since, and did even for Einstein.  Come 1916, he now knows that this is the ''special'' principle of relativity.  So we need to note that in the aritcle and in the aritcle of the [[principle of relativity]].  I also advise choosing a definite modern paraphrasing of these laws and enforce that.  I find it hard to consider Einstein's 1905 version to the best, especially when when Einstein ended up tweaking it to make room for general relativity.

In a related vein, I wish to make it clear that I '''strongly oppose''' any mention of round-trip time for the speed of light.  Harald88 is being confused by a definition that Einstein given early in the 1905 paper related to the synchonization of clocks.  The raw definition given by Einstein, which directly states that the '''one-way''' speed of light is constant, is what is important.  (I also consel people not to use the work "velocity" in the posulates.  That is used due to a translator's choice, and is not the correct term given the context in which the german word was used.  In english, "velocity" is a vector, and "speed" is a scalar which is the absolute velocity of a vector.  It is the ''speed'' of light that is constant, not the velocity.) --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:39, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:We do have [[History of special relativity]] and  [[Postulates of special relativity]]. This article should use contemporary language and flow of presentation. There is little reference to history necessary ''here''. --[[User:Pjacobi|Pjacobi]] 06:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:: That is basically what I am after here.  I have done some work on the first postulate statement in the article, and removed the excess commentary.  The second posulate I am leaving alone for now, although the phrase "independent of the motion of the emitting body" impresses me as being redundant even though it is Einstein's words.  To me, the statement that the "speed is light (in enpty space) is a constant" suffices. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:52, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

::: I similarly '''strongly oppose''' any suggestion that with "speed of light postulate" the one-way speed is meant, as that would be [[pseudo-science | pseudo scientific]]. EMS confuses his lack of understanding (or even knowledge) of the abovementioned references with my alleged lack of understanding. According to Einstein, OWLS is a ''stipulation'', and Poincare as well as modern papers call it a ''convention''. As opinions are devided on this issue, obviously some of us have a lack of understanding about the relativity/absoluteness of one-way light speed; which underscores the need for a section on this topic (but preferably the issue is avoided in the postulates section!). What papers do the "OWLS=absolute" proponents refer to?
::: Note also that "the speed of light is constant" is meaningless without the precision relative to what. Thus the formulation by Pauli is definitely the best. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 19:40, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: Might I propose that the issue of one-way versus two-way be not mentioned in this article, be mentioned in a subsection of this article with both sides being represented, or possibly have the issue discussed in another article, considering how it seems to be in contention.  The second postulate could then be stated in the postulates section in a way that doesn't necessarily specify which one it is.  Certainly neither of the wordings being batted about by Harald88 and EMS favor one or the other in such a way that jumps right out at you.
:::: As to calling explanations of the second postulate in terms of the one-way speed of light pseudo-science, that's a bit much.  There have apparently been (and given my limited access to articles, I could be wrong) numerous attempts to verify the isotropy of the one-way speed (http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v60/i2/p81_1, http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v42/i2/p731_1, and http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v56/i6/p4405_1 that I have found), with isotropy in this case implying constancy (if the one-way speed were isotropic but not constant, then the two-way speed would also not be constant as a two-way trip is composed of two one-way legs).  So it seems to be verifiable, and apparently verified.  Given this, the constancy of the one-way speed of light does not appear to be pseudo-science.
:::: As to what the second postulate says, and whether it addresses the one-way speed or two-way speed is obviously a matter of much debate (if you don't believe me, look at the rest of this page :) ), and to be honest when Einstein proposed the postulate, he didn't specify, though what he went on to say could be taken to imply one thing or another.  Given this, I reiterate my proposal that the second postulate be worded in a way that simply does not explicitly address the issue, and ideally does not implicitly favor either side.
:::: To put my money where my mouth is, so to speak, and to start the discussion along these lines, might I propose:  "The speed of light in vacuum is taken to be a universal constant, c, independent of the motion of the source of the light."
:::: There is my two cents, on top of the five dollars I've already put in.  ;) [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 22:33, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

::::: DAG, thanks for your contribution, and I think that it's not too bad in view of an upcoming clarifying section on the issue. 
::::: Apart of that, probably you overlooked in the overflow of text my clarifications to you above (22:42, 11 May 2006) for a good article by Ives as well as the straightforward statement from Foundations of physics (21:15, 9 May 2006) :
::::: ''we simply think that the lack of observability allows a multiplicity of conventional assumptions, encapsulated in some synchronization gauge, which are consistent with any possible experimental evidence. ''
::::: IMO the label [[pseudo science]] is a very strong but correct description for a prediction that "lacks observability" so that it is "consistent with any possible experimental evidence" (and apart of citing such statements I can also explain why they are correct; but such elaboration results in a separate article of course). [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 23:07, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

Harald, if the second postulate doesn't pertain to the one-way speed, then to what does it pertain? (It could ''not'' pertain to Maxwell's c because this case was closed to postulation prior to special relativity. Likewise, it ''couldn't'' pertain to the round-trip case because this case was also closed before SR. One does not need to postulate regarding past experimental results. Einstein had to be postulating regarding some future result, and the only one left was the OWLS result.)

The following points could help: 

Since Einstein invoked the PR in connection with the one-way, two-clock light speed (in his book he said that light's one-way speed would be c - v given classical clocks, and he went on to say that this result '''conflicted''' with the principle of relativity), Einstein - at that point -  had to have considered his one-way result to be a '''law''' of physics because the PR pertains ''only'' to laws. But confusion arises when we are given (as you noted) Einstein's  claim that his one-way invariance is a mere ''stipulation.'' How can a mere stipulation be a law of nature?

This brings us to the conventionality problem, the necessary attempt to find some sort of physical content within the second postulate. This can be done only by looking behind the simple-but-confusing face-value stuff just mentioned. An important clue is Einstein's statement that we must '''discard''' absolute time, i.e., we must discard the absolutely synchronous clocks of classical physics because they don't fit in with Einstein's null-results-always scheme,  even though he replaced (good)synchronous clocks with asynchronous (''incorrect'') ones!

This tells us that half of the physical content of the 2nd postulate has to be Einstein's assumption that clocks are ''properly related'' only if they get a one-way null result.  And the other half of the physical content has to be Einstein's assumption that we cannot absolutely synchronize clocks.

Only by doing this can we eliminate the total confusion (from Einstein himself) re his 2nd postulate. Otherwise, we simply have no scientific postulate because it is certain that all we would have is a mere ''definition'' (of synchronization), a nonlaw, a nonpostulate. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:09, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

: I already explained that above: the second postulate simply states the wave nature of light and the outcome of MMX as facts of observation. Of course, the first postulate already implies the outcome of MMX; but the value ''c'' is required as constant in the LT.
: And there is no "absolute" OWLS result, as the abovementioned articles explained. OWLS is as you like, as is - in  consequence - simultaneity; that doesn't affect observations. One shouldn't confuse convenience with predictions!
: I would have to look it up, but probably you misunderstand Einstein's argument; he knew very well the connection between OWLS and simultaneity.
: It would help you if you read up related articles; then you'll realise that Einstein didn't really state anything new there. Reading the papers that Einstein had as background helps to follow his argumentation. 
: Or you can read again Pauli's formulation of the same; what issue do you have with that one? [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:49, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

:: Harald - Cadwgan is quite right in the above.  My only quibble is in his remarking that asynchronous clocks are "incorrect", but either you live with that consequence for <s>co-moving</s> clocks with are in motion with respect to each other or you can't accept SR (and we already know which choice Cadwgan is making).  The current wording of the second posulate in the article (the initial version of which was placed there by you BTW) is
::: ''The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant (c) ...''
:: The speed of light in a vacuum cannot be a universal constant if it is going at a different rate in one direction than the other.  So that blatantly is a OWLS definition, one that appropriately reflects Einstein's intent and is the operative part of the second postulate.
:: It's time to give this business a rest.  I thank you for helping us to refine the postulates section.  The work is done, and I strongly advise that you rest on your laurels for a while. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

== The second postulate has not been stated ==

It is important to remember that many people who read the article may not go on to read the separate section about the postulates. 

This means that the article's postulate section must be valid and unambiguous  even if brief.  But this is certainly not the case.

For example, look at the current (5-15-2006) version of the second postulate:

 Second postulate - Invariance of c - In empty space, Light always propagates
 with a constant speed c, independent of the state of motion of the emitting 
 body.
 
It is vital to mention ''which'' light speed. Einstein did ''not'' postulate regarding light's round-trip speed. Here are his own words from his special relativity paper: 

"In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity 
2AB/(t'A-tA)=c 
[light's round-trip speed]
to be a universal constant ..."

Einstein merely and simply accepted the Michelson-Morley round-trip null result as an experimental fact ("In agreement with experience...").

This left only the '''one-way''' speed for special relativity.
The entire purpose of special relativity was to show how light's one-way speed could also be invariant.

Einstein did this in two steps, as follow:

[1] Seeing that absolutely synchronous clocks would get c ± v for light's one-way speed, Einstein proposed that such clocks cannot be obtained. (It is important to note that he did not prove this.)

[2] Additionally, he maintained that clocks will be ''properly'' related only if they are set by definition to obtain one-way light speed invariance. 

We can now make sense of Einstein's version of his second postulate, which follows (slightly paraphrased for clarity):

 Any ray of light moves relative to any coordinate system with the one-way, two-
 clock speed c as follows:
 speed = light path/time interval
 where the two-clock time interval is given by the ''definition'' in Section 1.

Since the definition applied to all inertial coordinate systems, all must get c simply by definition, but the important thing here is Einstein's belief that his clocks are ''properly'' related. This is extremely important because ''all'' of special relativity's consequences are based on the use of at least two clocks per frame, two clocks which are related via Einstein's definition.

For example, since the lack of simultaneity depends on the use two clocks per frame, Einstein felt that this is a proper result, i.e., that we simply must live with relative time (or relativity's asynchronous clocks). 

Similarly, since Einstein's transformation equations are based on the use of two clocks per frame, he maintains that these are the proper equations for physics.

Also similarly, since Einstein's addition (or composition) of velocities theorem is based on at least two clocks per frame, he believes that this result is valid. 

However, to be fair to both sides, it must be emphasized that the absolutely synchronous clocks of classical physics would ''not'' get c for light's one-way speed, no one has proved that such clocks cannot exist, and they would entirely do away with special relativity.

: I have no big quibble with much of the detail here, although I see your version of the second postulate as being redundant and self-referential.  The more direct version is much more my preference.
: As for your last paragraph, please see [[Special_relativity#Status]].

: Einstein's philosophy (as well as those of editors) is irrelevant for scientific theories. SRT relies on the observation that despite the wave property of light (thus, source independence) the PoR  still applies to it (as was found by M-M): the return-speed of light is independent of the intertial frame of reference. SRT is based on these simple principles, as the Lorentz transformations can be derived from them. Some modern derivations use only the first postulate, but in such derivations the constant in the LT is undefined. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 06:45, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

Harald, please see my reply to you in the "Which of Einstein's versions ..." section above.

Also, please note that it was not my version of the 2nd postulate, but was Einstein's. (I merely paraphrased it).

Furthermore, please note that there has been no real test of SR because the only real test is to test the real 2nd postulate. Your cited source (#Status) mentioned things such as round-trip cases and time dilation, etc. SR's effects such as time dilation do not pertain to physical clock slowing but merely to observer-dependent "effects" due to the use of absolutely asynchronous clocks. 

REF:
[From Tom Roberts, April 30 2006]
When you look at a building from directly in front, it appears to be 
wider than when you look at it from a corner. This effect does not 
affect the building itself, of course, and is purely due to your point 
of view. And because this is purely a geometrical effect, it would not 
matter if the front corners of the building were replaced with markers, 
there being no object between them. Similarly in SR, "length 
contraction" is purely a geometrical effect, an artifact of one's point 
of view, and it does not matter if there is an object between the 
endpoints, or if there are just markers with no object between.

http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics.relativity/browse_frm/thread/69494989e198f9b0/fa366ff94909a8ad#fa366ff94909a8ad

Tom continued with this:
Because the rod is moving, naturally the observer in A must mark both 
ends _simultaneously_ in frame A (which requires assistants) and then 
use a meterstick at rest in frame A to measure the length between the 
marks. Ultimately it is the difference in simultaneity between frames A 
and B that is the source of the length contraction (an observer at rest 
in frame B would say that the observer in A marked the front of the rod 
before the back end, so naturally the distance between marks in A is 
shorter than the rod at rest in B).

If one used absolutely synchronous clocks, then there would be no relativistic "length contraction, "time dilation," or "mass increase," and light's one-way speed would be c±v, not c.

Since, contrary to your #Status, relativity has had zero success regarding real physical phenomena, the burden of proof is actually on folks such as you, as is always the case with any theory. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:34, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the kind words, EMS. As for my agenda, actually, I am simply pushing for "truth in advertising," not some pet point of view. I see no need to control myself given this agenda, but I have been, and will continue to be, very respectful, unlike a certain Dirk person, who was supposed to help in the "case against me," but that backfired (as it well should have because I am not pushing anything here but the truth).

The article's second postulate section still mentions measuring light's speed, but Einstein never mentioned doing this. What he did mention was presetting clocks to obtain a prechosen value "c." (This is given explicitly in John Wheeler's book ''Spacetime Physics'', in case you need a ref.) (Of course, it was also stated by Einstein, but not as clearly as by Wheeler.) (Think about it: If the travel ''"time"'' is given up front, then there is no actual speed measurement being made.)

Do you honestly think the article is OK in this case? (And this is not the ''only'' major problem, as I have tried to point out.) [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

As you should know, Einstein’s definition was given ‘’prior to’’ his second postulate.

As you should know, the second postulate cannot exist without the definition.

As you should know, and I have said, the '''"time"''' portion of light's one-way "speed" was given by definition (again, ''prior to'' the 2nd postulate.)

And Einstein's quotes around "time" indicate that it is not an actual time measured by actual clocks, but is merely a stipulated time.

But none of this is mentioned in the article's 2nd postulate section even though it was directly given in Einstein's SR paper.

In fact, the article's 2nd postulate section does not even mention a definition, and yet this is critical to the very existence of the postulate.

== Second postulate content ==

Harald88 -

I am loathe to accuse other editors of vandalism but in this case I am getting very tempted to.  Perhaps this is a case of "a little knowledge is dangerous", but in any case I am not amused by your reducing the second posulate to
:''The speed of light is independent of the motion of the light source.''
The [[luminiferous aether|aether]] theories are compatible with this posulate.  In fact, it was to explain this observation in terms of [[classical mechanics]] that the aether theories were created.
Rindler states the second posulate as 
: ''The rectilinear speed of light is the same in all directions, in all inertial frames of reference, and at all times''.
Note that the source invariance is not noted explicitly here.  Instead it is implied in the overall constancy of the speed of light.  It is that constancy that forms the operative part of the second posulate, not the source invariance.  Please respect that. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

:EMS, please consider the following quotes from a recent article in the American Journal of Physics:
::"In the years immediately preceding 1905 and in Einstein's seminal paper, the phrase 'the constancy of the speed of light', meant ''only'' that the speed of light is independent of the source's velocity"

:and

::"Banesh Hoffmann, who worked with Einstein in the 1930s, put the matter neatly in his book, Relativity and Its Roots:
:::The second of the two principles in Einstein’s paper said that the motion of light is not affected by the motion of the source of light. Nothing, it
:::would seem, could be more orthodox and obvious.  For if a source of light generates light waves in the ether, once the waves are launched they are no
:::longer linked to their source; they are on their own, moving at the rate set by the elastic properties of the ether….
:::If it was so obvious, though, why did he need to state it as a principle? Because, having taken from the idea of light waves in the ether the one aspect that he needed, he declared early in his paper, to quote his own words, that “the introduction of a ‘luminiferous ether’ will prove to be superfluous.”
:::We see in all this the working of an extraordinary intuition. The beautiful thing about Einstein’s cunningly chosen pair of principles is that each by itself seems harmless, yet the two together form an explosive mixture destined to rock the very foundations of science."

::: Those quotes actually state what I am trying to say:  Source independce alone admits the aether theories.  After all, that was the accepted state of theorizing on the behavior of light before 1905.  What Einstein did was to say that
:::: ''light is always propagated in empty space '''with a definite [speed] ''c''''' which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body''
::: (bolded emphasis mine).  Without the bolded words, which declare the global invariance of ''c'' (as opposed to the invariance existing only in the aether frame), you are not constrained to the special theory of relativity.

::::: Tell me Harald88:  If Pauli's opinion is one that words I bolded are not needed, and if that opinion has been operative since 1921, then how is it that these three authoritative and much more modern sources '''all''' make reference to ''c'' being the same for all observers?  Perhaps for you the most damning of all for you is M. G. Bowler's statement, which references only the constancy of the speed of light, and leaves the first postulate implied by the word "universal".  As best I can tell, you are basing your view on Alfred Centauri's noting that Pauli says that the second postulate outrules the emission theories and the first postulate outrules the aether theories.  But have you read that book yourself?  I have found the relevant parts, and find that quoting from Pauli's book ({{cite book|last=Pauli|first=W.|title=Theory of Relativity|year=1921|id={{ISBN|0-486-64152-X}}}}) will help to clarify the issue:
:::::: ''[Einstein] showed that only the following axiom in electrodynamics need be assumed: ''The motion of light is independent of the motion of the light source. ''... There is no question of a '''universal constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo''' if only because it has the constant value ''c'' in Galilean frames of reference.  On the other hand its independence of the state of motion of the light source obtains equally in the general theory of relativity. ...'' 
::::: So it turns out that Pauli chose his second postulate with the general theory in mind, not the special theory alone.  To obtain the special theory, Pauli still has to assert the constancy of ''c'' in "Galilean frames of reference", and does so.

:Einstein's version of the 2nd postulate '''does not''' declare the global invariance of ''c''.  Don't take my word for it - read it for yourself.  Einstein's version of the 2nd postulate asserts that the the speed of light will be measured to be ''c'' in '''a''' frame of reference - the stationary frame of reference.  I've said this before in earlier comments in which you more or less agreed.  It is only in '''combination''' with the 1st postulate that the speed of light is declared to be ''globally invariant'' as you have put it.  From my perspective, the quotes above do not support your assertion that the 2nd postulate must  rule out aether theories.  It is my understanding and, I believe the intent of the quotes above, that the 2nd postulate rules out ''emission'' theories and the 1st postulate rules out the notion of an absolute aether frame of reference.

However, without the words "with a definite speed c" [or "The speed of light in vacuum is taken to be a universal constant (c)" as it now reads in the article], you do not have the key ingredient for relativity:  The invariance of ''c''.

FWIW, I can tell you from personal experience that in any fruitful investigation that turns up an important but unexpected result, there is a moment of absolute inspiration such that your view of and understanding of the subject is very different afterwards than it was before.  (In my own work on an alternative theory to GR, I have had two such moments).  It is obvious that Einstein sometime in late 1904 or early 1905 had such a moment.  One moment there was a set of contradictions before him, the next moment he realized that the contradiction was not real, and the path to special relativity was laid out before him.  In others words, the second posulate is not the result of a conscious decision but instead of the realization that there was no other reasonable way to explain the existing observations. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:59, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

----

Harald88, you can't seriously think that Einstein's "stationary system" meant just one particular frame. Which frame might that be, the one that is at rest relative to the "aether"? ;-)

: (Note: probably Cadwgan confused me with Alfred Centauri) [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 23:33, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

You must have overlooked Einstein's quotes around his word "stationary."

But I see from your above that you do indeed seriously believe this, so here is a direct quote from Einstein - from a mere 2 pages after your cited part:

[from Einstein's 1905 SR paper:]
"We now imagine space to be measured from the stationary system K by means of the stationary measuring-rod, and also from the moving system k by means of the measuring-rod moving with it; and that we thus obtain the co-ordinates x, y, z, and 'e', 'n', and 'k' respectively. Further, let the time t of the stationary system be determined for all points thereof at which there are clocks by means of light signals in the manner indicated in § 1; similarly let the time  of the moving system be determined for all points of the moving system at which there are clocks at rest relatively to that system by applying the method, given in § 1, of light signals between the points at which the latter clocks are located."

We can also look at it this way:
If you wish to invoke the first postulate, then you must copy exactly everything from the "stationary" frame to the "moving" frames, and, as Einstein noted above, this means copying his definition of clock "synchronization," but a definition is not a law of physics, so this cannot be copied via the first postulate, which, in turn, means that the first postulate cannot apply in this case. 

But, as Einstein noted, the first postulate is not involved. All it takes is his definition of synchronization in each frame.

Einstein's version of the 2nd postulate '''does''' declare the global invariance of ''c'' (if only via a definition). [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 20:25, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

:Very good again, Cadwgan.  Just one quibble:  As the definition of synchronization is built on the second postulate (which is a law of physics under relativity), it '''is''' carried forward to the "moving" frame by the first postulate.  Other than letting your bias sneak in at that one place, the above is an excellent and informative posting.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 20:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

::(1) Yes, it appears, Cadwgan addressed his comments to Harald88 in error.
::(2) Of course, when I use the the term stationary system in this context, I use it as Einstein did - as a label for '''a''' coordinate system in which the equations of Newtonian Mechanics hold good.

::(3) I disagree with both Cadwgan (surprise!) and EMS.  Consider that the specification of Einstein synchronization in both the stationary frame and the moving frame only ensures OWLS isotropy in the moving coordinate system.  One still needs to invoke the 1st postulate to assume the speed of light is ''c'' in the moving system.  Don't forget that I am basing my claim on Einstein's original version of the 2nd postulate.  Work it out for yourself using the same steps Einstein did in his 1905 paper until you get to the part where he says:

:::"With the help of this result we easily determine the quantities &xi;, &eta;, &zeta; by expressing in equations that light (as required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, in combination with the principle of relativity) is also propagated with velocity c when measured in the moving system."

::At this point, replace &xi; = ''c''&tau; with &xi; = ''f(v)c''&tau; and then proceed with the derivation.  Guess what?  One gets OWLS isotropy in both frames but different propagation speeds for light.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 23:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Alfred - You are saying much the same thing as myself, and it also is what Cadwgan is seeing but does not want to accept as being real.
::: BTW - Einstein did consider the case of &xi; = ''f(v)c''&tau; in [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES] [although he used ''&Phi;(v)'' instead of ''f(v)''].  Towards the end of § 3, he concluded that f(v) = 1 is required to have a self-consistent theory. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

::EMS, the f(v) I have stipulated above is not the same as Einstein's ''a'' or slightly later, his &phi;(v).  Please reconsider what I have said above.  Einstein sets the speed of the ray of light (that has speed ''c'' in the 'stationary system') to ''c'' in the moving system.  In my comments above, I say to instead set the speed of the ray of light to 'f(v)c' in the moving system.  You'll find that this does not contradict Einstein's version of the 2nd postulate but instead, violates his version of the 1st postulate.  Further, you will find that the transformation resulting from this indeed preserves the isotropy of speed of light in the moving frame but the speed is 'f(v)c' in this moving frame, not ''c''.  This result refutes Cadwgan's assertion that "Einstein's version of the 2nd postulate '''does''' declare the global invariance of ''c'' (if only via a definition)."  Once again, don't take my word for it.  Work it out just like Einstein did except to ignore the 1st postulate at the point where he invokes it as I outline above.  
::BTW, why would I want to ditch the word 'Newtonian' when that is precisely the word Einstein used?  Allow me to quote Einstein:  "Let us take a system of co-ordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good. ...we call it the 'stationary system.'".  Yes, I'm aware of the fact that Einstein goes on to show that in fact, Newtonian mechanics do not hold good because they must be replaced with relativistic mechanics.  Is this the point you are making?  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 17:37, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

Alfred (''not'' Harold88 ;-), except as an aside), the first postulate pertains only to laws. However, the "time" of light's flight in the second postulate is given purely by definition. It is not a measured time. It is not experimental.  It is not a law. Therefore, the first postulate cannot pertain to the second postulate. 

The problem is, there are two entirely different versions of the first postulate, as well as two entirely different versions of the second postulate.

Above, Alfred gave this quote:
(as required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, in combination with the principle of relativity)

Here we have both "bogus" versions. "The constancy" here refers only to light's speed through space (as in Maxwell's equations). It is not a clock-measured (or coordinate) speed.  And the "principle of relativity" here is Einstein's prime rule, '''Null results always, even in optics.'''

As I have mentioned, he used this "bogus" version of the PR to create his definition of clock "synchronization" (which - by design - follows the ''Null results always'' rule to a "T" by making sure that all frames get one-way null "results").

Given this definition of "time," we then have the real version of the second postulate, the one which says All clocks in all frames will find - by definition - light's one-way "time" to be x/c, where x is the distance from the origin/emission clock (which started on zero).

But this - as history shows clearly* - does not pertain to a law, so the the real first postulate does not pertain to the real second postulate.
(*no one has ever performed the one-way, two-clock experiment.)  [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 19:46, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

::EMS, correct if I am wrong, but Cadwgan's argument, as I now understand it, is that the principle of relativity applies to 'laws' but not definitions.  The principle of the constancy of the speed of light is not a law but is a definition instead.  Thus, the principle of relativity does not apply to the principle of the constancy of the speed of light.

::The problem I see with this argument is that, IMHO, it is not the 'laws are the same' portion of the PR that transfers the synchronization method from one coordinate system to another thus rendering Cadwgan's point moot.  Instead, it appears to me that it is the 'uniform translatory motion' portion of the PR that accomplishes this.  Indeed, without ''defining'' the relationship between the clocks that label the time coordinate within a frame of reference, the notion of relative motion between coordinate systems is itself ill-defined.

::To elaborate, whenever we actually get down to the business of using math instead of words to state the PR, we ultimately have to say something like 'the origin of the primed system moves with constant velocity ''v'' in the unprimed system' in equation form.  Clearly, this velocity is a one-way velocity and so the value of this velocity is meaningless without also specifying how the clocks are related in the unprimed system.  However, by the PR, the origin of the unprimed system moves with constant velocity ''-v'' in the primed system but this requires that the relationship between the clocks in the primed system is the same as in the unprimed system.

::To summarize, it is my opinion that the principle of relativity has no operational meaning without specifying a clock synchronization method to be used in all inertial frames.  Einstein defined a method for synchronizing clocks in a frame and so, by the PR, this method must be used in all other frames 'in uniform translatory motion'.  In other words, the transfer of a defined synchronization method in an inertial frame occurs by invoking the PR alone - no 2nd postulate needed.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 04:44, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

Alfred, the PR has nothing whatsoever to do with clock synchronization. The PR pertains only and directly to physical laws, laws given only and directly by experiment. For example, the PR was fully and properly invoked in the case of the Michelson-Morley experiment (note the key word "experiment") to transfer the experimental result of nullness in one frame to (experimental) nullness in all other frames '''prior''' to Einstein's definition of synchronization; so, contrary to Alfred's above conclusion, the PR certainly has full operational meaning sans a clock synchronization method, because no such method existed in 1887.

So EMS is simply incorrect in saying that "we can transfer whatever … using the PR." The PR transfers laws and only laws, and this means experimental results, and nothing else.

Here is Einstein's 1905 statement of the PR:

"The laws [note the key word "laws"] by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two [or more] systems of coordinates in relative translatory motion."

The "relative translatory motion" part merely refers to inertial frames, which can be detected quite well without using a definition of synchronization. (All that is needed are accelerometers.) [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 20:52, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

::: The gist of your statement is correct.  As a practical matter, we can transfer whatever we want between all frames of reference using the PoR.  To have SR, we must also use the PoR to have the speed of light be uniform and isotropic in all frames of reference.  However, you are correct in that the simultaneity definition transfers without the second postulate (and in fact as Einstein stated that definition it implies the second postulate anyway). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:25, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: Actualy, that's erroneous: Doppler detection with one clock suffices to determine speed - as you may have found out when you received a speeding ticket. Interestingly, the first direct experimental verification of time dilation was done with Doppler (Ives and stillwel). Those conventions are not essential for the theory; instead it's the theory that states that they are a matter of convention. It is similar with the system origin that you mentioned and which is also free to choose. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 17:17, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

:::Harald88, does not doppler detection of velocity require knowledge of the propagation speed of the wave?  But, to define that, we must still specify how the clocks are related.  Another way to look at it is that if we can use doppler detection to detect the speed of the origin of the primed system in the unprimed system with just one clock, haven't we just specified how the clocks are related in the unprimed system?.  After all, whether we use doppler detection or two clocks, the velocity result we get would have to agree, wouldn't they?  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 18:01, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

::::: Alfred, I must have been tired as my comment was wrong, sorry about that! Relative speed between objects is frame dependent indeed, following the used convention. If you meant that for a comparison of the laws of nature as determined in two frames, the same measurement conventions must be used, obviously that is very correct. 
::::: What I had in mind to point out (but for some reason didn't): The predicted effects don't depend on the conventional assumption that our frame is resting in space (making OWLS isotropical), just as those effects don't depend on our choice of origin. We are free to choose the inertial reference frame that we define to be in rest; and contrary to what Cadwgan seems to suggest, that doesn't invalidate SRT nor does it affect its predictions.

:::Cadwgan said:  "Alfred, the PR has nothing whatsoever to do with clock synchronization".  I disagree.  I'm well aware that the PoR pertains to laws but it also pertains to coordinate systems that are ''related'' by uniform translatory motion.  The claim that no such method of synchronization existed prior to Einstein's insight into the nature of time is objectively false.  The synchronization procedure implicity defined for the PoR before Einstein's procedure makes use of instantaneous signals to synchronize clocks.
:::That what I say is objectively true can be ascertained by examining the coordinate transformation equations that result from just the following assumptions:
::::(1) Space is isotropic (and therefore homogeneous)
::::(2) Time is homogeneous
::::(3) The PoR

The PR does not call for or produce an invariant light speed. Isotropic space does not call for or produce an invariant light speed. Homogeneous time does not call for or produce an invariant light speed.

As I said before, the PR allows Einstein's w = c ± v in all frames, and this is a variable light speed.

And there was no experimental or operational definition prior to Einstein. The PR would apply (if it applies at all) only to actual definitions, not flights of fancy (such as your infinite-speed signals).

Also, what would happen if, as you claim, the PR somehow pertains to even the fanciful "definition" with its infinite-speed signals? How would clocks be set by such signals? How would such clocks differ from those set per Einstein's definition?

 If one does not know the simple difference between 
 Einstein's and Galileo's clocks, then one cannot grasp 
 the difference between the Galilean transformation 
 equations and Einstein's transformation equations.
But let's return to the goal here - that of producing a proper second postulate section in the article.

As anyone should know, a physical postulate must pertain to something physical - specifically, a future experiment. To which future experiment does the 2nd postulate pertain? 

Given that the 2nd postulate pertains to light's speed, we can use the process of elimination to get rid of light's raw speed through space (per Maxwell's equations) and light's round-trip speed (Michelson-Morley experiment).

Therefore, the 2nd postulate must pertain to light's one-way speed.

What does the postulate say about this speed?

As everyone knows, it claims that it is invariant and isotropic.

But there is no experiment that could possibly show this.

Thus it appears that the 2nd postulate is not a scientific postulate because it does not predict the result of a possible scientific experiment.

The alleged "experiment" has never been performed.

In fact, no one has even shown on paper how to perform it, using the ideal clocks and ideal rulers of theoretical physics.

This fact can also be applied to the first postulate (the PR), as follows:

Name one IRF in which light's one-way speed is invariant and isotropic.

Since there has not been even one such frame, it is clear that the PR does not apply to the one-way, light speed case.

Not only has no frame found one-way invariance/isotropy, but it is physically impossible for this to happen experimentally.

Where is this simple fact mentioned in the article?

Einstein gave this fact by stating that it is impossible to have any sort of time involving more than one clock unless one uses a '''definition,''' with no one-way experiment involved.

No one has shown the Lorentz invariance of light's one-way speed per two clocks in the same frame, and no one can do this. It is simply not possible.

Does this sound like something that should be left out of an section about the second postulate (or the first postulate)?

How does one go about transferring a blank page (the lack of a one-way experiment) from one frame to another using the PR (as EMS mentioned)?

How does one postulate about nothing? [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 20:20, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

== Compare Einstein's version with WIKI's ==

Even Jimbo Wales could see the difference, and he's not a serious student of special relativity.

CURRENT VERSION OF WIKI SECOND POSTULATE:

<blockquote>Second postulate - Invariance of c - The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant (c) which is independent of the motion of the light source.</blockquote>

compared with

EINSTEIN'S VERSION OF THE SECOND POSTULATE:

<blockquote>Any ray of light moves in the "stationary" system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body. Hence

VELOCITY = LIGHT PATH/TIME INTERVAL

where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the definition in § 1.</blockquote>

EINSTEIN'S DEFINITION FROM § 1:

'''We have not defined a common "time" for [two clocks at points] A and B [in space], for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish ''by definition'' that the "time" required by light to travel from A to B equals the "time" it requires to travel from [point] B to [point] A.'''

EINSTEIN STATED THAT HE DID NOT POSTULATE RE LIGHT'S ROUND-TRIP SPEED:

'''In agreement with experience [experiment] we further assume the quantity'''
 
'''2AB/(t'<sub>A</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) = c''' 

'''to be a universal constant--the velocity of light in empty space.'''

It is impossible to measure light's one-way speed without two clocks, but Einstein used only ''one'' clock (clock A) here, along with the ''round-trip''  distance (2AB). We therefore know that he was speaking here of light's round-trip speed.

It is not necessary to use ''two'' clocks to measure light's round-trip speed, but Einstein used two clocks in his second postulate, so we know that this postulate pertains solely to light's one-way speed.

Light's round-trip speed and its one-way speed differ fundamentally in that the ''time'' of the latter currently depends entirely upon a definition.

In other words, the ''time'' in Einstein's second postulate is given by definition, which makes it imperative to mention the word "definition" in any version of the second postulate, just as Einstein did, but as WIKI does not.

It is also imperative to mention the fact that the second postulate pertains only to light's one-way, two-clock speed, and not to light's round-trip speed, but, again, WIKI does not do this, even though Einstein did (by completely separating the two as we saw clearly above).

:: That's according to Cadwgan. The only ''time interval'' that I see above is: (t'<sub>A</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) - the two-way speed. Apparently according to Einstein as well as Lorentz, Einstein postulated not about one-way speed but about speed as defined here above which he called "the velocity of light in empty space". BTW, this perfectly describes the MMX. 
:: After endless discussions (none of which you seem to recall) we settled to not burden the readers with a discussion of that debate upfront in the article, and to leave that sentence open for interpretation. 
:: Regards, [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 19:48, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Harald88 - I have always wondered why you ever accepted that wording.  Now I see that you do not even understand what it says.  The speed of light in a vacuum cannot be a universal constant unless its one-way speed is ''c''.  There is no need for interpretation in this regard.  The 2AB/(t'<sub>A</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) = c business '''is not a definition of ''c'''''.  Instead it represents Einstein pounding it into our heads that the speed of light must be ''c''.  Perhaps it would help if you looked above, and noted that Einstein wrote that 
:::: ''In accordance with definition, the two clocks symchronize if'' t<sub>B</sub> - t<sub>A</sub> = t'<sub>A</sub> -  t<sub>B</sub>.
::: Since Einstein is assuming the use of synchronous clocks in the ''2AB/(t'<sub>A</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) = c'' statement, it follows that ''AB/(t<sub>B</sub> - t<sub>A</sub>) = AB/(t'<sub>A</sub> -  t<sub>B</sub>) = c''.  Given that, I would like end this silliness about "one-way" and "two-way" light speeds here now.
::: Beyond that, let's give this [[devil]] (Cadwgan) his due.  He is right in that neither this article nor the [[postulates of special relativity]] article notes how time and distance are defined.  That is a legitimate issue, and it needs to be dealt with sooner or later. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 03:31, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: I know of no peer reviewed paper claiming that that equation "represents Einstein pounding it into our heads that the speed of light must be ''c''". Instead, the here above specified operational definition of light speed doesn't contain any assumption about simultaneity at all - and probably everyone here understands that. 
:::: Anyway, I'm glad to see that you agree on writing a section that discusses the OWLS speed and synchronization issue, and happily we've already collected a number of relevant sources. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 08:20, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

::::: Harald - Does the work "context" mean anything to you?  You and Cadwgan keep holding up ''2AB/(t'<sub>A</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) = c'' in isolation.  It is not presented at the beginning of a section, but instead near the end of a section called "Definition of simultaneity", in which the equivalence of the outward time and return time are explicitly stated.  Have you bothered reading the the 1905 article?  ''At the beginning'' of that article Einstein states that 
:::::: ''light is '''always''' propogated through empty space with a definite velocity ''c''.''
::::: Kindly note the word '''always'''.  I bolded it because it means just that: always!  Perhaps Rindler's description of the second postulate (from {{cite book|first=Wolfgang|last=Rindler|title=Introduction to Special Relativity|edition=2nd edition|year=1991|id={{ISBN|0-19-853952-5}}}}) may be helpful to you:

Dear EMS (don't you just love it when I go formal!),

Pardon me for saying so,  but you yourself omitted an extremely critical part of the very context that you alluded to, namely, Einstein's phrase "apparently irreconcilable."

There is simply no way that anything saying c-invariance-per-coordinate-measurements could in any way be even apparently irreconcilable with Einstein's PR-in-this-case (which is "Null results always" or "No absolute motion detection by any means, including optics.")

What ''could be'' (and certainly is) apparently irreconcilable with Einstein's PR-in-this-case is simply light's natural motion through space, which, as Einstein said, is always at the definite (not coordinate-measured) velocity (or propagational speed, to be precise) c, which is (as Einstein went on to say) really due to light's source independency.

This is all just another way of putting what Einstein stated a little clearer in his book.

It is simply his statement that due to light's constancy of movement through space at the raw speed c, observers using absolutely synchronous clocks must find w = c ± v when using the clocks to measure light's passing speed w.

But why did Einstein say it was only ''apparently'' irreconcilable?

Because he saw a loophole.

Actually, the loophole consisted of two separate smaller loopholes, viz., 

(i) no one could absolutely synchronize clocks, and<br>
(ii) clocks ''can be'' manually forced to get c one-way, even though such clocks will not be truly or absolutely synchronous.

As any fool can see, if we really cannot synchronize clocks (absolutely), and if we manually set clocks to get c one-way, we can obliterate that (terrible, to Einstein) irreconcilableness. That is, we can obtain our wish-for (baselessly) null result (even though it is not per experiment, but by definition) despite the simple law of the constancy of the velocity of light in empty space.

In other words, we can get our (baselessly) desired one-way "null result" despite the simple fact that light travels in space exactly as if there were an aether (although no aether is needed for light to propagate through space).

Dear Harald88,

You wrote: "The only ''time interval'' that I see above is: (t'<sub>A</sub>-t<sub>A</sub>) - the two-way speed."

Your remark is only apparently irreconcilable ;-) with the fact that Einstein's second postulate contained its own cute little time interval, as follows:

 VELOCITY = LIGHT PATH/TIME INTERVAL

But this (two-clock) "time" is measured by absolutely asynchronous clocks, so it cannot reflect reality. Reality can be reflected by using synchronous clocks, and, in that case, as Einstein himself admitted mathematically explicitly, light's one-way, two-clock speed would be c ± v. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 17:53, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

: Dear Cadwgan, first of all, SRT doesn't make any statements about "reality" other than about what will be measured. Also, duration and velocity can be measured with one clock, which is as physical as it can get - as demonstrated in Einstein's first paragraph. That he didn't stress in the next paragraph that any one-way speed measurement is indirectly a two-way speed measurement doesn't affect the theory in practice - and it has been amply discussed in the literature that no "physically true" or "absolute" OWLS measurement can be done. Of course, this article must mention that. I now stop wasting time on this; instead I'll start a sandbox draft. As soon as I have something I'll invite others to contribute to it. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 19:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Hello, Harald88, if it has indeed (as you claimed above) "been amply discussed in the literature that no 'physically true' or 'absolute' OWLS measurement can be done," then how could Einstein postulate about such a measurement? (As the 1905 paper stated, the second postulate allegedly pertains to light's one-way speed per two clocks, but if there is no such experiment, then there can be no postulate about it.) [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

: Roundtrip speed is c and one way speed after Einstein synchronisation is c. And both this statements are equivalent. 
: Note that I did not write this now - it was Pjacobi's first reply three weeks ago! In a few sentences he said all that was needed. Now please help to collect the abovementioned source materials for my sandbox that is still empty [[user talk:Harald88/sandbox]], and next we can summarize the essentials in a short section. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 19:24, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

:: Harald88 - I am not sure that I 100% agree with the above as written, but I do agree with the one-way speed of light being ''c'' for any observer using the Einstein synchronization procedure to determine the time-of-flight of a photon.  Maybe the only disagreement we have at this time is one of emphasis.  Still, I advise being careful in your writing. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:11, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

Harald88 claimed above that the "statements are equivalent"; that this is not so is easily seen by the simple facts that even though the round-trip experiment was performed in 1887, no one-way experiment has ever been performed, not even on paper using ideal rulers and clocks. These simple facts tell us that the statements differ fundamentally, in stark contrast with Harald88's claim. [[User:Cadwgan Gedrych|Cadwgan Gedrych]] 18:39, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

: As I said, that wasn't my phrasing but Pjacobi's reply to you, and I think that it was very good - but somehow it didn't "reach" you(?!) Here's a second chance: 
::: Roundtrip speed is c and one way speed ''after'' [[Einstein synchronisation]] is c. And both this statements are equivalent. This was known and published in the times of Einstein and Reichenbach and is still valid and re-iterated today. In modern coordinate-free formulation the issue of Einstein synchronisation vs. consistent alternatives doesn't even arise, it's clear that it's only about the choice of coordinates. 
::: Do you suggest that we re-word to the more correct but obscure sounding: 
::: ''One of the most highly counterintuitive of these results (and, as stated above, commonly included in statements of the second postulate), is that inertal observes can choose their coordinate systems so, that the speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is the same to all of them.'' --[[User:Pjacobi|Pjacobi]] 18:27, 7 May 2006 (UTC)
:::[...]
::: I don't think it should be phrased, that ''it is impossible to test the second postulate''. Because the second postulate, taken in the form ''Roundtrip speed is c'' or ''one way speed ''after'' [[Einstein synchronisation]] is c'' or ''For every initial observer there is a choice of foliation (co-ordinate system) which makes the non-coordinate-free formulation of Maxwell Equatations valid'' is testable and tested to great precision. Also the equivalence of Einstein synchronisation via exchange of light signals and by slow transport of clocks is testable (and tested, but I'm not sure about the precision). --[[User:Pjacobi|Pjacobi]] 19:33, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

: Also it's not true (or highly misleading) if you claim that no one-way ''experiment'' has ever been performed.

what are wrong in these 2 situations:

many far away stars are measured to be traveling faster than the speed of light from us

this concept of warp bubbles takes the spaceship inside it faster than light speed by twisting space and so on

both these situation can carry information. wat is wrong? i think it might be something to do with the fact that the objects themselves arent accelerating itself from some experimenter, but rather spacetime is pushing them like a wave. can someone correct me? <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Duel me|Duel me]] ([[User talk:Duel me|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duel me|contribs]]) 13:04 UTC, June 8, 2006.</small>

: You are asking about [[general relativity]] related phenomena.  The "warp bubble" business involves the [[Alcubierre metric]], which may not desribe a physically realizable situation.  On the other hand, I can only guess at that you mean by "far stars measured to be traveling faster then light from us".  If I take out the words "measured to be" (as such stars cannot be seen), then I get a reference to the [[Big Bang]] and its related [[expansion of the universe]].  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:33, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

Hi 24.52.254.62
 i'm new to using "talk page", so hope this gets to you.
As i understand it you are the anonymous user who has reformated the exernal links list under Special Relativity.

The external link's list that you reformatted 7 June seemed to be a way of 24.52.254.62 placing a new link in at the second top of the link's list.

The movement of the link to the Relativity calculator hosted by magen.co.uk to a lower position in the list resulted in a substantial drop in visitors from Wikipedia.

I reason that your change was to give the new link that you inserted an enhanced hit rate.

There seem's to be no reason for categorising the link's list as it fairly short and links are described well.

Categorising as you have done it, misrepresents not only my site's content but other's too.

My site
My web page is a web page. I offer no software. The calculator on the web page is Java based and i give a warning about load times in the link description.

There are no adverts or commercial interest on the site. 

The calculator is not a simulator. The geometry displayed contains the geometry of the Lorentz transform. The calculations, are from the pure geometry, the results conform to the Lorentz transform, as they should.  That it look's like the Israeli flag, is unfortunate(*1) (do you want to blame Lorentz or Einstein?), which is why i have gone to the trouble of pointing out the difference between it and the Israeli flag elsewhere on the site.

From my stats i can say that very few vistitors from Wikipedia, ever go to those pages. They are visited mainly by people interested in matters relating to their religion.

What use is it? (a)It calculates. (b)The calculator display enables a user to see and examine the geometry behind the Lorentz Transform in the whole.

Future updates planned.
For the last 18 months i have done little due to terminal cancer. That was one reason for creating it, also it was Relativities Centenery.

Well i'm still here, and slowly getting some energy back.
0)Right mouse stuff needs revision. 
1)There is a need to arrange some way of clarifying (for people who are new to relativity) the relationship between calculated values and the specific related Lorentz Transform.
2)Relative distance. Values not displayed at the moment.
3)Unit conversion. Maybe, but no one has asked for it.
4)Update help pages. Working on that, but they are rarely looked at.
5..n)etc.Fitz Gerald contraction in direction of motion.

Lot's to do, but changes have wiped out visits to my site. Getting visitors is uplifting, and acts as a spur.( gives my life meaning. Sad, i know.)

If you wish to propose a compromise please do so.

The geometry used, is the geometry i created when i was trying to understand Special Relativity some 25 years ago. I never published then because i had great misgivings about it's similarity to the Israeli flag, and i know how moral relativists vaunt Einsteins work as a validation of their philosophy. I have now, and that is why the web site has the layout it has. I welcome advice and discussion on enhancments. Thank you[[User:Magencalc|Vince]] 00:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Lead ==

I'm going to have a whack at rewriting the lead from scratch. I see the following as being problems with the current version: (1) It would be hard for a nonspecialist to understand. (2) It doesn't explain where the word "relativity" comes from, or mention the fundamental idea that all frames of reference are equally valid. (3) It doesn't explain its relation to classical mechanics (the limit of v<<c).--[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 00:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:My only comment is in regard to your first point.  While the intro doesn't really address some of the things a nonspecialist might want addressed, I thought that was the point of the [[Introduction to Special Relativity]] article, which is linked to right at the top.  Basically, isn't the audience of this article supposed to be more technically minded, or if not to have gone through and read and understood the intro article?  Just food for thought.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 01:10, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::Well, you can tell me if you think what I did is an improvement. I don't think there's any virtue in writing unclearly what could be written clearly, and I don't think there's anything in the lead that needs to be expressed in a very technical or mathematical way. I looked through some of the discussion of the relationship between the two articles, and agree with those who say that they should be merged. Every article in WP is theoretically supposed to be understandable to the general reader. Of course that's just an ideal to be striven for, but special relativity is not a subject that inherently requires a lot of math to develop properly -- a little algebra is all that's really needed.--[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 01:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: I don't like the new lead.  It is way too big.  The older lead, being shorter and move concise, was much better.  I you think that this materaial needs to be discussed first, then I would advise creating a "Background" section.  I also advise that you get an account if you are going to be bere a lot.  Finally, you may want to consider a broad rewrite of this article.  At this time, it is a hodge-pogde of various viewpoints operating at various levels of sophistication.  (One thing that I would like to do is to take the "phsyics in spacetime" section and turn it into an article entitled "Tensors in special relativity".) --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:::: I agree 100% that the article needs a broad rewrite, and that it's a hodgepodge of levels of sophistication. I think a rewrite should happen in the context of merging it with the [[Introduction to special relativity]] article. It's not normal on wp to have two different articles on the same topic. I disagree that the lead is too long, however. If you take a look at the discussion of nominations for FA, the expectation for any substantial article is generally that it should be about four paragraphs. In fact, if you look at the relativity article's own archived discussion on its nomination for FA, you'll see that one of the criticisms was that the lead was too short (although I don't know if it was even shorter then).--[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 03:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:::: <i>One thing that I would like to do is to take the "phsyics in spacetime" section and turn it into an article entitled "Tensors in special relativity".</i> I like this idea. There is absolutely no reason to be using matrix notation in this article. WP articles are supposed to be written for the general reader, so if there's a fancy mathematical technique that isn't indispensible for the development of the topic, then it should be omitted. I also think the <i>ict</i> stuff should be taken out. Very few authors use <i>ict</i>, and again, it's just an unnecessary mathematical obstacle to allowing a lay reader to follow the article.--[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 03:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== "or even information"? ==

I made some corrections in the intro, but for the moment I didn't remove the claim that according to SRT "even information" can't travel faster than light. I've read that claim before but SRT states nothing about something as abstract as "information", it's probably a fable; instead SRT states that no matter can travel as fast as radiation (light).

Interestingly, a few days ago it was on the news that Gisin in Geneva now claims to have succeeded a teleportation experiment of "instantaneous" information by means of two distant but coupled photons. True or not, and no matter how mindboggling this is, it doesn't really matter for SRT. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 09:25, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:I agree that special relativity itself, as the theory is usually bounded, doesn't say anything about information.  If the theory of special relativity was a person, and you mentioned to it that it prevented the transport of information at speeds faster than that of light, it would stare at you blankly for about five minutes before asking you what information was.  That's not to say that it doesn't seem to imply this restriction, as if you can't send a letter faster than light, and light will always travel at the speed of light ( at least in a vacuum ), the list of possible ways to send "information" ( used here in the generic, off the cuff sense and not in any strict mathematical sense ) becomes, erm, vanishingly small.  ;)  Of course, there is the possibility of the kind of quantum entanglement things Harald mentioned, as well as claims of instantaneous transport of particles via quantum tunneling ( I only vaguely remember hearing about someone trying to work with that somewhere, though the usefulness of a phenomenon that would require the only route between point A and point B be through an extremely large potential barrier seems dubious to me... ).

:So, I guess the real question would be does anyone know off hand of any proofs or such about the impact of SR on information transport?  <shrug>  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 10:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::The argument is that transmitting information faster than light would violate causality. See the section on "Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light." This is part of the standard, widely accepted interpretation of SR. For a nice discussion of this, see Taylor and Wheeler, Spacetime Physics, 2nd ed., p. 181: "Can no effect whatever produced at A affect what happens at D? If so, D ...forms a spacelike pair with event A." I'll add a footnote.--[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 15:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: Apparently that statement has now been disproved, without anyone claiming that SRT (and thus GRT) have been disproved with it. Thus Taylor and Wheeler's discussion would possibly make an interesting short section somewhere lower in the article. However, the lead is supposed to be a summary of the main points of the theory, as covered in the body of the article. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: The proof is fairly simple:  What would carry the information?  Neither light nor matter can propagate faster than ''c'', and so nothing known could do it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:::: But violating causality doesn't violate relativity. 
:::: "''Causality, Relativity'', [unrestricted] ''FTL: choose any two.''"
::::[[User:Wwoods|—wwoods]] 20:25, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::::: Indeed, and Lack of knowledge is not "proof". According to the most popular interpretation of QM, nothing "propagates" between entangled photons but the information transfer is instantaneous. SRT has nothing to say about such things. In any case, such inferrences (not by Lorentz or Einstein, right?) don't belong in the intro. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Yeah, there is some quantum weirdness that might be able to do it.  Which means that in some sense, the causality of special relativity is very tightly defined.  That is that there can be a causal connection between if it is possible for a light beam ( or anything slower like your friendly neighborhood mailman : ) ) to connect the two events.  It turns out because of what special relativity has to say about getting things to move very fast is that if it has mass, it takes infinite energy to attain the speed of light, and if it doesn't have mass, it moves at the speed of light, and so within this framework it becomes hard to see how to get a message between two events that aren't causally connected in the SR sense.  Of course, SR in and of itself does nothing to define information mathematically and then apply the rest of the theory to show that it can not violate causality a la SR.  Now, maybe someone later did go through this and show this ( or not show it for all I know ), but that's someone else's theory ( in the same sense that the Dirac equation isn't a part of SR even though it uses it to refine the quantum model of the electron ).  Anyway, that's my way of looking at it.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 21:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

Someone rewrote the explanation of why it's called "special," stating it in terms of inertial frames instead of no gravity. The two explanations are equivalent according to the [[equivalence principle]]. The general reader knows what gravity is, but doesn't know what an inertial frame is, so it makes more sense to explain it in terms of gravity. I've reverted the edit.--[[User:24.52.254.62|24.52.254.62]] 15:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

: The two explanations are not equivalent: the correct one explains the meaning of "special relativity". See also below; thus I revert to it. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
{{talkarchive}}

== Introduction ==

The article should start off by saying what special relativity actually is (cf. [[general relativity]]) before saying who formulated it. [[User:Mpatel|MP]]  [[User_talk:Mpatel | (talk)]] 15:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Nonmaterial energy? ==

The new intro has as the last sentense of its first paragraph:
: ''Einstein's theory extends Galilean relativity to embrace both material objects such as people and nonmaterial forms of energy such as light.''
This is totally incorrect and misleading.
# [[Classical mechanics]] could handle light as well as normal matter (although it did make some incorrect predictions).
# What makes SR different is the constancy of the speed of light for all observers.
I did an edit that reflected that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special_relativity&diff=59223086&oldid=59205678].  I see that edit as being more correct since the constancy of ''c'' is a central postulate of SR instead of being a consequence.

:: You must be hallucinating - at least that's my explanation, as I did not mangle that part. And I agree that your version is more correct than Anon's. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== the term"special relativity" ==

Another editor apparently is ignorant about the maeaning of "special relativity". The termm was introduced by Einstein in 1916, and there as well in his book on the "special and the general theroy of relativity" he explains why. In short, "the special principle of relativity, i.e. the principle of the physical relativity of all uniform motion". Disagreement about its meaning isn't an option. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:14, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

: Harald - I will warn you now that you already have a history of taking inappropriately narrow views on issues related to relativity.  I will not say that you are wrong about SR applying to "uniform motion", and in fact I like that wording much better than "inertial motion" or Einstein's own "uniform translatory motion".  However, there is the issue of how to fit such concerns into what this anon is doing in a way that improves that article.  Do note that your changes to my wording, while technically correct, did have the effect of making my text more technical and cumbersome.  Hence the "mangling" I referred to above.  So please try to take a more "global" view here, in which the needs of the article are balanced against the desire for technical accuracy.
: One more thing:  I chose not to revert earlier since I want to avoid an edit war, and since the anon chose to comment here after he reverted the lead.  Discussion needs to be tried first here.  While I disapprove of the anon's version of the lead, it is not so egregiously wrong that the issues surrounding it cannot be discussed first. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:37, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: EMS, I will ignore your warning, since what you state about me certainly applies to yourself - but I'm glad that this time you don't go as far as stating that Einstein didn't know what his own definition meant. 
::: So far I don't know what "mangling" you meant - except if you mean my tweeking of "motion" to "linear motion" - corresponding to the mistake that anon had made with his/her rotating planet example. Usually it's not hard to state things correctly without becoming too technical, even schoolkids know what linear motion is! [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:33, 18 June 2006 (UTC) 

::If I might suggest a phrasing that perhaps covers a little ground on both sides:

::"The theory was given the name special relativity because it only addressed the application of the principle of relativity to the special case of inertial frames of reference.  This contrasts with Einstein's theory of general relativity which applies the principle of relativity to all frames, inertial or not, and provides a description of gravity.  Special relativity does not account for the effects of gravitational fields, though it can deal with accelerations.  Another respect in which special relativity is 'special' is that general relativity reduces to special relativity in the case that there is no gravitational field."

::I think this covers both bases ( both of which are true enough, and to some extent equivalent, but I think it's good to spell both points out separately ).  Of course, I can't say I'm perfectly happy with the phrasing in some places ( particularly the part about GR describing gravity and the end of the last sentence ).  So, comments/ideas?  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 21:27, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::: I can go along with it.  I would change "gravity" to [[gravitation]] and "inertial motion" to "uniform motion" (although I may link the second phrase to the [[inertia]] article).  I also suggest making this the second paragraph.  Finally, I would like any changes to wait until the anon returns and has a chance to comment. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

:::: All fine to me; rests the question if this - now longer - paragraph is best a part of the summary lead, or if it may be better in the first paragraph of the body of the article (where it is actually lacking). [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:33, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

::::: IMO this is needed in a broad-brush treatement of SR.  So as long as the lead is not getting too big, it can stay there.  Note that a compromise position may be in order:  a brief mention in the lead and a fuller treatment in an introduction may work.  However, we need to first get this revised lead set up, and then determine what an introduction should look like.  So my advice is to go with this fuller paragraph for now and change it later if it should become appropriate to do so. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:16, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Meanwhile I replace "linear" by "[[inertial| uniform]]" motion, that's a good idea. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:30, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

== Careful wording ==

We must be very careful of the wording in this article as a simple word can break the whole concept of relativity.  I recently made a change to the sentence "''...and returns to discover that his twin has aged much more rapidly.''" by removing the word "''rapidly''".  This misleads the reader to think that time was '''really''' passing faster for the twin on earth which breaks the concept of relativity.  The stationary twin's time didn't pass faster, only more of it passed. [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 08:21, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for that improvement. "Time passing faster" is a meaningless concept: time always goes one second per second. —[[User:Keenan Pepper|Keenan Pepper]] 14:14, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

== The second postulate ==

I believe the second postulate should read:
<blockquote>
There is an upper limit to the speed of interaction between two physical objects which is constant throughout space and time. This maximum speed is in fact equal to the speed of light in a vacuum.
</blockquote>
From the first postulate, it can be then concluded that this maximum speed is the same in all inertial reference frames.

I think as it stands, the second postulate is not sufficient. I'm not sure, but I don't believe that simply saying the speed of light is a constant in all reference frames is enough to imply that the maximum speed of interaction is equal to the speed of light in all reference frames, which needs to be stated somehow either as a postulate or as a derivation. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 17:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:There have in the not too distant past been extensive discussions on how exactly the second postulate should be worded.  Many or most of it is archived, though some is on top of the page.  You might want to skim some of that for an idea of what on earth we were all thinking at the time.  If I remember correctly, the current wording was something of a compromise.  Just a heads up, or a warning to keep your head down, as the case may turn out to be...  ;) :D  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 18:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:: Einstein did not postulate a maximum.  He postulated that there is a speed ''c'' (the [[speed of light]]) which is the same is all inertial frames of reference.  That this constant speed is a maximum is a consequence of the theory. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

: Nowadays it's becoming popular to postulate a possible limit speed; if that speed is infinity we would get "Galilean relativity", but it was experimentally found that that speed is c. Any of such approaches is sufficient. The second postulate isn't like a commandment. ;-) [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 20:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

== 4-D is not able to be scientifically established. ==

To:  Wikipedia<br>

28 July 2006

From: Gerald L. O'Barr   <globarr@yahoo.com> <br>
6441 Dennison St.    (858) 453-0071<br>
San Diego, CA 92122 

The following thoughts should appear in any 
subject where Special Relativity is being presented:

----

As far as it is presently known, it is 
mathematically impossible for any test to 
differentiate between the 4-D of Special Relativity 
(SR) and a reality of simple 3-D where there are 
changes in lengths of rulers and in the rates of 
clocks, as was assumed by Lorentz.  Thus, the 
assumption that there is 4-D cannot yet be 
scientifically supported.  It is therefore 
unscientific to accept 4-D over a simpler 3-D 
approach, unless or until a test can be made that 
would properly discriminate between these two 
approaches, and in which support for 4-D was 
unambiguously shown.    

The study of SR by using 4-D math is acceptable, 
since it is a very powerful and effective way to 
solve the math that needs to be solved.  But at no 
time should any interpretation be made that this 
supports 4-D, since it does not.  Math problems can 
often be solved by using a number of dimensions 
greater than what is actually involved.  It only 
takes an appropriate number of zeros and/or other 
inter-relationships to accomplish such actions.   

The use of a simple 3-D approach removes all 
apparent paradoxes.  In other words, most of the odd 
things that appear to occur in SR are mainly the 
effects of having measurement tools that change in 
their lengths or rates, and not due to anything odd 
with the actual physics.  

Thanks for reading!

:Um, even [[classical mechanics]] has four dimensions. It's obvious there are four dimensions because you need four coordinates to specify where and when an event takes place; for example, latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. Being in the right place at the wrong time is just as bad as being in the wrong place at the right time.
:You say "The following thoughts should appear in any subject where Special Relativity is being presented", but that is not true, they're only your thoughts, and they're not notable enough to appear in an encyclopedia article. Publish a paper in a peer-reviewed journal and then maybe we'll mention it. —[[User:Keenan Pepper|Keenan Pepper]] 21:05, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

O'Barr comments:

You are exactly correct: classical mechanics has 4-D.  And if you want to add temperature, then of course we now have 5-D.  It is exactly because classical mechanics has all this, then the assumption of SR experts that we need something different, like this SR 4-D spacetime continuum, makes it all funny and silly and unscientific.  Thank you for agreeing with me.  And even though you seem to say that you will be unable to understand me unless I get published, let me assure you that I can understand you, whether you are published or not.  Sorry about your inabilities where you appear that you need the help of someone else (a peer review) in order for you to know if what I say is correct or not.  
Now I feel that all this is in violation of the rules, here.  Why did you fail to show the experiment that is used to justify there being a 4-D, and not a 3-D?  That was the subject, was it not?  There is a place where it is stated that you do not accept 4-D, you accept (3 + 1)-D.   This is correct!  This is just a sneaky way of saying that you accept Lorentz's approach, without having to say so.  
Gerald.

:Pardon? I didn't say I couldn't understand you, I said your thoughts don't belong in the encyclopedia article, because they're [[WP:NOR|original research]] and not [[WP:V|verifiable]]. Many experiments have confirmed the predictions of SR with great accuracy: [[Hafele-Keating experiment]], [[Ives-Stilwell experiment]], [[Kennedy-Thorndike experiment]]... —[[User:Keenan Pepper|Keenan Pepper]] 22:21, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

O'Barr comments:

You do not show any signs of understanding me.  I 
was not presenting any of ‘my research.’  I was not 
insisting upon any of ‘my thoughts’ to be presented.  
And I do not question the accuracy of the results of 
anyone.  SR math is very perfect, in the domain where 
it applies.  SR 4-D math is most perfect.  The 
question is not a math question.  The question is, to 
what extent do we know that our physical reality is a 
4-D spacetime continuum, and not a simple 3-D 
reality?  

Let me explain to you some very important things 
about science, and about theories.  The correct 
presentation of any scientific theory requires, as a 
minimum, the following:
*Its basic concepts and/or what it does or accomplishes. 
*The basic assumptions and/or principles upon which it is based.  
*The extent to which it has been established as being correct or found to be useful.  
*And last of all, what is its greatest weaknesses and/or criticism.    
   
And if you find any theory where such weaknesses 
and criticisms are not given, you have a problem on 
your hands.  And I see very little of such 
discussions in this article.  You all like to talk 
about the accuracies of the measurements, but you 
rarely mention the fundamental limitations that 
exist.  I was trying to tell you that such a thought, 
even if it was only one or two paragraphs, should be 
made, if you are going to be scientific about your 
article.  You are, after all, writing an 
Encyclopedia, not a research article.  And an 
Encyclopedia has an obligation to scope out both the 
good and the bad (or the strengths and the 
weaknesses) of any subject. 
 
I noticed in reading some of the archive on this 
subject that there have been many criticisms made of 
SR.  But I still do not see any addressed in the 
actual article.  Why is that?  Why is it considered 
to be un-allowed to present valid criticism of this 
theory?  The criticism I presented is not my 
criticism.  It is a very common fact that present 
testing cannot make this simple separation between SR 
and LET.  This is a weakness to SR.  To be 
scientific, you should address this issue.  And it 
has nothing at all to do with me, or whether I am 
published or not.

There are many other weaknesses to this theory, 
and you need to at least mention some of these 
weaknesses.  At least, that is my opinion!  

Gerald.

:Okay, now we're getting somewhere. You're right, every theory has weaknesses that should be presented, but this article '''does''' present them. There is a section [[Special relativity#Status]] that links to '''an entire article''' [[Status of special relativity]] devoted to the subject. Does that satisfy you? You are welcome to add any criticisms or shortcomings that are missing, as long as your additions follow the Wikipedia policies of [[WP:N|notability]], [[WP:V|verifiability]], etc. —[[User:Keenan Pepper|Keenan Pepper]] 00:04, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

::May I ask Gerald - can you give a hypothetical example of what a test might be that would answer the question of whether we are dealing with a 3-dimensional space or a 4-dimensional space? [[User:PAR|PAR]] 00:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

FYI - O'Barr is a well known anti-relativitst from the [[USENET]] sci.phyics.relativity [[newsgroup]].  I counsel against taking him too seriously.

O'Barr comments on the above: I fully and completely support SR math  
and its predictions.  I am therefore, to this degree, not anti-SR.

O'Barr comments to the comments above the FYI note:

I read your ‘status’ section.  And it is an 
important section.  It is important to point out the 
domain that SR covers.  These domain limitations are 
in some sense a weakness in this theory, but not 
really.  No theory is expected to cover everything.  
And it is important to point out the accuracies that 
the theory is able to achieve.  This is certainly a 
potential weakness for many theories.  But with SR, 
this weakness ends up being our own weakness in the 
efforts we can make in our testing, not any weakness 
in SR.  

You pointed out specific tests that supports SR.  
You even pointed out some specific tests that 
differentiates SR from other theories.  All this is 
good.  But let me tell you what this section did not 
do:  It did not point out one test that 
differentiated SR from LET.  And this of course was 
initially and apparently still is the subject of my 
posting.  And at no time did you present any 
fundamental problems with SR.  So this section does 
not address the needs that I see.  Maybe some of your 
references do some of these things, but I doubt it.

Now you did ask one question.  You asked, ‘can you 
give a hypothetical example of what a test might be 
that would answer the question of whether we are 
dealing with a 3-dimensional space or a 4-dimensional 
space?’

Thank you for asking!  Do you think that question 
is an important question?  That is why I asked this 
question.  Unless and until we (at least one of us) 
are able to answer this question, then we certainly 
might have the right to propose a 4th dimension, but 
it would have no advantage over a simpler 3-D if the 
3-D can do everything that your 4-D is able to do.

Now I have written articles about how we determine 
if we have a 1 or a 2 or a 3 or a 4 dimension 
reality, and it is very simple.  And the steps in 
going from 1 to 2, and from 2 to 3, they are exactly 
the same, as all additional dimensions would have to 
be.  But there is no evidence at all when we try to 
go from 3 to 4.  There is no evidence at all as we 
look for a 4-D world.  None!  Zero!
   
So thank you for asking!

Gerald.

O'Barr comments to O'Barr!

Hey!  I just found your reference, the 'status of
Special Relativity!  I thought that 'status' was the 
section to which you were referring.  And in this
section you do mention that LET is equivalent to SR.
No one can ask for more than this.  You are saying
that a LET 3-D reality will produce the identical 
results as a SR 4-D, and this is correct.

I am now sorry that I took so much of your time.
Please forgive me!

You really ought to say this at the very start
of your article on SR, and not hide it so deep!
Gerald.

== Steer clear of ''ict'' ==

I have removed the ''ict'' notation except for a small note explaining why it shouldn't be used. A good discussion of the reasons is given in "Gravitation" by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler in Box 2.1 entitled "Farewell to ''ict'' ". Some of the reasons given are:

* To single out the time coordinate as the only imaginary coordinate, while the others are real is deeply misleading. Spacetime is isotropic, there are no preferred directions, and the implication that time is somehow special is counterproductive. The difference between spacelike and timelike directions is fully and completely contained in the invariant Minkowski metric, where it belongs, and not in the particular choice of coordinate system, where it does not belong.
* To reinforce this - there is no place for this notation in general relativity. Disguising the Minkowski metric to look like a Euclidean metric in general relativity leads to a confusing and unwieldy theory.

There are other reasons given, but I find these to be the most compelling. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 00:24, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

: Gerald L. O'Barr <globarr@yahoo.com> comments:

:What a silly thing to take offense with.  The use of ict is mathematically correct, and it produces correct math answers.  You seem to have a desire to make, in your mind’s eye, space to be the same as time and time the same as space.  You want spacetime to be isotropic.  You want a lot of things here.  But why?  You have no reason to have any of these things, since the math of SR will be just as exact and perfect with or without ict, and therefore there is no mathematical reason to do any of this. 
 
:Let me say what needs to be said just as clearly as possible:  You did not say that the physics required you to do this.  You did not say that the math or the science required you to do any of this.  All you could say was that you thought it was compelling.  Well, maybe it is compelling to your feelings, but again and again, there really is not one single test or one single test result or one single test analysis of a test result that would be able to support or to discriminate against your actions.  It is a non-scientific act.  SR is not a physical theory, and cannot speak to such issues.  

:As a math theory, which SR is, you can formulate the math in a multitude of ways.  There is no way that you can say one of these ways is any better than another way, as far as the theory exists.  And if you want to state this, then you can change the math in any way you please.  But please do not indicate that one form of the math is more ‘compelling’ than another.  It is nothing like this at all unless you can show a test that scientifically confirms your position.  
  
:At least that is MMHO!  Thanks for reading.

:Hi Gerald - ('''Please don't indent your paragraphs!''' - it looks terrible - I see it has been fixed.) The theory of planetary motion was originally formulated as the planets and the sun rotating in perfect circles around the earth. This was found to be in error, because certain planets seemed to stop and go backwards for a while. This was fixed by adding "epicycles" in which the planets travelled in perfect circles about a point on the orbit, which was a perfect circle. This process could be continued indefinitely, and an accurate theory with the earth at the center of the solar system could be constructed with a sufficient number of epicycles with angels pushing the planets around their epicycles. Another theory is that the sun is at the center of the solar system and the orbits of the planets are elliptical. This also reproduces the observed motion, and falls neatly into place with the Newtonian theory of gravitation.  There is no test that can distinguish between the two theories. But I find the second model of the solar system to be more compelling, as do most scientists. [[User:PAR|PAR]] 17:14, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

::I have to agree with Gerald here.  As far as I know, putting an imaginary number in the temporal term doesn't materially affect the actual theory, but is instead a convention.  It's the same as choosing the spatial terms to be negative and the temporal term to be positive.  Or putting the temporal term before the spatial terms and vice versa.  As long as you choose one and stick with it, I'm not sure it matters (though mixing conventions can prove to be quite painful).  That being said, everyone has their own opinion as to each of these conventions should be used.  I generally don't use ict, put time after the spatial components, and have time be negative.  So...

::As to planets and such, that's a bit different as there are two different theories being discussed, versus just one.  And besides, there is a test that can ditinguish between them, that is give any group of students two tests, one on each theory after a normal course in introductory physics, and see which test has higher scores...  ;) :D  Cheers.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 18:18, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

:::Maybe I wasn't clear enough - The problem does not exist so much in special relativity as it does in general relativity. Once you study and learn general relativity, the use of ''ict'' will feel like epicycles on planetary orbits. Sure, you can make it work, but you know in your heart its not right. When you see the central importance of the metric tensor and the simplifications that it brings, and then go back to the special case of special relativity, you will see that the insights gained in general relativity can be carried over to a deeper understanding of special relativity itself. Here is the section from "Gravitation" by Misner, Wheeler, and Thorne on the subject. (Emphasis is mine.) [[User:PAR|PAR]] 22:24, 8 August 2006 (UTC) 

<blockquote><blockquote>
<div style="width: 512px; float: center; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; padding: 1em; font-size: 90%">'''Box 2.1 FAREWELL TO "ict" '''

"One sometime participant in special relativity will have to be put to the sword: ''<math>x^4=ict</math>''. This imaginary coordinate was invented to make the geometry of spacetime look formally as little different as possible from the geometry of Euclidean space; to make a Lorentz transformation look on paper like a rotation; and to spare one the distinction that one otherwise is forced to make between quantities with upper indices (such as the components <math>p^\mu</math> of the energy-momentum vector) and quantities with lower indices (such as the components <math>p_\mu</math> of the energy momentum 1-form). However, it is no kindness to be spared this latter distinction. Without it, one cannot know whether a vector (&sect;2.3) is meant or the very different geometric object that is a 1-form (&sect;2.5). Moreover, there is a significant difference between an angle on which everything depends perodically (a rotation) and a parameter the increase of which gives rise to ever-growing momentum differences (the "velocity parameter" of a Lorentz transformation; Box 2.4). If the imaginary time-coordinate hides from view the character of the geometric object being dealt with and the nature of the parameter in a transformation, it also does something evern more serious; it hides the completely different metric structure (&sect 2.4) of +++ geometry and -++++ geometry. In Euclidean geometry, when the distance betwen two points is zero, the two points must be the same point. In Lorentz-Minkowski geometry, when the interval between two events is zero, one event may be on Earth and the other on a supernova in the galaxy M31, but their separation must be a null ray (piece of a light cone). The backward-pointing light cone at a given event contains all the events by which that event can be influenced. The forward-pointing light cone contains all events that it can influence. The multitude of double light cones taking off from all the events of spacetime forms an interlocking causal structure. This structure makes the machinery of the physical world function as it does (further comments on this structure in Wheeler and Feynman 1945 and 1949 and in Zeeman 1964). If in a region where spacetime is flat, one can hide this structure from view by writing

:<math>(\Delta s)^2=(\Delta x^1)^2+(\Delta x^2)^2+(\Delta x^3)^2+(\Delta x^4)^2,</math>

with <math>x^4=ict</math>, '''no one has discovered a way to make an imaginary coordinate work in the general curved spacetime mainifold'''. If "<math>x^4=ict</math>" cannot be used there, it will not be used here. In this chapter and hereafter, '''as throughout the literature of general relativity''', a real time coordinate is used, <math>x^0=t=ct_{conv}</math> (superscript 0 rather than 4 to avoid any possibility of confusion with the imaginary time coordinate)."

::::I admit my knowledge of general relativity isn't very advanced, though I am vaguely aware of the role of the metric, and that is to say it's pretty big.  However, this particular article is on special relativity, and to be fair the ict notation, as weird and possibly unused as it is, exists and is still mooted in classes today, if only as a "oh, yeah, and you can do it this way...".  I am in no way saying that it should be the primary notation used in this article - in fact, any other one should be used :) - but it's worth mentioning, probably with the very caveat you have mentioned.  Basically it's another way to mathematically express special relativity - and more or less only special relativity.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 00:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

::::::O’Barr comments:
It does not matter whether you want to talk about 
SR or GR.  These two theories are the same theory.  
Thus, SR is GR, and GR is SR, in the limit where SR 
applies.  Therefore, if SR is just a math theory, 
then so is GR.  If SR is weak as a theory in the 
domain that it applies, then so is GR weak in this 
same domain.  What is a true failure for SR, is a 
true failure for GR.  Again, this is true as long as 
you are in the limit where SR applies.
You cannot escape any of these relationships.  

Maybe you did not see what I wrote above, where 
it was clearly explained that SR’s 4-D spacetime 
continuum is presently not a scientific concept.  And 
I assure you, if SR is nothing but a simple 3-D 
space, 1-D time reality, then so is GR.  It is 
physically impossible to have reality change from 
being simple 3-D to being 4-D, just because you have 
added gravity gradients to your reality.     

In reading your article on SR, these 3-D and 4-D 
relationships, and absolute and relative 
relationships, are not presented in any scientific 
way, but in a political way, and it is not good 
science.  Math is very powerful and important, and 
the use of 4-D math in SR and GR should be taught and 
used.  But no one needs to think that the math is the 
physics.  That is ludicrous, unless and until a test
can be found that can distinguish these concepts.  

Thanks for reading.
Gerald.

: It looks to me, from the argumentation above, that you and PAR are on the same page about this: the argument against ict is, if I understand it well, that it simply hides the difference between time and space coordinates, without any benefit. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 07:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Gerald, GR and SR are definitely not the same theory! GR was proposed 12 years after SR, Einstein didn't spend all this time waiting around to publish the same theory. GR is accepted to me a more complete description, from which SR can be used under appropriate circumctances (e.g. no curved space). You cannot make assumptions about GR derived from SR. I would also contend that an accurate mathematical prediction often does say something about underlying physics, and you seem to be wrongly applying Occham's razor by saying that a 3-D universe is simpler. Is that because 3 is less than 4? A 3-D universe which acts exactly like a 4-D universe but isn't, is a more complicated explanation than a 4-D universe. If it acts exactly like 4-D, it is 4-D. You can't assume something different based on you seeing the workd in 3-D, you experience time too. Relativity also makes a distinction between space-like and time-like variables.[[User:Jameskeates|Jameskeates]] 08:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

Gerald L. O'Barr comments:
I was very careful in what I said.  I did not say 
these two theories were the same.  I said they were 
the same in the domain where SR applies.  There is a 
difference in what I said and in what you said.  It 
is sad if you are not able to tell that there was a 
difference between what I said and in what you said.     

It is true that there was a time difference 
between the introductions of these two theories.  But 
I assure you, that Einstein made a great effort to 
make these two theories identical in the domain where 
SR applies.  And where SR applies, SR is telling you 
exactly what GR would tell you under these same 
conditions.   

You contend that an accurate mathematical 
prediction often does say something about underlying 
physics.  Contend all you want, but science depends 
upon confirmation by tests, and these confirmations 
must be capable of discriminating between all 
competing theories.  And so far, SR has nothing that 
can discriminate itself from LET and its more simple 
reality.  For your information, 3 is less than 4, the 
last time I checked.  

You can, of course, believe what you want.  But to 
be scientific, where is your science?  Where is your 
test that shows how reality really works?  Since you 
have none, then you are only talking.  

A 3-D reality is simpler than a 4-D reality, no 
matter what the math might show.  Assumptions are 
great, but until there are tests that turn your 
assumptions into solid, repeatable, test results, 
providing clear separations between alternative 
theories, then you do not have a good theory or a 
strong theory.  And those who are not willing to 
understand and to acknowledge such obvious things are 
not good scientists.

== reference frame definition ==

In "Reference frames, coordinates and The Lorentz transformation" section the reference frame is defined as "a point in space at rest, or in uniform motion...".

== Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction ==

An editor made an edit changing "Lorentz contraction" to "Fitzgerald contraction".  I have never heard this effect called the "Fitzgerald contraction".  Admitedly Fitzgerald published it first [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Special_relativity.html], but it was Lorentz who promoted it and got people to notice it.  That is how it became known as the "Lotentz contraction".  The other common title for it is the "[[Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction]]".  Even the "Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction" in the reference web article is an anachronism.

If this editor wants to push this change, then proper csources need to be cited.  The best that I can offer is to refer to [[length contraction]] instead. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:51, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

I do not like the placement of "c" in this section.

There is no point in doing this because one is forced to distinguish between [[contravariant]] and [[covariant]] anyway due to the minus sign.

== Four forces ==

I have some concerns about the following remark.  Rather than spoil an active edit session, I'm going to put my concerns on the talk page and drop a note to the active editor.

:"Force presents a problem because there is no (reasonable) tensor in 4D which contains the components of the 3D force vector among its components."

The [[four-force]] is a reasonable and standard tensor expression for force in SR, and it's even in the Wikipedia (and probably deserves a link). I think a remark explaining how to interconvert the three-force and the four-force would be much more useful than the above remark.  A simple scale factor should not be made so mysterious - if that's the concern.

Possibly there may be other concerns here, a reference or a note here in reply might help clarify matters.
[[User:Pervect|Pervect]] 07:51, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

:As the text of the article correctly says, <math>\vec F = d\vec p/dt</math> is the appropriate notion of force in special relativity. The [[four-force]], to which you referred, is <math>F^\alpha = {dp^\alpha \over d\tau}</math> which is indeed a tensor. However, it is merely the force in the particle's rest frame transformed into the observer's frame. It is not force in the observer's frame in any meaningful sense. Furthermore, if you look at what I said, you will see that the components of the 3-force are NOT components of the four-force. The "scale factor" you mentioned is <math>dt/d\tau = \gamma \!</math> which is NOT an invariant scalar, i.e. it is observer-dependent. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 05:52, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
::The thing which makes momentum physically significant is the fact that it is a conserved quantity (or integral of the motion, as they say). The thing which makes force important is the fact that it is the rate at which this conserved quantity is transferred from one entity to another, i.e. Newton's second and third laws of motion. For this conservation to work, the RATE of transfer must be calculated with respect to the same time coordinate for all entities involved. That is why the Newtonian definition is correct even for special relativity. And that is why "four-force" is useless; its rate is measured with respect to the proper time of each object which varies from object to object (remember the twin paradox). [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 03:48, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

::: Calling the 4-force useless is very WP:POV. It's a standard approach in many textbooks, as well as an existing article crying out for a link.  I think the section as written is too unclear.  I'm going to try rewriting it the way I think it should be written, then we can argue about it more if we must.

::::Dividing by <math>d\tau\!</math> wont work for particles travelling at ''c'' such as photons (in vacuum), gravitons, and neutrinos (for practical purposes). And to integrate the four-force to get the change in momentum you have to keep changing reference frames as the particle accelerates (or go to general relativity and use an accelerating frame reference). With the 3D force, you just stay in the same reference frame and do not worry about whether proper-time is defined or not. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 07:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

::::: Massless particles do not have a rest frame, but then they don't accelerate, either.  One can certainly use four forces to deal with radiation pressure, etc, the fact that the energy and momentum of massless particles depends on their frame is a feature, not a problem.

::::: The four force is a standard textbook approach to forces.  See for instance http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/sr/sr.pdf.  Or any of several other textbooks that take this approach. - any approach that treats forces and uses the 4-vector concept, basically.

::::: I've been waiting a bit to see where you are going with this.  It appears to me that you may be attempting to present some form of the "Lorentz force density".  (Jackson, pg 611).  This works fine for E&M, though it is somewhat complicated to derive.  It does not work in isolation, the definition you are giving is not the correct covariant way to describe a general force.  What the Lorentz force density says is that when an electromagnetic field interacts with charged particles, the energy and momentum locally lost by the field is equal to that gained by the particles it interacts with.  It is not a general definition of force, it does not describe how forces transform covariantly.  The 4-force does that job.

::::: I don't have any objection to putting a discussion of the Lorentz force density in the appropriate place, when fully and properly motivated, but it doesn't belong as the general definition of force, it just doesn't work right, and it's not standard.

:::::: "''Massless particles do not have a rest frame, but then they don't accelerate, either''" - it is not quite correct. Even massless particle can change velocity direction. The equation <math>\frac{d^{2}x^{i}}{d\tau ^{2}} = \alpha F^{ik}\frac{dx_{k}}{d\tau }+g^{i}</math> is still correct to massless particles. Only <math>\tau \,</math> wont be the proper time anymore.--[[User:TxAlien|TxAlien]] 20:10, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

The density of force (which may or may not be Lorentz force) in continuous matter exerted by a force-field is important in its own right and should be mentioned. It is not intended as an alternative to four-force. They apply to different things. Four-force and three-force are applicable to particles or entire objects (if the internal structure is negligible). The density of force is applicable to continuous mediums. The density of force is a tensor (actually covariant 4-vector) density of weight +1 (it is not necessary in SR to distinguish between tensor densities and ordinary tensors) and in SR it transforms like any other covariant 4-vector. This is because the measure of a hyper-volume (dt&middot;dx&middot;dy&middot;dz) is unchanged by a Lorentz transformation, rotation, or translation.

Your statement "Massless particles ... don't accelerate ..." is not accurate. Photons are deflected when they pass thru materials which have a refractive index which varies. And even in a vacuum, gravity can deflect them (although their acceleration is perpendicular to their direction of motion). [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 08:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
:David Hogg's paper gives four-force just one column, doing little more than defining it. He does not use it for anything. I would like you to show me an application of it which cannot be done just as well or better with the three-force. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 08:26, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

===Four force, part 2===

::Photons are deflected by gravity, but they do this because the follow geodesics.  There are not any "forces" involved.  This is as it should be, for the concept of force depends on the frame used, and a photon has no frame.  Matter does change the directions of photons, but this has to be explained in the matter frame, again, photons don't have a frame.

::For starters, try "Griffiths, Introduction to Electrodynamics", where four-forces are called Minkowski forces.  Also, Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, "Gravitation", which uses them a lot, and explains the concept of "geometric objects" on page 48, of which four-forces are an example.   Jackson, "Classical Electrodynamics", uses 4-forces to derive the Faraday tensor (see Force, Lorentz, Covariant form) though otherwise he doesn't use them very much.

::Geometric objects, of which four-forces are an example are quite useful to relativity, i.e the following quote from "Gravitation"/

:::(References) have expounded the mathematical theory of geometric objects.  But to understand or do research in geometrodynamics, one need not master this elegant and beautiful subject.  One need only know that geometric objects in spacetime are entities that exist independently of coordinate systems or reference frames.  A point in spacetime ("event") is a geometric object.  The arrow linking two neighboring events ("vector") is a geometric object in flat spacetime, and its generalization, the "tangent vector", is a geometric object even when spacetime is curved.  The "metric" (machine for producing the squared length of any vector) is a geometric object.  No coordinates are needed to define any of these concepts.

::Four forces are the expression of the concept of force as a geometric object.  It's that simple, ultimately.

::I'm pretty sure Taylor & Wheeler "Spacetime Physics" uses four-forces, but I don't own a copy to double-check.  Most of my SR books are really E&M books - or GR books.

::Return the challenge - name a reference that supports your POV? 

::In the same vein, Re "Density of force". It would be helpful here as well to quote a reference.  I have never seen a reference to "density of force" outside the concept of electromagnetism.  Do you have some reference which supports your usage here?

::The density of energy and momentum expressed as a geometric object is not a 4-vector, but a rank 2 tensor, the stress-energy tensor.  The geometric representation of a volume element is not a scalar, but a vector - the dual vector to a 3-form.  The 3-form represents the volume element, so does its dual.  Basically, a volume can be defined by its magnitude, and the direction of the "time vector" orthogonal to the volume.   Thus "energy / momentum per unit volume" is covariantly expressed as (rank 2 tensor) * (vector representing volume) = (four-vector energy and momentum contained in volume).  This is explained in MTW's "Gravitation".

::One can take the divergence of this stress tensor to come up with a vector.  This turns out to be zero in general <math>\nabla_a T^{ab} = 0</math>, where T is the stress-energy tensor.  So this isn't a very interesting vector, it's zero.  It represents the differential conservation laws of energy and momentum.

::The concept of force density, as I have seen it derived, comes from breaking up the stress-energy tensor T<sup>ab</sup> into two parts, a part representing the stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field, and a part representing the stress-energy tensor of the particles only.    The equation says that the divergence of the field part is equal to the negative of the divergence of the particle part.  This defines the "force density".  To define it in this manner comprehensibly, one must first introduce the stress-energy tensor.  Again, if you have a reference that says differently, it might help clarify what you are trying to say to quote it. [[User:Pervect|Pervect]] 18:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

Modifying the equation at [[geodesic equation]], we get:
:<math>\frac{dp_\mu}{dt} = \Gamma^{\nu}_{\mu\alpha} p_{\nu} \frac{dx^\alpha}{dt} + q F_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^\nu}{dt} + \operatorname{other}\,\operatorname{forces}</math><br>
where ''p''<sup>&mu;</sup> is the 4-momentum at time ''t'' and <math>\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\alpha}</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]].  The Christoffel symbol is the force-field of [[Fictitious force|inertial force]]s, such as gravity, [[centrifugal force]], and [[Coriolis force]]. It is not a tensor. One can say that these forces are a fiction which disguises the curvature of space-time, but this might well be true of all other forces also. The equivalence principle implies that curvature and inertial force are equivalent descriptions of reality.

If you had bothered to read to the bottom of my subsection on electromagnetism, you would see that I mention the stress-energy tensor and show how it is related to the force density. They are two different things. The stress-energy tensor gives the flux of momentum and energy thru a THREE dimensional boundary. While the force density gives the amount of momentum and energy changing form (from electromagnetic to material form, say) within a FOUR dimensional body. You are confusing them and then blaming me for your confusion. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 06:11, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== relativity of simultaneity ==

The [[relativity of simultaneity]] article is in very bad need of attention.  It is currently poorly written, and the last half is an anti-[[Einstein]] diatribe which belongs in [[relativity priority disputes]] if it belongs anywhere in Wikipedia.  I made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relativity_of_simultaneity&oldid=72906534 an attempt to reduce this article to a stub], but other editors objected and reverted it back.

This is an important sub-topic of relativity, and it is a disgrace to have this important article in the hideous shape that it is now in.  I am hoping that others can help me to correct it.

== little help? ==

currently im only a year1 math undergraduate so dont laugh as i ask this. in the section

This suggests what is in fact a profound theoretical insight as it shows that special relativity is simply a rotational symmetry of our space-time, very similar to rotational symmetry of Euclidean space. Just as Euclidean space uses a Euclidean metric, so space-time uses a Minkowski metric. According to Misner (1971 §2.3), ultimately the deeper understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study of the Minkowski metric (described below) rather than a "disguised" Euclidean metric using ict as the time coordinate.

as it says the space of SR uses the Minkowski metric, it doesnt necessarily mean the actually space is a metric space right? because the distance is negative along timelike worldlines, and you have 0 distance between lightlike worldlines so it should be atleast called a pseudo metric space or something. can someone please just say a yes or no to my question? --[[User:I got scammed|I got scammed]] 09:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

:Right. The Minkowski "metric" isn't really a metric, so Minkowski space isn't really a [[metric space]]. —[[User:Keenan Pepper|Keenan Pepper]] 15:35, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

::Just in terms of what words are actually used, I don't know that it's fair to say that it isn't ''really'' a metric.  It's a different kind of metric -- one unlike the metric you talk about in set theory and basic topology.  For example, the metric of Minkowski space is generally only defined with the additional stucture of a vector space.  (Technically, the Minkowski metric never acts on points in spacetime, but on vectors tangent to the spacetime.)  In this context, we're talking about a [[metric tensor]], and usually call something a '''Riemannian''' metric if it's positive-definite or '''pseudo-Riemannian''' if it's not.  Still, in the context of differential geometry, this is usually shortened to just "metric".
::If you're taking topology, it might be of interest to note that the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric is not used to define a metric topology.  Manifolds (spacetimes) usually are given a metric topology, but it's just the usual Euclidean metric used in a suitable way.  Good question, though.  This is a useful distinction to make that is rarely explicitly discussed in textbooks.  [[User:MOBle|MOBle]] 21:11, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

== GA Re-Review and In-line citations ==

Members of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles]] are in the process of doing a re-review of current [[WP:GA|Good Article]] listings to ensure compliance with the standards of the [[WP:WIAGA|Good Article Criteria]]. (Discussion of the changes and re-review can be found [[Wikipedia talk:Good article candidates|here]]). A significant change to the GA criteria is the mandatory use of some sort of in-line citation (In accordance to [[WP:CITE]]) to be used in order for an article to pass the [[WP:V|verification]] and reference criteria. Currently this article does not include in-line citations. It is recommended that the article's editors take a look at the inclusion of in-line citations as well as how the article stacks up against the rest of the Good Article criteria. GA reviewers will give you at least a week's time from the date of this notice to work on the in-line citations before doing a full re-review and deciding if the article still merits being considered a Good Article or would need to be de-listed. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us on the Good Article project [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Good articles|talk page]] or you may contact me personally. On behalf of the Good Articles Project, I want to thank you for all the time and effort that you have put into working on this article and improving the overall quality of the Wikipedia project.

Attributing important claims in the article to a reliable source best accomplishes all that and is simply good form.

<br>
I have to point out some pertinent details from the main policy that has driven this. From [[WP:V]]...''"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."'' Followed by the Section on Burden ''"The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore provide references. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic."''<br>
:Simply put, it is not the readers job to find a mainstream physics book in order to verify any particular aspect of the article. The burden lies squarely with the editors. I think especially with Math and Science articles, the need for in-line citations is even more abundant given the weight of [[WP:OR]]. We have to expect that a significant portion of this article's readership will be "non-experts" as well and they would have no way of knowing that these are ''mainstream with physics''. The attaching of a reliable source will at least give creed to that notion. In all honestly, this is not new. It is something that the foundational wikipedia guidelines have asked for all along and in a time when Jimbo and the rest of the Wikipedia community are steering towards more quality over quantity, the GA project is moving accordingly. I don't doubt the truth of this article or that it is mainstream physics. But it has never been about truth but rather verifiability. [[User:Agne27|Agne]] 17:39, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

=== just another header ===

I really don't understand the opposition to in-line citations here.  There are statements in this article refering to pre-relativity ideas, and others that refer to consequences and elaborations on the theory that were discovered after June, 1905.  (For example, [[E=mc²]] was initially propsed in late 1905, and the tensor represtantation was pioneered by [[Hermann Minkowski]] in 1908.)  Even those items that relate to the 1905 article are often more effectively described and elaborated on it respected textbooks.

:Part of the problem is that it is not clear to me how many citations are necessary. After I rewrote the subsection on "Electromagnetism in 4D", I put my source ''Formal Structure of Electomagnetics: General Covariance and Electromagnetics'' by E.J.Post into the list of references and I thought that that would be sufficient. Now you are telling me that I have to convert it into a footnote? (Which I do not know how to do.)

:@EMS: Important historical information has to be put in prose, not in footnotes alone.

I fully support the inclusion of in-line citations to this (and all) articles at Wikipedia. Agne and EMS have made their points very clear about this, and I agree with those points. I have recently been incorporating in-line citations to articles, in particular, [[general relativity]] (which, in general terms, should be an article similar to special relativity). Editors may wish to look at this article for the sort of approach to citations I think we should be aiming for. Also have a look at [[tests of general relativity]]. [[User:MathPhys|MP]]  [[User_talk:MathPhys | (talk)]] 15:15, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

:I came here after reading Pjacobi's comment on [[WP:Cite]], and although I have sympathy for the constructors of excellent articles like the one here, I don't agree that adding citations is particularly difficult or unnecessary. Yes, the blue tags look a little ugly, but as Wikipedia moves into the new referencing era (references are the only way to build trust in an encyclopedia still thought to be a dubious source of information), I'm sure it won't be long until the tags and footnotes are hideable. Though some editors may object, I suspect there is no turning back with this one, so it's worth trying to get up to pace.

:I should say that I'm a nobody on Wikipedia, unconnected with any of the work behind these new policies. But my opinion is that there should always be referenced information about the historical context of any scientific article; in particular, the big breakthroughs should be referenced. The best references for these would probably not be textbooks but rather the most authoritative biographies of scientists or studies of particular scientific developments or movements. When it comes to explaining basic scientific processes, on the other hand, the best references would probably be the best or the standard textbooks. The fact that there might be thousands of textbooks explaining the same thing should make it easier, not more diffcult, to give a reference. As long as a textbook is known to be reliable, it doesn't matter which one is referred to at all.

:The trouble is that this will all seem like a drag and will of course take time. In the case of the present article, much of the necessary information seems present in linked articles on the papers and on the history of relativity, however; even so, each article should, I think, be referenced in itself, even if the same reference has to be remade on linked pages. I imagine that the people who write and edit these articles have good reference books on their shelves at home with which they could easily bring articles like this back up to good-article requirement. For those who are not used to it, referencing is not hard to learn at all, and it can actually be good fun; the best references, in my opinion are those which give page numbers. The question of where to reference is a matter of common sense. For example, if several sentences in an article can be referenced from a particular page or sequence of pages in a book, it is enough to give one reference; the reader who checks the reference will soon see what part of the article that part of the book verifies. (References, of course, are not intended to verify truth; they verify that what we say in the article was already said by someone else in print.)

===Did she get one right?===

Looking over the items which Agne27 marked with "citation needed", I have to agree that most of them are common knowledge among physicists. However, there is one (second paragraph of "Status") which I doubt, namely "Because of the freedom one has to select how one defines units of length and time in physics, it is possible to make one of the two postulates of relativity a tautological consequence of the definitions, but one cannot do this for both postulates simultaneously, as when combined they have consequences which are independent of one's choice of definition of length and time.".

== Tests of special relativity page ? ==

Is there a page which discusses [[tests of special relativity]] (analogous to [[tests of general relativity]])? - guess not. Perhaps there should be, and it would be a good article for at least 2 reasons: 

* it would collect together the experiments used to test SR, thus making for better organisation. 
* it would be in a more consistent format with the general relativity pages regarding experiments (and there would be some nice overlap too, e.g. [[Hafele-Keating experiment]]). There's even a category, [[:Category:Tests of general relativity]].

A useful website that lists papers for experiments in SR is the following: http://www2.corepower.com:8080/~relfaq/experiments.html. [[User:MathPhys|MP]]  [[User_talk:MathPhys | (talk)]] 14:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

== Causal Paradox is not adequately explained ==

It is not enough to show that there exists a frame where the cause happens after the effect. This is explained in detail [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0107091 here] on page 11-13.

The problem is that you can't define cause and effect using temporal ordering. You would have to invoke an "arrow of time" but at the fundamental level there exists no such thing.

You have to show that you can create a situation where the effect precedes the cause and that the separation between the two is timelike. Only then do you have a genuine paradox (e.g. the Tachyonic anti-telephone mentioned in the article). [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 18:17, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

== Reasoning for Fact tags placed ==

''I apologize for the delay. We had a "kitten death" in the family and I had to tend to the little ones''<br>

The inclusions of the tags were in response to ScienceApologist request made on my talk page from September 26. ''"Offering helpful criticisms like "please include references for the following facts:" is appreciated.''" and  Kjoonlee's request on this talk page ''"OK, I've had a look at the article, and there's not a <nowiki> {{citation needed}} or {{fact}}</nowiki> template in sight. Specifically, what sort of cites do we need?"'' So I responded to those requests. The items I tagged where items that I felt, as a layperson, I would like to be able to verify. I didn't tag the items because I thought they were "false" or "incorrect." I don't doubt the science behind the article or expertise of the editors who watch and maintain this article. But without the benefit of in-line cites, we reach a brickwall when it comes to verifying these items by us non-experts. My concern is for the day when there might not be an expert to watch and maintain this page. What are we to do then? An in-line cite would go a long way towards ''maintaining'' the accuracy of this article long after each of you are gone because it allows laypersons to aid in the upkeep. [[User:Agne27|Agne]] 23:29, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

:: Most of the points that were tagged follow directly from the postulates of special relativity. In most textbooks they are either derived explicitely or its in some exercise that the student is supposed to do. I.m.o. all that needs to be done is to give a ref. in the beginning of the article to one or more comprehensive textbooks. If you give a ref to all the points that are not imediately clear to a lay pesrson then you get a large number of refs to the same textbooks, which is rather ugly.

:: In scientific articles where you need to include an important reference to a review article which you are going to use, it is customary to give that reference once at the beginning and then you can freely use it without giving an inline reference at at every sentence. You say, e.g. "we now use the method given in [1]. We define bla bla bla", but you don't write bla [1] bla [1] bla [1] etc. :-).

:: The way to verify that there is no OR or nonsense is to ask for a review of the article by contacting the wiki physics project members. There is no other way, because even if the refs are included, someone could have changed the contents of the statements. If you are not able to do the maths and see if the statements are correct, then you are unlikely to be able to verify it from a textbook. Textbooks are not just a collection of statements, but they do require the reader to through the math etc.  [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 02:33, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

:::::: I now started working on a replacement for the "Anti-relativity" article. The new title may be "Opposition to the theory of relativity" but, perhaps better, "Criticism of the theory of relativity" (for how can anyone ''oppose'' a theory?). What do you think? It should focus on criticisms by notable "dissidents", instead of on dissidents themselves or on unknown crackpots. I had a look at [[limitations of special relativity]] but saw nothing that IMO is worth salvaging. When I get to the point of placing the new article draft, I will immediately (or even upfront) ask for partial protection as a crackpot barrier.

== A link to “Non-postulated relativity” ==

Hello everyone,

I did not want to open a discussion about incorporating a single reference (link), but someone deleted this link twice, without providing any explanations.  So, I would like to include a reference to the book “Non-postulated relativity” by Lev Lomize [http://www.nonpostulatedrelativity.com/].  A different version of this book has been already published in the Soviet Union in 1991 (“From high school physics to Relativity”, Prosveshenie, Moscow, 70,000 copies).  The publication was supported by theoreticians from the Lebedev Institute of Physics in Moscow. The book was partially rewritten, translated to English, and made available by the author as a PDF file, because Lev Lomize believed that information must be freely available to everyone.  That is why I think Wikipedia is an appropriate place to make this reference.  

I want to emphasize that author did not try to disprove anything in Special Relativity.  To the contrary, he explains why this theory is so valid, although he does that in a highly innovative way.  Well, may be his way of presenting Special Relativity is not entirely new, since the similar ideas were shared by Einstein, Janossy, Feinberg and others, as explained in the last chapter of the book by Lev Lomize.  I am only sure that his explanation of relativity of simultaneity is completely innovative.  Like Janossy, he is talking about limitations of Special Relativity in the end of his book, but every physical theory has certain limitations. 

I know that there are numerous books about Special Relativity.  So, why include a reference to this one?  I think because this book is very special.  To explain, I can only cite Lev, with some omissions (Lev passed away recently):
''“In 1991, the Russian version of this book was published under the name "From High School Physics to Relativity." This book was written after a life time of searching for an explanation of special relativity, which would answer childish questions, such as "What makes the moving rod shorter and the moving clock slow? If the postulates somehow do it, what is the mechanism they use 
for doing so?"'' 
''The first hint came out when I was conducting my early theoretical research on the electromagnetic radiation of a bunched beam of charged particles. With the Maxwell equations taken as a starting point for the derivations, I decided to “simplify” the problem by neglecting relativistic “corrections” which were supposed to be made later on. To my extreme surprise, the relativistic “corrections” turned up from the derivations automatically – just by themselves – as though Maxwell had known about relativity. Neither did Newton know about relativity when formulating his universal laws of motion, which are successfully used all over the world in the computations on beam dynamics of relativistic bunches of particles whose speed is very close to that of light. It was Newton who had formally treated the mass in his second law as though it could depend on the velocity. Time and again I had a great pleasure to track down the classical way of explaining relativistic effects without using Einstein’s postulates.'' 

''At the first stage of this research, I regarded it as a part of my self-education. But in 1974, I suddenly discovered that I was not alone in my attempts to build a bridge between classical physics and relativity. E.L. Feinberg, one of the best scientific minds in Russia, involved in his research in the field of quantum electrodynamics, spared some of his valuable time to clarify the issue. Supported by V.L. Ginzburg and other theorists from the Lebedev Institute of Physics (Moscow, USSR), in 1974, he published a clear and instructive article devoted to this topic. A thorough inspection of the literature revealed a very interesting history of the issue, starting even from Einstein himself. This inspection convinced me of the need for a new special book that would explain the main relativistic effects in terms of classical physics. “Non-Postulated Relativity” has been written as a fair approximation to it. Only the aberration of light and the longitudinal Doppler effect were not included here in order not to distract the reader from the main ideas. “''

Does this sound very strange for some of you? Do you have a lot of questions? Do you disagree?  That is precisely why I think this book is so important for understanding Special Relativity.  Note that the book is written for undergraduate students, but it takes a lot of effort to read and understand. 

Of course, we could argue forever about different scientific topics described in this book.  But this is not the point.  The point is that reference to this book is in complete compliance with guidelines of Wikipedia.  The guidelines say: 
''“The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth”'' (so we should not judge who is right and who is wrong), and it says that authors of publishes books are considered as most reliable sources.  I know that authors of different books often cotradict each other.  But this is fine.  Let’s cite many sources to present alternative interpretations, especially if they are interesting and novel.  “Divided we stand, united we fall”. 
	
So, if you do not have any serious objections, I would like to include this link. [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 18:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the reference! At first sight, Lomize's approach has some similarities with that of Bell's "how to teach relativity", and I agree that readers can benefit from such presentations - for example I myself would certainly have benefitted from Bell's presentation if I had not already read similar papers before. But I wonder if there aren't a few significant errors in Lomize's book. Can you be more precise about the original Russian version, You say below that the editor is "Prosveshenie", can you be more precise, maybe with a link to the editor's website? 
:: Apart of that, the phrase you copied refers to topics and not to references. Following your use of “The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth”, we should certainly include Bell's article as well - and also the zillions of other articles and books about SRT - right? Of course that's not doable, so an editor's pick is needed. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 19:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

: No. After a cursory examination of the theory the link refers to, I already found serious flaws with it.  It will in no way help anyone understand Special Relativity. [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 19:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

::I am a new person in Wikipedia. So, can someone help me out?  I have two technical questions.  ''First'', Tailpig is obviously mistaken.  There is at least one person who understood Special Relativity better after reading this book. This is me. There are many more. Would you like them to take part in this discussion? Would it help? Those people could tell their names and scientific backgrounds. How many positive opinions do you need to include the reference? So, if a few other people will say "Yes", can I incorporate the reference, or this "No" of a single anonymous person means "No" forever? ''Second'', can I make myself a new Wikipedia article, such as "Non-postulated relativity" by Lev Lomize to explain his ideas? Is that a better way to proceed?[[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 23:00, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
:::But are you sure you understand special relativity really better? Or do you now have some twisted idea about special relativity? So, I think you are not qualified to say Tailpig is mistaken. If you'd seen another person get a better grasp of it (and you would be adequately equipped to judge that), then you'd have the right to say that. [[User:Errabee|Errabee]] 23:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:::(After edit conflict) Neither of these is a good way to proceed.  Non-standard treatments of SR are not going to be a good thing to add to this article, and bringing in people to agree with you won't change the regular editors' opinions on this.  See [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry#Meatpuppets]].  Also, creating a separate article is not a good way to proceed; a new approach to physics with no [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal]] publications would not be a good addition to Wikipedia. -- [[User:SCZenz|SCZenz]] 23:24, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:::Wikipedia as a tertiary source tries to stay away from primary sources such as this link.  See [[WP:NOR]].  Wait for Lev Lomize's theory to be properly peer reviewed.  There are too many amateur scientific theories to include them in this article.  However, Wikipedia is a democracy and so I will not remove the link if the majority of editors agree to include it. [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 23:39, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
::::I've just been corrected, Wikipedia is indeed [[WP:NOT|NOT]] a democracy. [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 23:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Tailpig, I also mistook "primary source" to mean what you think, indeed it can lead to much confusion. A review book such as the one here discussed is a ''secondary'' source. Personal notes by him in a letter would be an example of "primary source". BTW it is adviced not to base a Wikipedia article on primary sources, but primary sources may certainly be ''used'' in articles. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 19:41, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::::: Whether we see it as a review book (''secondary'' source) or an individual's own original research (''primary'' source) doesn't matter much in this case.  There are enough external links to good books in the article.  [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 20:32, 26 October 2006 (UTC) 

::::: Thank you all for your participation!  I only would like to emphasize that this book of Lev is not a primary source!  The English vesrion of the book (it includes an additional new historic chapter) indeed has not been peer reviewed. However, this is basically only a translation of the Russian version, which has been reviewed extensively by the very best physicists who worked in the Lebedev Institute of Physics of Soviet Academy of Sciences (FIAN), including Dr. [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] (the winner of the Nobel Prize), Dr.B. Bolotovsky,  Dr. E.L. Feinberg (a member of Russian Academy of Sciences), Prof. G.Y. Mjakishev (author of physics textbooks, he is well known in Russia) and several others.  If it helps, I might be able to obtain some of their reviews on the book and translate them to English. Some of these people asked for the new translated version of Lev's book (this English version was printed in Ann Arbor), and he send signed copies to them.   Lev also had a discussion with Academician [[Andrei Sakharov]] who was able to understand his ideas very quickly.  As far as I know, this work of Lev has not been initially accepted by some of these highly qualified people. So, he had to make a couple of presentations in FIAN to explain and justify his ideas. Finally, everyone was convinced that he is right, and the book was published (the state publishing organization, Prosveshenie, required an approval from the very top of the scientific community).  So, if you find this possible, please reconsider. I just thought that putting Lev's work in Wikipedia would be a good tribute to the person who I deeply respect and admire.[[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 01:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::: I should add that Lev had close to 100 publications, but most of them were published either long time ago in Soviet journals or as materials with a limited access. He worked in a top secret scientific institution and was allowed to leave this place and move abroad only after his retirement. Two unpiblished papers on his web site are related to the work on the non-postulated relativity, which was his hobby. [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 03:12, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::::Could you provide a verifiable reference that Dr. [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] reviewed this book? [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 02:58, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::::: Thank you, Tailpig! Yes, I think this may be possible. But will that be enough? [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] is a very busy person, so I would not like to bother him without a good reason. What would you need? Lev's friends in Moscow who work in FIAN could ask him to write down a very brief letter about Lev's book, or just say a statement that, yes, he knows this book and approved it for the publication.  Would e-mail from one of Ginzburg's associates in FIAN be enough (or may be they can visit Wikipedia and leave a message here?), or you need something like FAX with Ginzburg's signature?   [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 03:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::::I'm only asking for a reference out of curiosity. I have doubts that Dr. Ginzburg actually [[peer review]]ed the book.  It's not enough to approve it for publication as that does not consist as a peer review. [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 04:23, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::Dear Tailpig, I looked through Wikipedia article about [[peer review]]. My understanding is that, yes, the book has been peer reviewed by a large group of highly qualified people. Note that peer review is not necessarily done by persons who are anonymous, but it should be done by persons who are authorites in the field. The book was reviewed by the best authorities in the field in the Sovied Union at the moment of publication, and who are widely recognized as such worldwide. So, I am asking you and others: is it enough if [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] will send an e-mail (to the address you tell to me or to someone in FIAN) or go to Wikipedia and state that Lev's book in fact has been peer reviewed and that he is sure that this book by Lev Lomize is correct and great? He was one of the persons who requested the paper copy of the English translation. He has it. So, even if he was not a peer reviewer of the Russian edition (I think he was), are his credentials sufficient to serve as a peer reviewer of the English edition for Wikipedia? [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 15:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::I personally have published many papers in scientific journals. Of course I know who most of the reviewers were, even though they supposed to be anonymous. Never the reviewers were so outstandig specialists in my field, as those who reviewed Lev's work in his field. The reason is very simple: these people are too busy to review anything except studies that are very interesting and important for them personally. Lev's work was extraordinary interesting and important for them.[[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 15:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::I just found out that an official peer review has indeed been conducted by the state publishing company Prosveshenie ("Education"). Main person who was responsible for this review and final decision was professor G.Y. Miakishev who pulished previously a book "Forces in Nature" (in Russian) and therefore was trusted by the publishing company.  If he is alive, it could appropriate to inquire him about the reviewing process. My understanding is that he wanted Dr. Ginzburg, Bolotovskiy and others to serve as reviewers, after looking through Lev's book himself very carefully. I was told that G.Y. Miakishev called to Lev several times during reading the book, ones thinking that he found an error. But it was not there. Finally, Dr. Miakishev was very enthusiastic of the book and wanted best people to read it.  [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 15:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::The article cannot have a link to a book that still uses [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] to try to explain Special Relativity.  This was proven wrong over a hundred years ago.  As for a verifiable reference that Dr. Ginzburg reviewed this book, an e-mail or Wikipedia posting is not verifiable.  Since you've dealt with scientific journals and have published many papers, you should know what I mean when I ask for a verifiable source.  Are there any reputable scientific journals that reviewed this book?  Any verifiable evidence Dr. Ginzburg peer-reviewed this book? [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 16:05, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

:::: Would a FAX with a signature from Drs. Ginzburg or Miakishev be such a verifiable evidence? Then tell me FAX number. How can scientific journals review a book?  You either publishing a paper in a journal or prepare a book for publication. In the latter case, the publishing agency is probably responsible for the peer reviewing process, although I have never published a book. Of course, Lev does not say that [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] exists in his book!!! Is that the reason you think this book is wrong? He discusses this question in a historical context, and also he uses this to explain everything more clearly for the readers. "Let's imagine for a second that aether does exist. What is then?" Of course, such explanations are appropriate. Dr. Ginzburg and others understood that.  To the contrary, Lev says that aether does NOT exist, it "fades away". You are welcome to ask any other scientific questions about this book.[[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 16:43, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::A FAX is not a verifiable reference.  This is not the place to discuss this book.  This discussion is over.  It lasted long enough and we're still left with a book, on a webpage, with no verifiable scientific backing.
::::Just for kicks, can you get Dr. Ginzburg to post here '''"that he is sure that this book by Lev Lomize is correct and great"'''? [[User:Tailpig|Tailpig]] 17:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::Nasty ;-)
:::::Here's another kick from page 266:
::::::''"The kind of elasticity we are concerned with is a much more general notion than the ordinary elasticity as used in mechanics. It refers even to such a non-classical object as a single electron. Let us place an electron in the electric field which is so strong that the electron is accelerated up to the speed of light earlier than its mass has time to grow and prevent the electron from overcoming the light barrier. Will this electron reach the speed of light in vacuum? “Surprisingly”, it will. How strong must be that field? An approximate calculation shows that it must be close to the electric field on the “surface” of the positron which “comes in touch” with the electron, both of them regarded as classical spherical objects of the size about their classical radius. Their contact with each other brings about the well-known result. Both of them successfully reach the light barrier and convert into a pair of photons, which gladly fly away with the speed of light."''
:::::[[User:DVdm|DVdm]] 17:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::::You did not answer my question: what kind of verifiable reference do you need? Of course I can ask Dr. [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] and explain him this situation in Wikipedia. Please tell me to whom in Wikipeda his letter should be addressed and where to put the letter. I am not playing games here. In his book, Lev describes a number of imaginary situations to explain the underlying physics better, such as the existence ot aether, movements with the speed of light or faster, and so.  Of course, he does not mean that all such things really take place, as I said about the aether.  You should also remember that he had to simplify everything, because the book was written for beginners, althouth it actually takes a lot of effort and critical thinking to read and understand. One should read the entire text to understand, as peer reviewers did. [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 18:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::::: Dear Friends! I understand that you are very busy, and I am sorry for bothering all of you here. Please let me explain why I was so persistent. I dedicated my life to science, and I know how important and difficult the scientific knowledge is. I have PhD in physics and I red this book. I know (like Dr. [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] and others) that this book explains a lot of very important things that can not be found in any other sources.  Unfortunately, very few people in USA or Europe knows anything about this book. This happened because Lev Lomize could not promote his ideas, because he worked in a secret institute, being prevented from any contacts with foreigners or leaving the country. He came to US too late.  So what I actually wanted was to provide an opportunity for American and other scientists to learn about the existence of this book. Then, anyone could read it and decide for himself is it right or wrong. Remember, we are not talking here about anyone who is trying to disprove the Theory of Relativity or other crazy things. [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 18:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::I agree. Let's finish this discussion. I am not going to bother Dr.Ginzburg or others "just for kiks" as Tailpig said. I also agree with SCZenz who said that "a new approach to physics with no [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal]] publications would not be a good addition to Wikipedia". The point is: the approach Lev is talking about is not something completely new.  This is something  [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Albert Einstein]], Ives, Janossy, Feinberg and others were thinking about (as described by Lev). And as such, this subject certainly deserves a separate Wikipedia article. One of possible titles for such article would be "Relativity based on physical reality" as Janossy said.  I hope that the book by Janossy is a good source for Wikipedia, although it is much more difficult to read and understand then book by Lev. Actually, this is not a single article, because each relativistic effect should be presented and explained as a separate sub-article. So, ''I have to ask for help from other people who are  better qualified then me to do this job for Wikipedia, some of them perhaps from Russia and Israel'' [[User:Biophys|Biophys]] 13:38, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Physics in spacetime ==

Perhaps the article could be split by moving most of the ''Physics in spacetime'' section to a new article. Comments please. [[User:MathPhys|MP]]  [[User_talk:MathPhys | (talk)]] 14:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
:Why? I do not see the point of making such a separation. However, if it is done, the subsection "Electromagnetism in 4D" (of section "Relativity and unifying electromagnetism") which was originally part of section "Physics in spacetime" should go with it because that subsection depends on notation defined in "Physics in spacetime". [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 06:40, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

::''Why?'' - because the average reader of this article will not gain a true understanding of the role of spacetime physics in SR. There is just too much maths in that section (and possibly other sections) that for nonspecialists it will be off-putting. If we are to keep the section on spacetime physics, then a less mathematically verbose version should be used. [[User:MathPhys|MP]]  [[User_talk:MathPhys | (talk)]] 17:43, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:::I think the issue boils down to what do you want a reader to be able to know/learn without vector-matrix/vector-tensor notation/mathematics which isn't already explained in previous sections of the article?  As far as I can tell from a quick glance, the article covers the bases of relativity pretty well as far as physical description goes.  The space-time sections don't, I think, add any new physical behaviors, but just give you a new and innovative way of looking at the physics (that is that positions in time and space and movement though the same can actually be thought of as pretty much the same thing, and not two different things).  Perhaps there needs to be a better bridge between the sections on the algebraic, non-space-time way of looking at relativity and the sections on the tensor-based, space-time way of looking at relativity pointing out that though the math looks different, there's really nothing very new in terms of phenomena.  Time will still dilate and lengths will still contract, and so forth.  Without tensor math, space-time relativity could probably be summed up in a paragraph or two.  But the real advantage is in using that math, and though the notation is odd to people who haven't seen it, it's not *that* complex (there's no calculus, the equations are pretty short, and they all correspond to algebraic equations which are already explained and which can be referrenced if necessary).
:::I should also point out that there is an article which is supposed to take an even simpler approach (the Introduction... article).  But in the end, aside from perhaps something of a disclaimer saying "Okay, now things get a little more complicated, but this is all just a different way of writing what's already been explained in a way that suggests a different way of looking at things, which is...", where a couple of sentences explaining the gist of the space-time view follows.  Anyway, that's my opinion.  [[User:Ssiruuk25|DAG]] 22:04, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
::::The articles in Wikipedia are supposed to address readers at many different levels of sophistication. Generally, one begins with the simpliest and most intuitive version and works up to the more esoteric and mathematical stuff. These sections are at the end of this article for that reason.

== Sign Convention ==

Have we formed a consensus on the sign convention?  From other articles, it looks like the signature is mostly -+++.  That's definitely the one I prefer -- spinors notwithstanding.  It's also the predominant one in current GR literature.  This is important.  Most notably, it affects many components.  We need to decide on one convention, and stick to it thoroughly.  Among other things, we need to make sure that it carries through in expressions for components of the four-current, for example.  --[[User:MOBle|MOBle]] 16:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
: I think we just need to make clear what convention is used in the article and to what one needs to pay attention to if one switches from one to the other convention. We also need to get rid of c everywhere. You can do the unit conversions before and/or after you use an equation. It is better to explain these issues so that readers can learn and understand it, instead of protecting the reader against having to deal with changing conventions, changing units etc. etc. [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 16:42, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
:: I have reasons to prefer +---, but I admit this it is non-standard.  I advise choosing conventions on the signature (which should be -+++ unless of good case can be made for doing otherwise) and whether ''c'' should apprear in the equations or not.  In the later case, I usually omit ''c'', but given that people are using this article to learn about SR I feel that it's omission only will make a difficult subject even harder to handle. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 17:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
::: About c, we could define x_{0} to be c t instead of t as is done now in the "Physics in spacetime" section. People reading that part of the article surely are able to understand how to put back c and if you put x_{0} = ct that's going to help. [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 17:37, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
::::Landau & Lifshitz, Jackson, Bjorken & Drell, Peskin & Schroeder all use +---. I think +--- is thus pretty standard, or at least it is certainly not non-standard. Peskin & Schroeder say that their conventions follow nearly all recent field theory texts.[[User:LeBofSportif|LeBofSportif]] 18:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::Hmm... This might be true.  I admittedly come with a bias for the GR convention.  (Anyone giving a GR talk without spinors and with +--- would be laughed out of the room.)  I think the newest version of Jackson may have switched to the "reasonable" -+++.  I like the idea of using x_0=ct.  However, as the anon seems to be pointing out, it is more standard to use upper indices on coordinates.  (I also like the anon's use of <math>d\sigma</math>.)  --[[User:MOBle|MOBle]] 18:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::: Using upper indices on coordinates is the correct thing to do.  To obtain a scalar (such as <math>ds^2</math>) from a tensor with subscripted indices (such as the metric tensor <math>g_{\mu\nu}</math>) you need to use tensors with superscripted idices (such as <math>x^\mu</math>).  Personally, I prefer to name my coordinates (i.e., [''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'']) and let that be that. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
::::::: It will be particularly unkind to the majority of readers to use anything else but the usual units of physics (x, y, z, t). No more than that is required to explain SRT, and it is good practice to keep the standard physics units -- which includes c in m/s. IMO all physics articles in Wikipedia should keep the international units standard. [[User:Harald88|Harald88]] 22:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::::: I'll take issue with this, but only slightly.  In more advanced articles (and especially GR-related ones), ''c'' becomes a bothersome nuisance.  So I would permit some flexibility in terms of whether to omit ''c'' or not.  OTOH, for any article where a firm understanding of relativity is not a necessary prerequisite (such as this one), I agree 100% with Harald that omitting ''c'' is unkind.  People need to be brought in one step at a time.  This article necessarily covers a lot of ground for readers trying to get a handle on SR.  Bringing in anything which is not absolutely necessary truly is a disservice to the readers. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 04:32, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
::::::::: For the first half of the article, roughly till "The geometry of space-time" that's ok. But in the later sections, defining x0 = ct will help. Now you have c^2 (c^(-2)) covariant (contravariant) metric tensor. The people who are going to read that stuff will be helped by eliminating c. Also, note that in the section "Electromagnetism in 4D" c has been set to 1. And I don't think anyone wants to switch to SI units and insert the conversion factors epsilon_0 and mu_0 everywhere there :) [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 14:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

::::::::::: I haven't added to a discussion page before so I'm sorry if I mess up the insetion. Anony is right. This section is a mess. Instead of addressing all points though, I’ll just give my input on the sign convention. When doing physics there are many conventions that are left up to the choice of the practitioner. Many conventions are very standard, but some still have no general consensus. In relativity there is a sign convention for the metric that is somewhat not agreed on, but I will argue should be +---. First I will give you the ONLY reason that it is sometimes taken to be -+++ and then show why this is a bad choice. In non-relativistic Euclidean physics the line element describing distance along a path is given by  <math>d\sigma </math> in <math>d\sigma ^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}</math> In special relativity there is an invariant interval between events which can be described in terms of an invariant line element ds, which looks much like this with the exception that it must include a time differential with the opposite sign of the other terms in order to be invariant. In other words <math>-(dx^{0})^{2} + d\sigma ^{2}</math> where <math>x^{0} = ct</math> is invariant, but also <math>d\sigma ^{2} - (dx^{0})^{2}</math> is invariant.  So the question is then which way should we define <math>ds^{2}</math>. Minkowski unfortunately chose the former merely for the only reason that the interval would look more like the Euclidean line element that he was used to dealing with. Which led him to the erroneous(which I will demonstrate) conclusion that time is an imaginary spatial coordinate.  This was the wrong thing to do and is unfortunately carried on in too many papers and texts involving relativistic metrics.  Here’s the first reason. Squared lengths of vectors for real physical quantities become negative. The inner product of four-vectors A and B involves the metric <math>A \cdot B = g_{\mu \nu }A^{\mu }B^{\nu }</math> So for example the squared length of the momentum four-vector in special relativity is <math>p \cdot p = \eta _{\mu \nu}p^{\mu }p^{\nu }</math> and with the +--- convention that yields a positive result <math> \eta _{\mu \nu}p^{\mu }p^{\nu } = (\frac{E}{c})^{2} - (p)^{2} = (mc)^{2}</math> It is nice that the mass is the length of the momentum four-vector and not imaginary times mass,  which would have been the case if we chose -+++. As another example consider the velocity four-vector. <math>U \cdot U = g_{\mu \nu }U^{\mu }U^{\nu }</math> With the +--- convention the length of the velocity four-vector is the speed of light. <math>g_{\mu \nu }U^{\mu }U^{\nu } = c^{2}</math> This yields an elegant interpretation of relativity that all things travel in 4d spacetime at the speed of light, merely rotated in direction in spacetime by four-forces. Thats why four-force is always perpendicular to four-velocity. <math>g_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu }U^{\nu } = 0</math> It would be awfully inconvenient if the interpretation had to be that all things traveled through 4d spacetime with imaginary velocity because we chose -+++ for no good reason.  Heres the second reason.  It leads to the erroneous interpretation of time as an imaginary spatial coordinate instead of associated imaginary with the spatial coordinates with which it now obviously belongs. Consider for a moment the 2x2 identity and the three Pauli matrices. The square of the 2x2 identity is identity is <math>\sigma _{0}^{2} = \sigma _{0}</math> The square of any other Pauli matrix is minus one times identity. <math>\sigma _{i}^{2} = - \sigma _{0}</math> Lets see how these would affect physics if we let them serve as a component of an orthonormal basis with the 2x2 identity associated with time. It is not imaginary that is associated with time. It is imaginary in the Pauli matrices that is associated with space. A displacement vector <math>\mathbf{ds}</math> in space and time with these associations is <math>\mathbf{ds} = \sigma_{0}(dx^{0})\mathbf{e_0} + \sigma_{x}dx\mathbf{e_x} + \sigma_{y}dy\mathbf{e_y} + \sigma_{z}dz\mathbf{e_z}</math> and the square of that displacement vector without using the metric this time as its effect is imbedded in the Pauli matrices is <math>(\mathbf{ds}^{2}) = \mathbf{1}ds^{2} = \mathbf{1}((dx^{0})^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2})</math> Minkowski associated imaginary with the wrong coordinate, BECAUSE he chose the wrong sign convention.[[User:WaiteDavid137|WaiteDavid137]] 17:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

At one time, I favored +--- because time is the direction in which the world-lines of particles are extended. However, I subsequently switched to -+++ because it is more similar to non-relativistic physics. In every-day life (and experimental physics), we use the Newtonian viewpoint and just add on relativistic corrections. So the mathematics we use should be designed to make that easy. Theoretical physics is frankly less important. The speed of light in a vacuum ''c'' should be retained for the same reason and to conform to the [[SI units]]. However, as I did in the section on physics in space-time, I think we should use ''t'' (in seconds) as the time coordinate instead of ''c t'' (in meters or Plank lengths or whatever). So the ''c'' will appear in the metric tensor. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 12:05, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:To Count Iblis: I am responsible for the most recent version of "Electromagnetism in 4D". Although ''c'' does not appear explicitly in the equations, it was not my intension to set it to one. On the contrary, I intended to use [[SI units]]. The speed of light in a vacuum appears implicitly within the <math>\eta \!</math>s in the constitutive equation and that is the only place that it is needed. And the [[permeability (electromagnetism)]] of vacuum is used only in that equation while the [[permittivity]] of the vacuum is entirely eliminated.

== Suggested addition to Postulates section ==

Since this is the technical article on SR, I think it might be a good idea to mention in the postulates section that special relativity can and has been derived without the use of the second postulate (that is, certain minimal assumptions about space-time symmetry and smoothness are sufficient). This is not crackpot science, but has been known for quite a while - cited in secondary references such as Purcell's classic Electricity & Magnetism textbook, which refers to the peer-reviewed and oft-cited article David Mermin "Relativity Without Light" (American Journal of Physics -- February 1984 -- Volume 52, Issue 2, pp. 119-124). This is an important observation because it underscores the generality of relativity and deemphasizes the connection between relativity and E&M which, while historically important, is not fundamental to the theory - relativity is not a consequence of E&M, but a higher-order theory describing how _all_ physical theories must behave, after all. The present wording seems misleading (too categorical) in this sense. Alternatively a statement that the two postulates given constitute the _historical_ set, and not the only one possible, might also be sufficient. Anyway, I'm interested in comments and/or objections; I can provide more references upon request.

: There's a very good online textbook that does this as well. Section 10.8 "Relativity without c" of [http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~phys16/Textbook/ch10.pdf David Morin's textbook Mechanics and Special Relativity]
: With the principle of relativity alone (without the light speed postulate) you can prove that there is a limiting speed V for objects, finite or infinite. 
: Conclusion on page X-38: 
:: ''Note that all of the finite 0 < V^2 < infinity possibilities are essentially the same. Any difference in the numerical definition of V can be absorbed into the definitions of the unit sizes for x and t. Given that V is finite, it has to be something, so it doesn’t make sense to put much importance on its numerical value. There is therefore only one decision to be made when constructing the spacetime structure of an (empty) universe. You just have to say whether V is finite or infinite, that is, whether the universe is Lorentzian or Galilean. Equivalently, all you have to say is whether or not there is an upper limit for the speed of any object. If there is, then you can simply postulate the existence of something that moves with this limiting speed. In other words, to create your universe, you simply have to say, "Let there be light.''

:::That the universe is Lorentzian rather than Galilean is the main point of special relativity. Before 1900 or so, no one even imagined that Lorentzian was possible or could conceive how it would work.

::::I believe the point here is that all these derivations show that symmetry considerations require a certain mathematical form for coordinate transformations, free up to a constant K; the value of K is then determined empirically to be this or that particular power of c. So, in the end, you _do_ need the observation that c is the invariant velocity - but the logical role of this observation is much more limited than before (it removes a degree of freedom from the theory, instead of providing the very basis for the theory). This is very appropriate as a derivation for SR as it emphasizes _relativity_. Also, sure, the const. could be infinite or negative (i seem to recall the negative case leads to some very absurd conclusions), but at some point you just go out, measure it and conclude it's positive&finite - et voila, you have SR.

== Relating to Galilean & Lorentz transformations ==

We have been studying Galilean and Lorentz transformations since a long time and in its derivation, we usually take y- and z-axis as constants, I mean we write  y`= y and z`=z.

:A particle can move in the ''y'' or ''z'' directions as well as in the ''x'' direction, or in a combination of these motions. How the ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates of a particle change over time is not limited by either transformation law. What is meant is &mdash; when the transformation is done, the new ''y'' coordinate associated with an event (a certain occurrence in the life of a particle, for instance) is the same as the old ''y'' coordinate for that event. And similarly, for the ''z'' coordinate. Whereas, the ''x'' coordinate which varies in the direction of the new reference frame's motion vis-a-vis the old reference frame must be re-calculated depending on the time.

==Special Relativity without the Second Postulate==

There are numerous and highly reliable published sources that all agree that special relativity can be derived without Einstein's second postulate. See the short list of 11 references given by Palash B. Pal in the article, [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0302045v1 Nothing but Relativity] for example. 

The abstract to the article [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=AJPIAS000043000005000434000001 Lorentz Transformations from the First Postulate] by A. R. Lee and T. M. Kalotas, published by the American Journal of Physics -- May 1975 -- Volume 43, Issue 5, pp. 434-437, says it best: 

{{cquote|We present in this paper a derivation of the Lorentz transformation by invoking the principle of relativity alone, without resorting to the a priori assumption of the existence of a universal limiting velocity. Such a velocity is shown to be a necessary consequence of the first postulate, and the fact that it is not infinite is borne out by experiment.}}

:: The issue with the second postulate is in what you demand of the "rules of physics" that the first postulate refers to.

:EMS, I've been wondering something.  Isn't there a subtle assumption in these 'one postulate' derivations w.r.t. the synchronization of spatially separated clocks?  And if so, is that not equivalent to the (or maybe 'a') 2nd postulate?  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 20:33, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

:: In the pure "one postulate" derivations, the important thing is the lack of an assumption of synchonization between arbitrary clocks.  Hoewever, my understanding of these derivations is that they leave the limiting speed undefined.  One of the things that the second postulate does is to define the limitng speed.  IMO you really don't have SR until you have set ''c'' as the limiting speed.  Another variation is to say "the rules of physics including those of electromagnetism ..." in the first/only postulate, but IMO that is really a fusion of the two postulates as the PoR does not state which laws of physics are to be treated as fundamental. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 06:19, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:EMS, I agree with you that the "one postulate" derivations leave the limiting (invariant?) speed undefined.  But Einstein, at the outset of his derivation, specified that clocks are synchronized by light signals such that the one way speed of light is always measured to be c.  Now, to my limited understanding, it seems reasonable to believe that the "one postulate" derivations, where the invariant speed is undetermined, must also ''assume'' that ''distant clocks are synchronized by signals traveling at the invariant speed''.  Otherwise, the results of physical experiments, as measured with these clocks, would depend on relative motion.  If this is so, isn't this assumption equivalent to the Einstein's 2nd postulate?

:: I can't speak in such detail about a derivation that I have not carefully studied.  What I can tell you is that these derivations must assume that the spacetime is uniform, isotropic and velocity-invariant, meaning that the properties are the same at all places, in all directions, and as perceived by all inertial observers.  It would therefore follow that if a fininte speed for synchronization signals exists as a matter of spacetime structure, that speed itself would be uniform and isotropic in all reference frames.  At that point, you have the limiting speed due to that consideration alone.
:: Kindly note that the one-postulate derivations '''do not''' get you all the way to SR!  Instead they define a class of theories that at one extreme is classical mechanics (where the limiting speed is infinite) and in another case is SR (where the limiting speed is the [[speed of light]] or ''c'').  So the second postulate becomes the setting of the limiting speed to ''c'' in this class of theories. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 14:43, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:I do understand that the 'one postulate' derivations leave the invariant speed unspecified but I do think that your emphasis of this point is justified given the idea being pushed by other editors here that the 2nd postulate is redundant.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 20:37, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

In the paper referenced above, from glancing at the first page, it looks like the authors essentially ''assume'' a Lorentz spacetime, then ''substitute experimental evidence for the 2nd postulate'' in order to rule out the limiting case of Galilean space for c=infinity.  That hardly reads to me like any invalidation of Einstein's approach---in fact, it boils down to ''starting with'' his revolutionary insight that space and time are related.  Since Newtonian mechanics is invariant in Galilean space(-time), invariance alone can't allow you to "derive" relativity.  Of course, the whole issue of trying to find postulates for deriving relativity seems a little off-point to me.  Einstein's insistence that invariance and constancy of speed of light must be correct led him to ''realize'' that we live in a spacetime described by special relativity. [[User:Gnixon|Gnixon]] 20:53, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:: I think that the real point for our purposes is that the consensus opinion within the scientific community is that two postulates should be used for the derivation of special relativity.  As originally stated by [[Galileo]], the [[principle of relativity]] really does apply to both [[relativity]] and [[Newtonian mechanics]].  It is the second postulate that distinguishes between the two.  People can adopt one postulate. but to work as a single postulate it has to explicitly include Maxwell's equations, light speed constancy, or some other related concept in the postulate itself.  This makes it much more specific than the true principle of relativity is. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:19, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:The 'Nothing but Relativity' [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0302045v1] authors use only the homogeneity and isotropy of space along with the principle of relativity to derive a transformation with an invariant speed that is undetermined.  As EMS has eloquently said, that's as far as you can go with one postulate unless you ''read more into the 1st postulate than there is''.

:There's another paper in the external links [http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0409105] that generalizes the POR further such that there is another degree of freedom in the transformation equations w.r.t. clock synchronization convention.  That's more or less what I was alluding too earlier when I asked EMS if there isn't a hidden assumption in these 'one postulate' derivations.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 23:57, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

::Indeed, EMS had already eloquently covered my basic points.  I apologize for not reading the discussion fully.  I would add, though, that Einstein's real insight wasn't limiting the possible spacetime transformations to special relativity (you can get there from his two postulates or other arguments as already discussed), but rather recognizing that there ''existed'' a transformation between space and time.  The significance of his postulates was that they couldn't both be satisfied without the existence of that transformation.  By the way, my original comment was in response to the first post or two of this discussion, which were the only ones I read carefully.  Not sure if that addresses your post, AC, but I'm glad to discuss further if you like.  [[User:Gnixon|Gnixon]] 00:12, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

I actually don't understand the comment made by EMS and others above that you have to set the limiting speed to c or assume the validity of Maxwell equations to get special relativity. I have two objections to that. First, suppose that the photon turns out to have a mass after all [http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0306245 see e.g. here], then special relativity would still be valid, even though Maxwell's equations are not (at least they would not apply to electromagnetism). Also the limiting velocity would not be the same as the speed of light.

Another objection is that the value of the limiting velocity has no operational meaning because we have yet to define our units. You can always choose your units such that c becomes 1 (unless it is infinite in which case we are dealing with classical mechanics). The term c this a mere rescaling parameter that arises from the fact that we measure time and space in different (from natural) units. This point has been made a few times by Michael Duff, [http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208093 see here] [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0110060 and here]. As Duff explains in the latter article, you could just as well define different (incompatible) units for distances in the x y and z directions. 

E.g. imagine that on the surface of a neutron star there are intelligent creatures that are contrained to move along the surfce. To them the vertical direction is invisible, but it does appear indirectly in their equations of physics. When their Einstein discovers the true laws of physics they get the formula for ds^2 with a c^2 in front of the dt^2 but also a c_{z}^2 in front of the dz^2. Both parametrs would then be dimensionful parameters because they would be associated with concepts from old laws of physics in which these quantities are incompatible.  [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 01:30, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

:I think the point is that you have to decide that there ''exists'' a limiting (finite) speed.  If the photon had a mass, relativity would be correct, and c would be the speed limit, but there just wouldn't be any such thing as the speed of light.  That is, "speed of light" is just a convenient name for the speed limit because light always goes that speed.  Operationally, the speed of light is just the fastest that anything can go---in SI units it's 3E8 m/s, but that speed limit exists and would be physically the same in any units.  This discussion seems to be getting away from the article, and further such discussion should probably at least go to user talk pages.  [[User:Gnixon|Gnixon]] 01:38, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

::All that you can get from the first postulate alone is that the "[[Lorentz factor]]" has the form <math>\gamma = \frac {1} {\sqrt {1 + K \cdot v^2}}</math> for some real number ''K''. If ''K'' is positive, then you get "Euclidean" space-time. If ''K'' is zero, then you get Newtonian space-time. If ''K'' is negative, you get Lorentzian space-time.

:Except that I'm starting to change my mind on the issue, now. After reading [http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0302045v1], already cited, there is a strong argument that one cannot do the entire SR thing from postuate #1 without reading more into it than anybody intended. Afterall, what does it MEAN to say that all laws of physics are the same in all frames? The laws of gas motion correctly predict the speed of sound in air, but that's for a non-moving media, and nobody expects them to predict the same sound speed to be seen by somebody moving into a wind (ie, through the air). The physics is the same, but assumptions have been made about the medium transmitting the vibration. The same happens with Maxwell's derivation of c, which depends on tacit assumption of being at rest with regard to some transmitting medium, which otherwise would set mu and epsilon differently, not as physical law parameters, but as measured properties of the medium, much as you'd measure gas molecule average velocity in air. So the hidden assumption of "all physical laws are the same" is that mu and epsilon are physical constants, independent of motion, and THIS means that there IS no tranmitting medium. Instead, people in different frames have time and length change so that the rato of mu and episilon remains constant. This goes beyond simply saying that the laws of physics are the same, since universal time for all observers (galilean relativity) was assumed as part of physics prior, to all this. So something more is needed as an assertion, to make Maxwell's law's work. That extra thing is the Lorentz transformation which makes Maxwell's laws give "c" for everyone, by jiggering up time and space, in a certain way. Who said it was fair to do that? The guy moving through air and measuring the speed of sound is working with the same laws of physics, but he's not privileged to jigger them up to give a constant speed of sound, no matter how fast he moves. So why are we allowed to jigger up time and space to make only MAXWELL'S laws predictive, dispensing with a medium for light, but not other waves of other kinds? You see the problem. Something more is needed. Some statement warning that Maxwell's equations are sacrosanct and don't have to be adjusted for medium-motion (rather you change their time and space inputs), but OTHER physical laws describing waves in other media at slower speeds (like sound), are to be adjusted differently.

On the second postulate/axiom Dr. Rindler writes "The acceptance of the relativity principle - Einstein's first axiom - seems harmless enough until we come to his second axiom: ..." which is followed by a formal description of the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum.
:::* {{cite book|title=Gravitation and Relativity|last=Bowler|first=M.G.|year=1976|id={{ISBN|0-08-020408-2}}}} - "If we accept that the equations of electromagnetism are true for all observersin inertial frames and Lorentz covariant, the we must either discard the relativity principle or the equations of particle mechanics must also be Lorentz covariant."  (Lorentz covariance refers to being subject to the [[Lorentz transformations]], the equations underlying SR.)  This indicates that one has a choice of whether to accept that the equations of EM are true in all inertial frames or not.  It is only after one has chosen to accept Maxwell's equations as laws of nature that the relativity principle demands SR.

I think that there is some hidden historical bias in this discussion (Ohanian also mentions this bias in his book). If you think about it, it is very unnatural from a theoretical physics point of view to start with Maxwell equations (which are already covariant under Lorentz transformations) and then try to derive relativity theory. Only because students know about Maxwell equation before they learn relativity do we teach it in this way.

That's a nice-looking graphic for the light cone, but the caption beneath it doesn't sound right. It says:

"The lower quarter of the diagram shows the events that are visible to the observer, and the upper quarter shows the light cone- those that will be able to see the observer."

The light cone consists of both the lower and upper quarters, no? Also, visibility to an observer is along the past light cone's surface. Visibility of an observer is along the future light cone's surface. So, shouldn't the passage say something like this?:

"The lower quarter of the diagram shows the observer's past light cone -- events that can affect the observer -- and the upper quarter shows the observer's future light cone -- events that the observer can affect."

::: Re-introduced the section, but changed the notation to make it consistent with its supersection. [[User:DVdm|DVdm]] 12:57, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

(reset indent) The problem with this caveat is that it does not use the definition of a reference frame as a collection of comoving observers each with their own synchronised clock.

In a given frame of reference clocks are synchronised, they dont just give the same intervals, they give the same absolute readings. 

In a given frame intervals can be determined within AND between clocks:

If DT(1) = D12 - D11

and DT(2) = D22 - D21

Then DT= D12 - D21

and DT=DT(1)=DT(2)

So why does the Lorentz transformation contain the phase term vx/c^2?  If an observer in a relatively moving frame reports that DT=DT(1)=DT(2) why does an observer in another frame disagree?

The reason for this is that the Lorentz Transformation compares the absolute time in one frame with that in another for a '''single observer'''. The use of synchronised clocks at different positions in the moving frame will be perplexing to the stationary observer because it will appear to him as if '''they have all been artificially set out of sync by the amount of the phase term'''.  Only the two clocks that are coincident with the origin at t=0 will be initially synchronised between frames. All the other clocks that are in the frame that is moving relatively to the frame where the length measurement is being made will be conveniently out of phase by the amount of the phase term for the separation of the clocks.

So, taking two clocks separated by L metres, the clocks will appear out of sync due to the LT by g vL /c^2 but will have been conveniently synchronised at the outset to have an absolute time difference of minus gvL/c^2.

Given this, how can we measure the length of a rod? Suppose we place a mirror at one end and time how long light takes to go to the end and back:

DX = cDT (where T is half the overall time interval)

This works because the rod, the timing device and the mirror are in the same frame of reference. Only the light moves, v is 0 so g is 1 and vx/c^2 is 0.

We can do the same thing for a moving rod in its comoving reference frame:

Dx= cDt

But can we do it BETWEEN frames? Can we measure the length of a rod that is stationary in one frame from another, moving frame?

The definition of a reference frame is a collection of comoving observers each with their own synchronised clock. All we need to do is observe the reading on the clock that is adjacent to front end of the rod when the light is emitted and then read the clock that is adjacent to the front end of the rod when the reflected light returns.

We can then use Dx=cDt to determine the length of the rod as measured from the moving frame.

Clearly then x/t = X/T can be used to compare the two lengths and t and T can be related by the time dilation formula, contrary to the caveat.

The caveat, based on the LT for a single observer, does not take into account the synchronisation procedure between clocks in an inertial frame of reference. Incidently, the derivation of length contraction from time dilation is the standard method:

:: Dt' = g ( Dt - v Dx )   [eq1]

Please keep in mind that people skim articles like this, and a mention of something which is '''in'''valid sometimes gets mistaken for something valid because it is present in the article.  So its being present here could actually do more to put that idea into people's minds than to keep in from being considered.
:: This also would not be the first time that something of questionable usefulness sat in an article for a while before being reconsidered by a new crop of editors.  Wikipedia will always be a work in progress, and it is not unreasonable that statements which were or appeared to be acceptable at one time could later be found to be unacceptable as policies, available information, and other circumstances change.  This may well be one of those times. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 21:14, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

::: Yes, you make a ''very good point'' about people possibly skimming the article and erroneously picking up an invalid concept. The way the caveat is formulated now has become much too explicit. If you (unlike others) at least agree that the point I make is a perfectly valid one, I propose to edit it in a way that is much more concise and less prone to superficial misinterpretation. This really being a caveat for 'beginners' and therefore i.m.o. belonging in the introduction, I am not tempted to put it in there anymore, since I don't think that the introduction article is an article for beginners anyway.
::: So I propose to remove the subsection, and just insert a much shorter sentence immediately behind the phrase ''This phenomenon is called length contraction or Lorentz contraction'':
:::: '''Caveat''': One might be tempted to combine the above two equations into something like '''<math>\Delta x' \Delta t' = \Delta x \Delta t</math>''' or '''<math>\Delta x' / \Delta t' = \Delta x / \Delta t / \gamma^2</math>''', but as can be seen from the conditions imposed on the events by the equations, namely '''<math>\Delta x = 0</math>''' for time dilation, and '''<math>\Delta t' = 0</math>''' for length contraction, combining the equations ''for one pair of events'' can only be valid in the trivial case where all the deltas trivially reduce to zero: '''<math>\Delta x = \Delta t = \Delta x' = \Delta t' = 0</math>''', in other words for two identical events.
::: Come to think of it... up to that sentence the section [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity#Time_dilation_and_length_contraction|''Time dilation and length contraction''] was written by myself :-)

:::: That will work much, much better if this business is to be kept at all.  I do like it BTW - It is short and sweet and gets to the point long before one's mind starts to wander.  Also the bolding of "caveat" gives it the proper red flag treatment.

::::: Actually, the argument in the caveat against the definition of an invariant area is incorrect. the area is really an invariant. And if you multiply this area bt Dy and Dz you get an invariant volume Dt*Dx*Dy*Dz=Dt`*Dx`*Dy`*Dz`. The way to show that is not to chose specific cases where Dt=0 or Dx=0. You would have to multiply the volume Dt*Dx*Dy*Dz by the determinat of the Jacobian matrix (simply called the Jacobian) of the coordinate transformatio. Since this transformation is linear, the Jacobian matrix is the transformation matrix itself, which has unit determinant. QED [[User:Dauto|Dauto]] 04:38, 28 April 2007 (UTC).

EMS, that leaves us with the page [[Introduction to special relativity]] that has been almost completely rewritten by someone who thinks that the time dilation equation Dt' = g Dt can be valid for a pair of events that do not satisfy Dx = 0, in other words for a clock at rest in the (x,t)-frame that produces ticks at different places.

EMS: "''...trivial issue out of the USENET...''": => Not only USENET. Perhaps even more so on the Web, and Wikipedia is part of the Web as well, isn't it? ;-)

EMS: "''...fighting strawman by anti-relativists...''": => I don't really see this as a fight with anti-relativists. Just a warning that might help beginners to avoid becoming anti-relativists by failing to understand the, to beginners, de-facto most well known equations of special relativity. I notice that failing to ''understand them in their proper context'' is extremely, almost frighteningly widespread, both among beginning amateurs as among, yes, professional physicists. That is the reason why I carefully worded the section [[Time dilation and length contraction]] in its current form. I really think the caveat belongs in there.

EMS: "''...an editor who suggested that it be placed here. So DVdm did just that...''": => Correction: it was moved here by that editor, who, simply failing to understand it, decided that it is ''too complex'' for an introduction to special relativity :-)

Good grief, what a fuzz over such a ''trivial issue''. Such a simple statement, but apparently some of the contributors here are even simpler. Yet for some of the more sophisticated contributors, the statement seems to be too sophisticated. A paradox.

Well, since I stand by it, I really think it should be inserted again. To those who find themselves somewhere between the extremes of simplicity and over-sophistication, feel free to contribute. [[User:DVdm|DVdm]] 09:39, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:Let me try explaining that again. I removed the caveat from that article because it was factually incorrect. It stated that it is not possible to define an invariant area in the space-time diagram. As a pointed out through a simple jacobian argument, an area in these diagrams is indeed an invariant. As an answer, I was told that we are supposed to be talking about only two points in the space-time diagrams, and that in such case, either Dt or Dx would be zero giving an zero area.
:To that I say "Duuhh..." Of course that`s the area you should get, because that`s the area contained inside a closed polynonal lin with only to vrtices. With 3 (or more) points in the space-time diagram, though, it is possible to define a polygon that encloses a non-vanishing area. That area will indeed be an invariant. That`s why I think this caveat should be kept out of the article [[User:Dauto|Dauto]] 16:58, 29 April 2007 (UTC).

You keep asking me how to define an invariant area '''for two arbitrary events'''. I think I made it clear that the '''two events''' restriction is unreasonable because a polygon with two vertices will always have vanishing area. If you really feel the need to include this silly caveat, it should be about the need to add a third event in order to properly define an invariant area. It shouldn`t say that it is not possible to define an invariant are, though, because that would be factually incorrect.

[[User:Dauto|Dauto]] 18:41, 29 April 2007 (UTC).

:::: I added my comment at the place where it belonged. If you start making a point with a false premise ("''either Dt or Dx would be zero''"), it doesn't make sense to continue reading. Of course I meant "''both'' Dt ''and'' Dx". The fact that you hadn't noticed that, although it was explicitly stated with the set of equations Dx = Dt = Dx' = Dt' = 0, shows that you hadn't really carefully looked at the statement, so I cut it short at that particular point. I notice that you don't like that, so I will put everyting below your lines now. Sorry.

== Time Dilation and Length Contraction ==

Edit concerning the Special relativity page: The dilation and contraction formulas are incorrect. If moving clocks run slower (which they do), then an observer in the chosen rest frame will read a time t on his watch, and the slower time t* on the watch in the moving system. So t* < t as observed in the rest frame. Certainly gamma is greater than 1, so it must be that γt* = t, in order to correct for the time discrepancy.

Similarly, moving objects appear shorter. So if the observer in the rest frame observes a length L for a rod in the moving frame, then L* > L, if L* is the length of the rod in the moving frame. So it must be that L* = γL to correct for the length discrepancy.

I don't know how this error came to light, my guess is that the argument used is incorrect. Please correct me with a logically sound argument if I'm wrong. I also have a text by my side by physicist David J. Griffiths confirming my stand on the issue. If I am correct, then please change it.<br/>
P.S. Sorry for all the edits, I just kept thinking of clearer ways to phrase my argument.
[[User:Woojamon|Woojamon]] 00:49, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:Please re-read the description in this section again.  The clock is ''at rest'' in the ''unprimed'' system.  The observer is in the ''primed'' system which is in relative motion w.r.t the ''unprimed'' system.  The change in time (delta t) in the ''unprimed'' system, ''as observed from the primed system'', must be smaller that than the change in time (delta t') in the primed system ''as observed from the primed system''.

:The observer is, by definition, at rest in his frame.  As the observer is at rest in the primed frame, the primed time is the time of the observer.  To say that the observer is moving w.r.t. the unprimed frame does not imply that the observer's clock runs slower than the unprimed frame.

== 1905? ==

The special theory of relativity was proposed in 1905 by Albert Einstein in his article "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies". 

Please note that Einstein did not, in fact, live or was conceived in 1905.

[[User:Zeroxy|Zeroxy]] 04:26, 17 May 2007 (UTC)
:Actually, Einstein was born in 1879 and was 26 years old in 1905 when relativity theory was published.

This introduction is misleading and technically incorrect for a purist. The 1905 paper is not special relativity in the sense we know it but a larger theory which introduced the special relativity theory as an introductory kinematical theory prepatory to the electrodynamics theory. The term "Theory of Relativity" is first used by Einstein only in his 1911 paper in which it is made clear that this term applies to the kinematical part of his 1905 theory. So what we call special relativity is really a subset of the entire theory. But common usage has come to apply this term to the kinematical and the electrodynamical parts of Einstein's theory. 

Many people fail to realise that Einstein's theory is not contained in the 1905 paper alone, and thus fail to read his other papers of 1907 (this is really the most important one of all, more so than the 1905 paper), and the papers of 1910 and 1911, which discuss the relationship of the theory to the problem of the ether in greater detail. All of them should be read as well as the 1912 unpublished version which has only recently been published. The reader is urged to consult Einstein's Papers, a set of books which contains these papers as well as those on general relativity and other interesting bits of information.

== Confusion. Help needed ==

I am confused a bit by relativity so I have a question. It stems from a lot of things, most  noteably a film I saw on YouTube, of all  places! It explains Special Relativity by giving an example of a moving train, which from the stationary observer's point of view was hit by lightning simultaneously and from the observer in the train the train was struck first of all by the one in the front and then the one on the back - but isn't that merely an optical illusion? I shall explain my reasoning. The stationary observer will have seen the truth of the matter as the light at the front would have less distance to travel by the pace the train was travelling at would fool the moving observer.fleebfleeb

==Mass-energy equivalence bullet==
New text, improving on the apple example to show that mass is indeed convertible to energy:

'''Equivalence of [[mass]] and [[energy]], [[mass-energy equivalence|''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''²]]''' — mass can be converted to energy<!-- Comment by Edgerck: Mass to energy conversion IS a violation of classical (Newtonian) energy conservation. Not every energy can be converted to mass; see L.B.Okun, The Relations of Particles, ISBN 981020454X; there is not a complete equivalence between mass and energy, which does not need to be expanded on here. -->. In particular, the mass of two apples together is ''less'' than the mass of each isolated (free) apple, the mass difference being the energy that is released when the apples are brought together, divided by the speed of light squared.

Just take two systems of hard spheres one with total energy E1 and the other with total energy E2. Let them exchange energy by exchanging spheres. If the total number of spheres in each system doesn't change but the total energy in each system does change, then the mass of each system does change.

::Count Iblis is essentially correct. If anyone is out of the mainstream of physics here, he is Edgerck. The momentum four-vector (including energy) is proportional to the velocity four-vector. Mass is just the proportionality "constant". If we eliminate the constant from the equations, we get <math>\vec{p} c^2 = E \vec{v}.</math> Energy should be defined in such a way that it is conserved. This requires that it include the energy due to rest mass as well as kinetic energy. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 04:21, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

"Conservation of energy implies that in any reaction a decrease of the sum of the masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic and potential energies of the particles after the reaction." was introduced by Ems57fcva and is in direct contradiction to "the mass of two apples together is ''less'' than the mass of each isolated (free) apple, the mass difference being the energy that is released when the apples are brought together, divided by the speed of light squared." -- which is correct. The last phrase after this one, inserted by the same user, is also not correct. Editor Ems57fcva should revert or declare a dispute since this item was already in discussion here.

If the apple example above does not appeal to some editor's appetite, I suggest replacing it by: "The mass of a helium nucleus (that has two protons and two neutrons) is somewhat less than two times the proton mass plus two times the mass of a neutron." This phrase, which also contradicts the current version, is supported in mainstream literature, including Kenneth R. Lang, Astrophysical Formulae, Springer (1999), {{ISBN|3540296921}}

I hope this is useful. [[User:Edgerck|Edgerck]] 09:58, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:I don't see a contradiction. The reason that the mass of a helium nucleus is less than that of the individual particles is because, after you bring two protons and two neutrons together, they emit energy (I guess in the form of gamma radiation). See [[Binding energy#Mass defect]].
:The sentence "Ems57fcva should revert or declare a dispute" implies a rule which I have never seen here, so that rule probably does not exist. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 10:24, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:Hmmm, I have to admit that I'm no longer very sure about it. But I think the energy balance is as follows. When bringing the separate neucleons together in a bound nucleus, we get a decrease in potential energy and a decrease in mass; these are balanced by an energy increase carried away by the  gamma radiation. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 10:42, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

Jitse: The rule is that the person doing the reversal #3 (CI in this case) should NOT, and the reversal #3 should be reverted. Ems57fcva knows this rule, and mistakenly (in good faith, I believe) warned me about the reversal #3, and then changed himself to what he wanted without discussion here.

The contradiction is that the "decrease of the sum of the masses of particles" is NOT "accompanied by an increase in kinetic and potential energies of the particles after the reaction." After the reaction, the energy corresponding to the mass defect was released as radiation and is not present in the kinetic and potential energies of the particles.

Hope this is useful. [[User:Edgerck|Edgerck]] 10:50, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:But the usual way of writing down such reactions is by including the photons (if there are any). An kinetic energy is, by definition, the energy minus the rest mass (times c^2, but I always use units such that c = 1). So, there is nothing wrong even if "the energy is carried away by radiation". Also, the energy doesn't need to be carried away by radiation at all. Consider e.g. a collision between two protons yielding three protons and an anti-proton. Sum of rest masses are not equal on both sides. Kinetic energy is (partially) converted to "rest mass energy", total energy is conserved.  [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 14:21, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:The reason I changed the text was because it suggested that the total energy can change.

I kindly remark that the text did not suggest that the total energy can change. In fact, this is the article bullet text that you reversed (btw, I think you reversed my texts more than 3x in 24h, but who is counting?)

'''Equivalence of [[mass]] and [[energy]], [[mass-energy equivalence|''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''²]]''' — mass can be converted to energy. In particular, the mass of two apples together is ''less'' than the mass of each isolated (free) apple, the mass difference being the energy that is released when the apples are brought together, divided by the speed of light squared.

I see no reason to change it. The text uses E=mc<sup>2</sup>and specifically talks about the mass difference and its energy equivalence to keep total energy constant, to wit: (mass before - mass after)c<sup>2</sup> =  energy released. The text also does not needlessly repeat the formula in words (what's the point?). Please (you or EMS, it's just the same for me), revert to the text that I had worked on before. Thanks!

: About the apples, you need to mention the gravitational potential energy for clarity. But this two apple system, for which the mass is indeed less than the sum of the masses of the individual apples, is a bad example. The effect is so small that it is swamped by other effects. E.g. a tiny charge on the apples would undo this effect. You can't put the apples on top of each other, because then the elastic deformation energy of the bottom apple is much larger than the mutual gravitational energy....

== Section on 'comoving' ==

In the sentence ''Since there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory, a concept of 'moving' doesn't strictly exist, as everything is always moving with respect to some other reference frame.'', should '''concept of 'moving'''' be '''concept of 'stationary''''?  I'm no expert in this field but it felt like it read incorrectly.  I say this because you then introduce the concept of 'comoving' which seems to replace 'stationary' with a more accurate term, rather than 'moving'.

What was meant is the mutual potential energy of unbound particles or potential energy of the particles in an external field. The mutual potential energy of two particles contributes to the (invariant)mass of the two particle system, not to the mass of the individual particles. 

::No. According to NPOV refs. and the energy-momentum equation (E² = m² + p²), the sentence "The mutual potential energy of two particles contributes to the (invariant)mass of the two particle system" is better left unsaid. [[User:Edgerck|Edgerck]] 17:01, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

::::: I`ll have to come in edgerck`s defense here. he`s got a point when he says that rest mass is an invariant (AKA 4-space scalar) while Energy is the time-like component of a 4-vector. these are two different kinds of objects. But some authors choose to use the word mass to mean the relativistic mass, and that mass is not an invariant. It can be obtained from the energy by use of the famous formula: E=mc^2. So, at the end,  it all comes to a matter of semantics. What do we mean by mass? do we mean the rest mass? if so, then edgerck is right. do we mean the relativistic mass? if so, then he is wrong. The real question here then is: what do we choose to mean by th word mass? I vote on edgerck`s side just because it seems wastefull to me to reserve the word mass to mean something as redundant as the relativistic mass (After all that`s just the energy times a constant that I usually set to 1 anyways...)

:::::: You miss the point. Ed claims that since an atom loses mass after emitting a massless photon, that '''mass''' is not conserved in SR. Thus, he's wrong no matter WHAT definition of mass is used. In fact, system mass is conserved for any given single observer (single frame) during such a reaction in a closed system, whether the system "mass" spoken of, is the relativistic or invariant sort. The difference is that the system mass is an additive property of the individual system component masses if we use relativistic mass (even the photon has a mass, there), but it isn't, if we use invariant mass (the closest we get is that in one special frame, the COM frame, system mass is the root-of-sum-of-squares of individual masses). But that's a sort of geometric sum, not an ordinary algebraic sum. <p> In any case, most physicists prefer to give up mass additivity in systems when they already have energy and momentum additivity, in order to define system "mass" as something which is not only conserved in closed systems for single frames (like energy and momentum) but also is Lorentz invariant for systems and across reactions (unlike energy and momentum), and thus is the same in any frame.[[User:Sbharris|<font color="blue">S</font>]][[User:Sbharris|<font color="orange">B</font>]][[User:Sbharris|H]][[User:Sbharris|arris]] 02:10, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps we are focusing too much on the meaning of "mass" here. I think the real disagreement is over "converted". Since I and (I think) most readers will understand "converted" to mean something like &mdash; breaking a table into its component pieces of wood and building two chairs with them is converting a table into two chairs. Mass is definitely ''not'' converted to energy in that sense regardless of how you define mass. However, one could say, for example, that the energy of rest mass is converted to the energy of radiation in certain reactions. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 05:34, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

::''Convert: change the nature, purpose, or function of something; "convert lead into gold"; "convert hotels into jails"; "convert slaves to laborers"''. So, "convert mass to energy" is fitting to the definition, and is also widely used in physics in the same use (see refs. given), even though crank websites that I cited elsewhere insist otherwise. Mass and energy are ''not'' two forms of the same thing (notwithstanding what WP says today), which also makes "convert" the correct word to use.

:::Mass is defined in terms of energy (i.e. the total energy of the system in the zero momentum frame)and it is therefore just energy.

Then the alpha emerges at .04 c; the neutron at .17 c. In the (D,T) reaction, mass is not accurately conserved, and (nonrelativistic) kinetic energy has been produced from scratch, even though no particle is moving at a speed very close to the speed of light. Relativistic energy is conserved, of course, but there is no useful way to divide it up into two pieces that are separately conserved. In thought experiments, by adjusting the masses, we could make this problem appear in situations where the motion is arbitrarily slow.

:::The sentence: "There is no separate principle of mass conservation" means that conservation of (invariant) mass is not separate from conservation of energy and momentum. Wilczek writes: "Suppose that the deuterium and tritium are initially at rest" So, we are in the zero momentum frame. He also writes: "Relativistic energy is conserved, of course," And of course momentum is also conserved. That means that the total momentum of the alpha plus neutron is still zero and that thebtotal energy of that system is the same as it was before. So, the invariant mass is the same. However, it is the case that "The total mass of the deuterium plus tritium exceeds that of the alpha plus neutron by 17.6 MeV".

:::Mass in the meaning Wilczek is contemplating is definitely '''not''' invariant mass of system of particles. The sentence "sum of the masses" he uses makes that very clear. You say that "Mass and invariant mass are synonymous". That's indeed the case, but you do have to define for which system you take the invariant mass. Wilczek consideres the single particle invariant masses. He takes the total mass to be the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles. Now that quantity is not conserved. But the invariant mass of the entire system '''is''' conserved, however that may not be a quantity of interest. You cannot split this quantity up and assign each particle part of this quantity so that the invariant mass of the total system becomes the sum of these quantities.

::::Correct. Nobody claimed that invariant masses are additive in systems to give a system total invariant mass. System m is not equal to m1+m2, and yet there is a well defined m. Moreover, when m1 and m2 change in a reaction, so long as the system is closed, the system mass calculated by vector sums (not simple arithmetic sums) is still m, which is same as the old system m. That's the magic. Invariance is not equal to subcomponent additivity. These are vectors. As I keep trying to tell Ed, to get the length of two added vectors you can't just add the lengths of the vectors, since they may not be pointed in the same direction. To add them, you have to add their components, THEN calculate the length of the total final vector. This is what is invariant, this length. Nobody ever claimed it was made of the lengths of the vectors which compose it. <p> And I have to add that I think Wilczek is wrong that "There is no separate principle of mass conservation." There certainly is if you define mass as invariant mass. But he's right (and nobody ever argued otherwise) that system mass is not generally the simple direct sum of masses of subcomponents, if you define system mass (and subcomponent mass) in this way.

If you're talking about "what goes in" to the reaction, and "what goes out" of the reaction, that's fine so long as none of it interacts with the environment or crosses the imaginary boundary line (which we can draw anywhere we like, so long as we don't change it) then that's fine.[[User:Sbharris|<font color="blue">S</font>]][[User:Sbharris|<font color="orange">B</font>]][[User:Sbharris|H]][[User:Sbharris|arris]] 18:19, 12 June 2007 (UTC)
::In between, the system evolves without any interaction (in or out) with the environment. Of course, this is an abstraction (as no system is truly isolated), but is useful in theoretical and even experimental (negligible influence) considerations. So, the statement in Physics Today that "In general, it is simply not true that the sum of the masses of what goes in is the same as the sum of the masses of what goes out." shows that the opposite statement found in WP today (that mass is conserved in SR) is simply not supported by [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:Verifiability]] references.

:::No. Ed, can't you understand that the total system mass is NOT the "sum of the masses?"  The total system mass is what is conserved. However, the sum of the masses is NOT conserved in reactions (in general, though it may be in a few particular cases). '''''Nobody''''' here, ever said it was. Nor is the sum of system masses equal to the total system mass, usually. Nobody here said it was. None of this changes the fact that TOTAL system mass is invariant and conserved.

== A question of relevance: E<sup>2</sup>=m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>+p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> ==

This is a long question which I'm going to put forward as a hypothesis.

When calculating the total energy of a moving object, physicists use the equation E<sup>2</sup>=m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>+p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>.

E is the total energy
m is the rest mass
p is the relativistic momentum
c is the speed of light. 

This equation suggests that an object will gain energy as its relative speed increases. 

p is defined as γmv where γ is the relativistic element called the Lorentz factor, defined to be 1/the square root of 1-v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>, v is the relative velocity to the observer. This means that as v approaches the value of c, γ will approach infinity. This takes the total energy towards infinity.

The implication of this equation is that if a massive object is near a relative speed of c, an impact with an object in the same inertial frame as the observer could potentially release nearly an infinite amount of energy. Equally, to accelerate an object to c would take an infinite amount of energy. 

This is an argument as to why this may not be the case.

An object moving relative to the observer will be observed to have slower processes in accordance with the special theory of relativity. Time, and thus an objects ability to express energy, appears to slow down within any moving object. This means that if we accelerate an object at a steady rate (according to the observer), the acceleration within the observed object will be experienced as a steadily increasing rate of acceleration. 

For example, if the steady acceleration is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> to the outside observer, once time appears to be running at 1 second inside the observed object for every 100 seconds for the observer, those within the observed object will experience the acceleration at 980 m/s<sup>2</sup>. As the observer attempts to accelerate the object to a relative speed of c, the acceleration experienced inside the observed object will be nearly instantaneous.

This is why circular particle accelerators take so much power. As objects approach very high relative speeds, any acceleration is going to take more energy because we are effectively increasing the acceleration. However, I must wonder whether the view that an object is increasing its mass is the most accurate way of viewing this event.

So what about the first law of thermodynamics? Regardless of what is going on within the observed object (the normality within) we, the observers, are pouring in enormous amounts of energy to accelerate even the tiniest particles to a large fraction of c. What work is possibly being accomplished? Where is the energy going?

My suggestion is the work being done is changing the inertial frame. The power necessary to actually change the rate of all the internal process of every single particle of a massive object is enormous. But this is exactly what the general theory of relativity suggests we are doing every time we change the inertial frame of any massive object.

It is not unlike raising an object within a gravity field (putting something on a hill). It is an act of turning kinetic energy into potential energy.

For example, if an atomic bomb was detonated while passing an observer at near the speed of light, its internal processes would be experienced at a very different rate to that of the observer. (Note to physicists: I realise that only a fraction of the bomb’s mass is converted to energy (Per the physicist’s comment on my blog entry (http://emergenceofus.blogspot.com/2007/07/relative-energy-limits-when-appearances.html), though I don’t understand why this is necessary to stress.) Most likely, the observer will experience a mild increase in heat, no dangerous levels radioactivity and certainly no shock waves (from the explosion). This reason for this is time has slowed down so much that the maximum rate of energy release will be drastically slowed.

This is not unlike hibernation in complex animals: the energy expenditure is minimised through the slowing of internal processes.

At the extreme, an object travelling at a relative speed of c can release no energy from within because no processes can be observed within an object travelling at c. This is not unlike the concept of cryogenic freezing: no energy or change is expressed or experienced.

But what happens if we were to decelerate the detonating bomb into the same inertial frame as the observer?

As the bomb approaches the same inertial frame as the observer, the more quickly the internal process will appear to cycle. Energy can be released at a much greater rate. As such the explosion becomes more “noticeable”. 

Note that the full extent of the proper energy, E=mc², can only be fully experienced by the observer when the bomb and the observer are within the same inertial frame.

So, what happens if our detonating atomic bomb is accelerated from c into the same inertial frame as an observer?

The act of accelerating the bomb into the inertial frame of the observer will bring into play the principles of the general theory of relativity. Acceleration of any sort slows “time”, or the internal processes. This means that the internal processes of our bomb are once again slowed relative to the observer and the full power of E= mc² is diminished. On the other hand, the potential energy from decelerating the object into our inertial frame can be realised as kinetic energy.

At rest, a massive object has a maximum energy potential of mc<sup>2</sup>. But as soon as mass is in motion relative to an observer, the energy derived from this part of the equation must be decreased even as the potential energy from the change in inertial frame adds to the total energy.

According the equation E<sup>2</sup>=m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>+p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>, as an object approaches the speed of light, the energy contained within will approach infinity. So even if the rest mass energy is effectively reduced to zero, as an object approaches c the energy potential of the momentum (p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>) will approach infinity. If v ever equals c, the denominator goes to zero. The quotient dictates infinite energy.

But the problem is that the slower internal process of any massive object will also affect what is now considered momentum energy, especially as the rest mass m is once again included in this part of the equation. (p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>  where p=γmv) 

None of this is reflected in the current equation.

This energy can only be experienced by capturing the relative speed and converting it into energy. Once again, general relativity tells us that any massive object experiencing the forces of acceleration will slow the internal processes. Therefore, the maximum amount of potential energy contained within the momentum of any mass is reduced.

One physicist (see comments on previous blog entry) felt the need to distinguish the kinetic state of an object verse the actual energy that can be experienced in reality by an observer. I cautiously suggest that a theoretical energy state that cannot be experienced in reality is not really part of reality. It is possible that the faultless math is taking us to something similar to the ultra violet catastrophe.

In reality, we lose energy in the very act of trying to access it. The only question is: will the energy loss exceed the gain predicted by an equation that suggests infinite energy?

The most violent collision possible for anyone to observe within our universe is two objects colliding head-on at just under the speed of light. For the purposes of examining the extremes, let’s just assume the two objects are both travelling at exactly c relative to an observer.

It will seem to the observer that no time is passing within either moving object. As such, there is no rest mass energy available. Even infinite mass will yield no energy because no processes can be expressed. However, the moment we begin the deceleration process, not only do we gain some energy from the mass, we can begin to access the enormous energy contained in the inertial frames. But the more we access the potential energy, the more we the forces of acceleration act upon the internal processes of the object, robbing it of its full proper energy potential (E= mc²). The general theory of relativity tells us that the processes needed to express the energy are being slowed which reduces the amount of energy that can be expressed at any given moment.

A collision between two equally massive objects will bring both of them into the inertial frame of the observer nearly instantly. There would be so much going on within such a collision that the math would be incredibly convoluted. 

However, consider the extreme: if both colliding objects were converted totally into energy by the collision, what would the result be? I would suggest that the maximum amount of energy released in such an collision would be E=(m<sub>object1</sub>+m<sub>object2</sub>)c<sup>2</sup>.

My suggestion is that mc<sup>2</sup> is the maximum amount of energy that can be expressed in our universe by any massive object regardless of its inertial frame. 

Thus:

Postulate 1:  	Energy must be inside the same inertial frame as the observer before it becomes relevant.
Postulate 2: 	E=mc² is a universal energy maximum for any given amount of mass, regardless of its 			inertial frame of reference and its associated momentum.
Thus

m<sub>rest</sub>c<sup>2</sup> – m<sub>motion</sub>c<sup>2</sup> = p (easily testable with the right equipment)

I would want to change p to the potential energy stored in the new inertial frame (or perhaps this is the same as momentum).

It could be that the act of creating relative movement is simply an act of translating proper energy into a potential energy in the form of a different inertial frame. The system as a whole neither gains nor loses energy. The energy expended to create acceleration is spent by doing the work of slowing the processes down within the system. That is why the special theory of relativity is only relevant to observed objects. Regardless of how an object may appear to an observer (nearly infinite mass, no time, no length) the experience within that object is one of normality.

So, my question is: why do you think I'm wrong?

Thank you very much for looking at this.

Interesting.  I think this is worth mentioning in the article, since most people will think that something new has been discovered.  [[User:Timb66|Timb66]] 12:59, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I understand why one would want to include it. I see a few problems though, which have to do with how wikipedia is supposed to work. In case of this and other "latest news" reported in the media, we know that newspapers are not so reliable sources.

In case of this news item I read some news stories that are completely wrong. We can deal with that by citing the preprint, [http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0681 see here]. However, if you read this preprint, you'll see that what they've measured is not generally considered to be a violation of special relativity. If we want to include this properly in wikipedia, we would have to violate slightly the rules for original research.

This is why many wiki editors from wikiproject physics do not like to include "the latest news" in wikipedia by citing such preprints. Now, I'm far more liberal than most other editors from wikiproject physics. I don't really mind including it, but then we should focus on the actual physics that is reported in the preprint. We can justify doing this and violating slightly the wiki rules for original research, because many editors here are experts in physics.

As long as we don't say that: "we can't analyze this paper because that would be original research" and then just include the information from newspapers even if that contradicts what's been reported in the preprint, I'm fine.  [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 13:58, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

New findings are often hyped by their discoverers to gain attention and funding for more research.  Furthermore, news sources will often pile on with the hype into order to sell more product.  "Special relativity violated" is a much more grabbing headine than "Odd QM effect reported that may violate special relativity".  So my advice is to take this with a grain of salt and see if it even makes it into a decent journal and also what it says if and when it is published in a serious journal. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:03, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== Mass energy equivalence ==

This means that a mass of m contains an amount of energy of m c^2. Mass is never converted to energy as that would imply a violation of conservation of energy. Although one can say that energy in one form is converted to energy of another form. Also note that there exist no such thing as "Newtonian energy". How is that defined? Can you do an experiment that distinguishes "Newtonian Energy" from anothr type of energy?  Of course not!  [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 17:56, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

:CI: You want to change a simple entry for mass-energy equivalence to a long statement including : ''any mass contains an amount of internal energy equal to <math>m c^{2}</math>. Conservation of energy implies that in any reaction a decrease of the sum of the masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic and potential energies of the particles after the reaction''. This second part of this statement is not only off topic for the entry, but is false. Two different isolated systems, with the same energy, can have different inertial masses -- this is mainstream physics. See, for example,  Edwin Floriman Taylor, John Archibald Wheeler, Spacetime Physics: introduction to special relativity, W.H.Freeman & Co Ltd (1992), {{ISBN|0716723271}}.

:This is the statement that should be used instead: ''any mass can be converted to energy''. This statement is in accordance with mainstream physics. 

:BTW, I know that [[http://www.circlon-theory.com/HTML/EmcFallacies.html|E=MC2 Fallacies and the Non-Conversion of Mass to Energy]] and other crank sites disagree, but any mass can be converted to energy (the reverse is not always true).

Edgerck, your comments are irrelevant as we are talking about the "rest" mass here. Your version of the article suggest that energy is not conserved.

:: The other items in the list also have clarifications, so why not this one? Many people don't understand the meaning of E = m c^2, they think that it says that mass can be converted into energy where "conversion" is meant in the literal sense, i.e. they wrongly think that you have a decrease in mass and an increase in energy. We need to emphasize that total energy is conserved. This can be done by giving an example of a reaction involving particles in which the sum of the masses of the particles changes.

:2. Contrary to what you say above, it's simply true (see the references I gave above!) that mass can be converted into energy where "conversion" is meant in the literal sense, i.e. physicists correctly  think that you can have a decrease in mass and an increase in energy.

::2 That's just nonsense. Conservation of energy is rigorously true in physics. Do you have a reference that says that energy is not conserved? I don't think so! You are simply misinterpreting what Okun is saying. I also note that Okun has a certain number of views that are not held by most other physicists, in particular about a fundamental distinction between mass and energy, and between length and time. [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 02:00, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

:: If you do calculations like finding the recoil energy of the atom after the photon is emitted you write down conservation of four-momentum. Have you ever done such calculations (you must have since you have studied physics)? So, what you mean by mass being converted to energy is simply the fact that the atom after the photon is emitted has a lower rest mass that can be related to the energy of the photon. But the total energy of atom plus photon is exactly the same as the energy of the excited atom (because binding energies are not the same). 


::3 Irrelevant nonsense. Yes, that may be crack stuff, but conservation of energy is NOT a cranck notion.

[[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 02:00, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

: I'm trying to figure out what is going on here.  ''E''=''mc''² most certainly indicates that mass and energy are related and interchangable quantities.  There is nothing that keeps any mass from being converted into energy under the proper circumstances or vice-versa.  For example, under normal conditions an electron stays an electron, but if it should encounter a [[positron]] you end up with two [[gamma-ray]]s:  That is pure mass-energy conversion.  Similarly, and energetic enough photon can be turned into an electron-positron pair!
: Also, I find this focus on apples to be most counter-productive, and that goes double for claiming that two apples together weight less than they do apart.  That may be true due to a loss of gravitational potential energy, but most people are not going to notice that and it makes the article look silly.  A better example is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, which weighs noticibly less than two free protons and two free neutrons do due to the loss of nuclear binding energy.  However, that is also better talked about in the article on [[mass-energy equivalence]] instead of in a bullet point. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:55, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

EMS(ems57fcva): I'll be brief. This so heavily discussed ''bullet point'' is NOT about energy conservation. A short explanation of E=Mc^2 (without spelling out the formula, what's the use?) and a motivating example should suffice. Your reversal of my edit (which had correct information), well-intentioned as it might have been, introduced incorrect information (see item below) and is not helpful to someone trying to grasp this subject.

::The ''E''=''mc''² equation actually appeared in an extension to Einstein's 1905 paper that came out a few months later.

Energy requirement to move a small mass (a ship) faster than speed of light

ok , there is this problem i had with mathematical formulas used in physics , most of all infinite concept
for example [[Zeno's paradox]] : An arrow cannot reach its target ever , because it has to pass through an infinity of points in space , which would take an infinite time, clearly an mathematical truth brought to absurdity by applying in to physics.

if one would consider same principle of mathematical abstraction one could see same effect applies to moving a small object through space at a speed bigger than that of light.
Sorry i don't have the formula with me (!) , but the universe didn't need it when actually breaking special relativity and expanding in early moments of Big Bang much faster than speed of light , carrying with it all the atoms he could find ... well i can't say for sure what this means ... either speed of light was much faster then ... or he didn't need exactly an infinite amount of energy just a very big amount .
Using my assumption it would be possible to estimate the numbers of atoms in the universe moved by the Big Bang , divide them by the numbers of atoms you need to move(a ship-medium size) and you could find a rough estimate of the energy needed to move it faster than light or rather say , same speed of Big Bang expansion.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Pef333|Pef333]] ([[User talk:Pef333|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pef333|contribs]]) 00:34, 21 October 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

That is, the signal would take on a value that resulted in the same signal being sent back. Even if you tried to apply an amplifier and limiter to convert analog to digital, there will be a value in the middle which cannot be pinned to the upper or lower limit.

:I've read similar things. Both in case of tachyons and in case of wormholes, any attempt to "change the past" won't work due to details of the physics. Of course, if you start with a constent mathematical description that allows for closed timelike loops, then you won't get a paradox; what happens in the loop is always self consistent.

: So, we could say that physics must somehow resolve this so-called "Tolman's Paradox", see also [[Tachyonic antitelephone| here]]. The obvious way would be to disallow faster than light signals, but if it allowed, there must be nontrivial effects which would prevent the signal from being used to set up the paradox.

==Postulates revisited==

Although Einstein derived his theory from 2 axioms mentioned in this article, it has been shown later that in fact only first of them is necessary. That is, special relativity can be derived only from Galileo's indistinguishability
of reference frames and uniformity/isotropy of space. It can be shown then that transformation law between moving reference frames must have Lorentz form, with ''c'' being an arbitrary parameter characterizing our timespace (possibly ''c''=∞). It is then a matter of experiment to determine the exact value of this parameter, and it turns out that it coincides with the speed of light.

I believe this purely-mechanical derivation of special relativity should be mentioned somewhere. Firstly because it is rarely taught, and thus most students never learn this fact; secondly because it implies that relativity could have in principle be discovered even in Newtonian times.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/128.12.157.38|128.12.157.38]] ([[User talk:128.12.157.38|talk]]) 10:10, 12 September 2007 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
::No, not Newtonian times, Maxwellian times. SR requires Maxwell's equations to be invariant under a shift of inertial frames.  That was how Einstein derived SR.

I think we should have a small discussion section about this issue in the article, because different physicists have different opinions on this matter. Clearly, before Relativity, Maxwell's equations were assumed to be valid only in the rest frame of the "aether". But if one assumes the validity of Maxwell's equations in any inertial frame then that implies special relativity and vice versa. You can take Coulomb's law for electrostatics and assume the validity of Special Relativity and derive Maxwell's equations from that.

Another issue that is not explained well in this article is that Lorentz invariance is more fundamental than Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. This is an artifact of deriving relativity from the two postulates. Hypothetically, suppose that the photon has a tiny mass, so that electromagnetism is described by Proca's equations instead of Maxwell equations. This, of course, would not affect Special Relativity at all!  [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] ([[User talk:Count Iblis|talk]]) 13:32, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

Besides the information collected by RAmesbury I think the time formula in STR is not correct. The correct time formulas are [1] and [2]. Please let me know if you can prove that the formula [1] or [2] is wrong. Thanks. Here are the formulas:

The correct time formula should be:

Ta' = Ta + (ao/C) ----- [1]

Ta represents the time of an event started at point a and Ta' stands for the time recorded by the camcorder at point o for the same event started at point a. ao stands for the distance from point a to point o and C represents the speed of light.
---------------------------------------------------------------------The proof for formula [1] is very simple. Since the 'picture of the event-starting' takes time to travel from point a to point o, when the camcorder recorded that 'picture of event-starting' the time should be (ao/C) after the actual starting time. Ta' = Ta + (ao/C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The time formula for a period of time should be:

Tab' = Tab + ((bo-ao)/C) ----- [2]

Tab represents the time period of the event started at point a and ended at point b and Tab' is the time period recorded by a camcorder at point o for the same event.

Based on FACT, for an event started Ta at point a and ended Tb at point b, the time period Tab = Tb-Ta is recorded as Tab' = Tab+((bo-ao)/C) by a camcorder at point o. When a person walks at a constant speed 0<V<C away from the camcorder, bo-ao = ba, so that the recorded time period is larger than the actual time period, time formula in this case is T' = ((C+V)/C)T. When V is approaching the answer of (V^3)+2C(V^2)-2(C^3) = 0 then T' = ((C+V)/C)T will be approaching the time formula in STR. That particular V is about 0.85C.

== Small discussion of classical limit c ---> infinity after mentioning postulates could be helpful ==

I don't have the time to do that myself today. The first postulate alone would be consistent with classical mechanics, if c were infinite. Of course, an infinite speed in classical mechanics is invariant for all inertial observers too :). We should make these comments and mention that the limit c --> infinity is the classical limit. We should also point out that  changing the value of c amounts to changing the units we use for measuring time or distances, so that it is not unphysical. So, the limit c ---> infinity can be interpreted as just an infinite rescaling of space relative to time. In this asymmetric scaling limit the relativistic universe becomes classical.

Possibly the existing article devoted to the Postulates (or better yet, an article on the axiomatic basis of special relativity) would be a better place for much of the discussion presently contains in the Postulates section of this article. However, much of this discussion has simply been driven by attempts to prevent erroneous POV from over-running the article. The main problem seems to be one of reading comprehension. Einstein wrote the following words 

: "The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light used there [i.e., in his derivation of special relativity] is of course contained in Maxwell's equations." 

Now, some editors wish to paraphrase this by saying "Einstein dropped the second postulate" in this paper. Needless to say (or so one would have thought), the above quote from Einstein says exactly the opposite of this paraphrase. The quote says that by assuming the validity of Maxwell's equations he is NOT dropping the lightspeed postulate, because the principle of invariant light speed is contained in Maxwell's equations. Hence he is not dropping anything, he is adding all the rest of the content of Maxwell's equations, and by the way, he is doing this (in contrast to the prior paper in which he derives the Lorentz transformation) in order to present a heuristic argument for mass-energy equivalence, and he apologized for stooping to assume Maxwell's equations considering that it was already clear they were invalid. Anyway, his statement says that he is NOT dropping the lightspeed principle. I object to paraphrasing this by saying he WAS dropping the lightspeed principle.[[User:Denveron|Denveron]] ([[User talk:Denveron|talk]]) 23:22, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

:: The principle of lightspeed invariance DOES appear in Einstein's paper on mass-energy equivalence, in the very sentence that you quoted. In that sentence he is re-asserting the fact that the derivation of the Lorentz transformation (and hence special relativity) in his paper devoted to that subject relies on this principle, and moreover that his heuristic argument for the equivalence of mass and energy also relies on that principle, as well as additional features of Maxwell's equations.
:: Look, read Einstein's 1907 paper on special relativity, and then read his 1909 paper on the derivation of special relativity, and then read his 1912 paper on the derivation of special relativity, and then read his 1916 book, and then read his 1921 Princeton lectures, and then read his 1922 lectures in Japan on the origin of special relativity, and then read his Nobel Prize acceptance speech (1922)... etc. etc.... and then read his 1936 essay on Relativity and Physics, and then read the discussion of the derivation of special relativity in The Evolution of Physics (1938), and then read his 1949 autobiography in which he discusses the derivation of special relativity, and then read all the other miscellaneous articles and notes he wrote on the foundations of special relativity. When you've done then, you will see that he steadfastly maintained that special relativity was founded on two principles, that of relativity and lightspeed invariance. Then if you read the four papers he wrote over the years given various heuristic arguments for mass-energy equivalence (which is a different subject from the derivation of special relativity) you will see he consistently invoked Maxwell's equations, but only reluctantly, and always noting that this entailed the lightspeed principle, so it was simply adding other postulates to the two needed for the derivation special relativity. If you insist, exact citations and quotations from all these references can be inserted into the article, but it's rather ridiculous, since it is quite well known and uncontroversial that special relativity does NOT follow from the principle of relativity alone. That principle allows only the derivation of the space-time transformation up to a constant whose value many be positive, zero, or negative, corresponding to Euclidean, Galilean, or Minkowskian relativity, and to quantify the relations in physically meaningful terms it is necessary to associate the constant with some physically identifiable value, which Einstein did by associating it with the speed of light. This is not controversial. Every reputable source, both historical and modern, agrees with this. I urge you to acquaint yourself with the vast literature on this subject, and to stop trying to insert your erroneous and unsourced POV assertions into the article. Thanks.

::::: Already asked and answered multiple times. As explained in the previous comments, Einstein paper on the inertia of energy was not a re-derivation of special relativity, it was an extension of special relativity, making use of results from special relativity derived, based on the two fundamental postulates, in the previous paper. He wrote:

:::::::<b>Based on these fundamental principles [The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light used there is of course contained in Maxwell's equations], I derived the following result</b>, among others...

::::: This points explicitly to his use of the lightspeed principle to derive the basic results that he then proceeded to use in order to argue heuristically for the transmutability of energy and mass. Now, the question YOU have not answered is why Einstein wrote "Based on these fundamental principles" (plural), rather than "principle" (singular). What "principleS" was he referring to?  You have claimed that in this paper he derived special relativity based on just a single principle (relativity), and yet this is flatly contradicted on two counts: (1) he is not deriving special relativity in this paper, and (2) he refers here to the paper in which he DID derive special relativity and says explicitly that it was based on multiple principleS, one of which he acknowledges was lightspeed invariance.

Let me try to address what I suspect is the source of your misunderstanding. Maxwell's equations, per se, are just a set of symbols, and have no physical meaning unless we assign to them some definite operational significance. It is entirely possible to reconcile "Maxwell's equations" with the principle of relativity. In fact, Maxwell himself did this. He believed with near certainty that electromagnetic effects were fundamentally mechanical, and that the mechanical basis of electromagnetism would eventually be discovered. He certainly proposed mechanical models that he hoped would lead eventually to an understanding of the ether. He also firmly belived in the principle of relativity, and wrote about it at length. Of course, he had in mind Galilean relativity, but the point is that the principle of relativity is not irreconcilable, a priori, with some construal of Maxwell's equations, because the meanings of the symbols are open to interpretation. In particular, Maxwell's equations are expressed in terms of space and time coordinates, but the operational meanings of these coordinates were ambiguous. Einstein saw that it was necessary, before we can even interpret Maxwell's equations, we must agree on what coordinate systems they apply to, and how those coordinate systems are operationally defined. This ambiguity also appears in the parameters representing the properties of permittivity and permeability. Maxwell's equations, themselves, don't tell us what these are properties OF. Maxwell (and Lorentz and everyone else before Einstein) regarded them as properties of the ether (which for all they knew was fundamentally mechanical entity). Likewise Maxwell's equations involve a parameter with units of a speed, but doesn't tell us the operational meaning of this parameter. 

Prior to Einstein it was believed this speed was relative to the ether. This is perfectly consistent with the principle of relativity, provided we regard the ether as possessing physical properties and participating in physical processes somewhat like ordinary matter. But of course this view suggests that we can have different speeds relative to the ether (unless it is totally dragged with us, in which case there are other difficulties), so it ought to be possible to determine our speed relative to the ether. But, as Einstein noted, efforts to do this were consistently unsuccessful. The way out was to adopt this inability as a principle (like to inability to make a perpetual motion machine is a principle of thermodynamics), and this amounts to assigning a particular operational meaning to Maxwell's equations, which requires an operational definition of the space and time variables appearing in those parameters. Einstein saw that the stipulation of c (the operational speed of light) as a universal constant, independent of the state of motion through any hypothetical ether (or the vacuum), along with the stipulation of relativity, is sufficient to operationally determine the meanings of the space and time variables, as well as the parameters appearing in Maxwell's equations.

So this is why Einstein could not simply postulate Maxwell's equations, he saw that he needed a fundamental principle that would give unambiguous meaning to Maxwell's equations, and more generally to all physical laws involving space and time coordinates. Furthermore, he already knew Maxwell's equations themselves were not fundamentally correct (because they can't account for radiation), which explains why he said "it was as if the ground had been taken out from under us", and the only way forward was to identify some fundamental principle, in addition to the principle of relativity, that would suffice to establish the operational meanings of the variables and parameters appearing in physical laws. The necessary and sufficient principle is the invariance of lightspeed with respect to states of motion.

Of course, once we have established the Lorentz transformation and the meanings of the space and time variables for different frames of reference, it is then trivial to say "assume Maxwell's equations are valid in all frames of reference", but this has meaning only because we have previously defined how space and time coordinates transform from one frame of reference to another. Without that, the application of the principle of relativity to Maxwell's equations is hopelessly ambiguous.

Look, I'm not saying anything new or novel here. This is all yawningly old-hat to anyone who is acquainted with the vast literature on this subject. It is somewhat more subtle and complicated than newbies are often led to believe by their freshman physics instructors, but the above considerations are why people regard Einstein as genius, rather than an idiot, for basing special relativity on the principles of relativity and lightspeed invariance, which have survived all the subsequent advances in physics, because they weren't tied to any particular physical law (e.g., Newton's laws or Maxwell's laws), but to the most basic and assured principles, necessary and sufficient to give operational meaning to ANY physical law. This was such a brilliant insight that it seems a shame to bastardize it by the "original insights" of certain Wikipedia editors who frankly don't understand the first thing about theoretical physics.

Having said all this, let me also point out that it is all irrelevant. Wikipedia policies were designed specifically to avoid the kind of "honest debate" that some editors propose. Per Wikipedia policy, Wikipedia is NOT the place for debate (honest or otherwise) of the subject matter. Jimbo Wales realized that physics cranks can NEVER be convinced. That is essentially the DEFINITION of a physics crank. Hence, the Wikipedia rule is to base decisions for inclusion not on whether something is true or false, but whether it has appeared in a reputable published source. The version of the article I favor is FAR more sourced than the original research version ("some people think") that other editors are promoting. I contend that the fully sourced NPOV version is the one that should be adopted.[[Special:Contributions/63.24.122.252|63.24.122.252]] ([[User talk:63.24.122.252|talk]]) 18:31, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

Tackling the only substantive point you make: the plurality of "principleS", as you put it.  Einstein is quite explicit.  One principle is the principle of relativity, '''the other is Maxwell's equations.'''  He is quite explicit.  Here are paragraphs 2 & 3::

{{quote|'''I based that investigation on the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space, together with the Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space, and in addition the principle that:--'''

''The laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of the alternative, to which of two systems of coordinates, in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other, these alterations of state are referred (principle of relativity).
''

'''With these principles[The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is of course contained in Maxwell's equations], I derived'''........}}

I do like the "of course" bit.  Note that he is saying this is how he produced the results appearing the first paper as well.  
--[[User:MichaelCPrice|Michael C. Price]] <sup>[[User talk:MichaelCPrice|talk]]</sup> 21:38, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

You previously claimed that "Einstein did not introduce [Maxwell's equations] as an explicit postulate, any more than he did the rest of classical physics", but now you conceed (finally!)that he adopted Maxwell's equations as one of his "principleS" in his paper giving a heuristic argument for mass-energy equivalence, and you also conceed (presumably) the obvious fact that this is (as Einstein noted with the "of course" that you're so fond of) tantamount to adopting the principle of lightspeed invariance. 

If you're still having trouble grasping this, ask yourself what it means to adopt Maxwell's equations as a principle. Those equations can be reconciled with the principle of relativity in (infinitely) many different ways. To give this principle meaning, we must assert (among other things) that the parameters appearing in those equations take the same numerical values when evaluated with respect to any system of inertial coordinates, as operationally defined. Now, the parameters characterizing Maxwell's equations are the electrostatic and magnetic units, whose ratio is the speed of light, so the only way of postulating Maxwell's equations in a sense compatible with special relativity is to assert that the speed of light has the same numerical value with respect to any system of inertial coordinates. If you do not explicitly stipulate this, the postulate of "Maxwell's equations" is hopelessly ambiguous, and does not suffice to single out the Minkowski metric. Conversely, if you DO stipulate the invariance of the ratio of electric to magnetic units, then none of the remaining assumptions entailed in Maxwell's equations (some of which are invalid) are needed. This is why, as Einstein specifically said, he avoided postulating Maxwell's equations in the derivation of the Lorentz transformation.

Look, the result from the first paper on which he bases the second paper is the equation for the energy of an electromagnetic wave with respect to relatively moving systems of inertial coordinates. This comes from Section 8 of the first paper, which is in the "Electrodynamic Part" of that paper, in which he applies the Lorentz transformation  - derived in the "Kinematic Part" of the paper, based on the two postulates - to Maxwell's equations. At the conclusion of the Kinematic Part he says

''<i>We have now derived the required propositions of the kinematics that correspond to <b>our two principles</b>, and we will now proceed to show their application in electrodynamics.</i>''

So you see, he has already derived the Lorentz transformation, which as he repeatedly stressed is the entire content of special relativity, and he is proceeding to apply this to one particular class of physical phenomena, namely, Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. In this part of the paper he derives the relativistic expression for the energy of an electromagnetic wave (in accord with Maxwell's equations), and it is this result that he uses in the second paper. This is why he says in the second paper, referring to the first, "There I based myself on the Maxwell-Hertz equations". He is saying this was the basis of the expression for the energy of an electromagnetic wave, but of course the relativistic form comes from applying the kinematics of special relativity, which was derived in the first part of the earlier paper based on the two postulates of relativity and lightspeed invariance.

If you have any understanding at all of the actual content of those two papers, his statements are perfectly clear and cannot possibly be mis-interpreted. Your claims are falsified in so many different ways that is becomes ever more tedious to enumerate them. And you conspicuously decline to reconcile your claims about Einstein "dropping the second postulate" with the fact that in over a dozen papers written over the next fifty years of his life he consistently asserted the primacy of the lightspeed postulate, often listing it first rather than second (which is why it's not good to refer to them as "first" and "second" postulates). And you refuse to comment on why he repeatedly made statements explaining why he based special relativity on those two postulates and NOT on Maxwell's equations. And on and on.

All we're doing here is proving the wisdom of the Wikipedia rules designed to suppress physics cranks. It does no good to argue with physics cranks. All we can do is insist that the article contain ONLY sourced statements from reputable publications. My version is thoroughly sourced. The alternate version is essentially just an unsourced statement of some editors opinions.

:: Already asked and answered (multiple times). The paper you are referring to does NOT present a derivation of the special relativity or the Lorentz transformation, so the principles on which the argument in that paper are based are not relevant to the principles on which the derivation of Lorentz invariance (which is the content of special relativity) is based. Now, Einstein does refer back to the earlier paper, but as I've already taken the trouble of explaining in detail, he is referring to the basis of the expression for the energy of an electromagnetic wave, which was derived in Part 2 of the previous paper, where he applies the Lorentz transformation to Maxwell's equations. This is the meaning of the sentence you keep quoting. Your claims are false because you present the quotation as if it was describing the principles for deriving the Lorentz transformation, which it very clearly was not. Please re-read the previous discussion which explains exactly what that sentence was referring to. This is not a controversial point. Any Einstein scholar will tell you the same thing.

Of course, the assumption of Maxwell's equations (in this context) entails among other things the assumption of the constancy of the speed of light.

Your attempt to contradict this well-established fact by quoting his comment from a paper on a <b>different</b> subject, and trying to mis-lead the reader by calling it "his second paper on special relativity", and presenting this as if he was talking about deriving the Lorentz transformation, is both dishonest and misleading. I explained above that the result from the first paper that he used in the second paper to argue for mass-energy equivalence was the expression from Part 2 of the first paper, AFTER deriving the Lorentz transformation, where he applies the principles of special relativity to the subject of Maxwell's equations. Hence the reference in the second paper to the use of Maxwell's equations in deriving that result. I don't know how to say this any more clearly. I can only suggest that people read both papers for themselves. Look at the result that Einstein is referring to in the second paper, and note that it comes from Section 8 of the first paper, which is in Part 2, AFTER the derivation of the Lorentz transformation.

== The section ?3 of the 1905 paper ==

The second equation in the section ?3 of the1905 paper is established on the assumption that when Einstein used the method defined in the section ?1 to synchronize all clocks  in the stationary system K he could still use the method ?1 to synchronize a slave clock S in system k to a master clock M at the origin of system k. System k is moving away from system K at constant velocity v with axes y’ and z’ parallel to axes y and z, and axes x’ lay on axes x. We also let all clocks be in all respects alike. We will look into that assumption in 3 situations:

1.	For the situation when the stationary system K is not moving at all. It is easy to prove above assumption is invalid. We will prove Regulation one and use it to verify the situation 1. In method ?1, let the emitting point be O, the reflecting point be R, and the ending point be O’. Let OR and O’R represent the distances between related two points.

: Regulation one: If we can use method ?1 to synchronize the slave clock B to the master clock A then OR=O’R. To prove it we start from the given condition that the clock B can be and is synchronized to the clock A by method ?1. That means at the time the clock A showed tA when the ray emitted the clock B would also show tA and both clocks showed same time for tB and tA’ too. Since tB-tA=tA’-tB, to both clocks A and B, the light ray spent equal time from point O to R and from point R to O’. Since the speed of light is not related to the speed of the emitter we time the same speed by the same time period and get the same distance OR=O’R. Regulation one is proved. Logically speaking, the reverse of this regulation is also true: if OR is not equal to O’R then we cannot use method ?1 to synchronize the clock B to the clock A.

If the system K is not moving at all then the system k is moving. Let the ray emitted at point Om and reflected at point Rs then ended at point Om’. Since the system k is moving along x axes, we have point Om’ in between points Om and Rs. That means OmRs>Om’Rs. According to Regulation one, we are not allowed to use method ?1 to synchronize the clock S to the clock M in the system k. 

Under this first situation, the assumption Einstein used to derive the second equation in the section ?3 of the1905 paper is not valid. Hence the proof of Lorentz Transformation in the section ?3 following that second equation in the section ?3 is not valid. Now, let us look into more complicated situation 2.

2.	For the situation when the system K moves and we can use method ?1 to synchronize clocks in any system to master clocks in the system K. We will prove that the system K cannot move. For a given master clock N in the system K, let the clock N emit two rays at point On to two clocks S1 and S2 in the stationary system at locations point R1 and R2 where point On is the center point of the segment connecting R1 and R2. We have OnR1=OnR2. Let the ending points be O1’ and O2’ then we have OnR1=O1’R1 and OnR2=O2’R2. That means the point O1’ is on the sphere of radius OnR1 and center R1 while the point O2’ is on the sphere of radius OnR2 and center R2. Since On is the only point on both spheres, it is impossible for the clock N to move to one sphere and receive both reflection rays. That means, the clock N cannot move. That means any point of the system K cannot move and the system K is not moving at all. We proved that the situation 2 has the same result as situation 1.

3.	For the situation when the system K moves and we can use method ?1 to synchronize clocks in the system K to each other. I have solved only part of the solution that is when all clocks in the system K are moving slower than 0.7C related to the emitting point O, reflecting point R, and ending point O’ in the synchronization, where C is the speed of light.

: Regulation two: I will prove that within above situation if all clocks in the system K can be synchronized to each other by the method ?1, then the system K cannot not move at all. 

If no clock is moving, Regulation two is proved. If some clocks are moving, we select the one with fastest moving speed and name it the master clock A, the moving speed of the clock A is smaller than 0.7C as we assumed. Our next step is to build a coordinate system with point O as the origin and select the direction where the clock A is moving to, when the ray emitted, as positive direction of x axes. Let us synchronize the clock X located at U(1,0,0) to the master clock A at O(0,0,0). That means, we emit the light ray at point O to the expected reflecting location of clock X. Let the reflection point be R then the end point of the synchronization be O’. We will prove that if the moving speed of the clock A is smaller than 0.7C then to synchronize the clock X to the master clock A is impossible so long as the moving speed of the clock X is not faster than the clock A. 

To make the proof easier, we reduce the unit length so that the end point O’ will be so close to the point O that it is on the x axes with coordinate (ox,0,0) and the moving speed of the clock A is a constant speed in that period of time. Let P be the center point between O and O’, then (ox/2, 0,0) is the coordinate of the point P. If we can synchronize the clock X to the clock A, then there is a reflecting point R that OR=RO’ and we have PR=OU=1. When the clock A moved from the point O to P, the clock X moved from the unit point U(1,0,0) to R and the ray moved from the point O to R. If the speed of the clock A is less than 0.7C, we have UR>1>OP. However, that is against to our selection that the clock A has the fastest moving speed. That means whichever clock has the fastest speed would not be able to synchronize a clock X at the direction of its moving. That means to synchronize all other clocks in the system K, a master clock cannot have moving speed at all if it is not faster than or equal to 0.7C.

: The second equation in the section ?3 of the1905 paper is not true when all clocks in the system K have moving speed less than 0.7C. Because in that case we have proved that the system K is not moving at all, related to the event points, so that according to situation 1, the method ?1 could not be used for the system k. 

4. For the situation when some clocks in system K is moving faster than 0.7C related to the emitting point O, reflecting point R, and ending point O’ of the synchronization, where C is the speed of light, I don’t have a solution yet. I have to think about it.

[[User:John C. Huang|John C. Huang]] ([[User talk:John C. Huang|talk]]) 01:16, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

4. I have found the solution. For the situation that clocks in the system K have moving speed less than the speed of light we will prove that if all clocks in the system K can use the method ?1 to synchronize each other then clocks in the system K cannot move at all.

In situation 3, let the moving speed of the master clock A be smaller than the speed of light and let another slave clock Y at (1/2,0,0) be synchronized by the clock A at the same time. Let the reflecting point be Ry and the ending point be Oy(oy,0,0) so that the point Py(oy/2,0,0) is at middle of points O and Oy. Compared with the clock X, the clock Y is closer to the clock A so that we should have oy<ox. 

When the clock A moved from point O to Py, the clock Y moves from (1/2,0,0) to Ry. Since the clock Y is always staying at the middle of clocks A and X at any time in any way the system K moves, when the clock A was at point Py and the clock Y was at point Ry we could locate the clock X at a point Rx, PyRx=1. Now, let us look into the way the clock X moved when we synchronized it to the clock A. The clock X moved away from x axes up to the reflecting point then started moving back to x axes after that so that in the whole process of synchronization, the distance between the clock X and x axes is less than 1 except at the reflecting point that the distance is equal to 1. We proved that the point Rx is the same as the point R, so that the point Py is the same as the point P and oy=ox. That is conflict to the fact that oy<ox.

We have proved that the clock A with the fastest moving speed in the system K cannot use the method ?1 to synchronize both clocks X and Y at the same time. That means to use the method ?1 to synchronize all clocks in the system K to each other, every clock in the system K cannot move at all. Per situation 1, Einstein could not use the method ?1 to synchronize two clocks in the moving system k.

== The second postulate ==

Carnildo's statement is: "The second postulate is three separate claims:
 
1. The speed of light is the same to all inertial observers
2. The speed of light is the same in all directions 
3. The speed of light does not depend on the velocity of the emitter
 
The second claim was verified by the Michelson-Morley experiments, and the third was verified by the experiments that disproved emitter theory. 
For the third claim, [1] cites Alvager et al., Physics Letters 12, 260 (1964) as being the definitive study. 
I don't know of any experiments that that have verified the first claim, but I'm sure they're out there. 
--Carnildo 22:46, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)" and he provided some verification about "one way" speed of light for the second claim. 

I will try to make a test for the first claim and hope Carnildo can help to make it better or make it not valid:

We need 3 timers which are able to record nanoseconds. One built into a switch on-off red light bulb, one built into a switch on-off yellow light bulb, and one built into a camcorder. We synchronize the timers to the best we can and write down their related times: Tr, Ty, and Tc. We let Mr. Cam sets up the camcorder to record two events started from Tc+9 minutes to Tc+11 minutes. Mr. Red put the set of red light bulb on a table 30 meters away from the camcorder performs the first event, sets up the red light bulb be turned on at Tr+10 minutes then turned off at 20 nanoseconds later while Mr. Yel put the set of yellow light bulb on a tea table in between the table and camcorder, 6 meters away from the camcorder, performs the second event, sets up the yellow light bulb be turned on at Ty+10 minutes and 80 nanoseconds then turned off at 20 nanoseconds later. 

We don't let Mr. Cam know the starting time of events. At Tc+22 minutes, three workers look at the recorded time which should show that the red light and yellow light were turned on at about Tc+10 minutes and 100 nanoseconds and lasted for 20 nanoseconds. They then calculate the speed of light from the known distance: 

Mr. Red has 30 m / (100-0) ns = 0.3 m/ns and Mr. Yel has 6 m / (100-80) ns = 0.3 m/ns but Mr. Cam has some difficulty. The recorded two events happened at the same time means the event-starting pictures arrived the camcorder at the same time, Tc+10 minutes and 100 nanoseconds; but what are the event starting times? What is your answer? There are two answers, general publics will say according to the recorded vedio, both light bulbs was turned on at Tc+10 minutes and 100 nanoseconds; the other answer is don't know, depend on how far away are the light bulbs and since the speed of light is to be decided, unable to calculate the time. If Mr. Cam is one of the general public, then the result of calculation is 30 m / 0 ns and 6 m / 0 ns, unlimited fast. That is different from the results of Mr. Red and Mr. Yel.

Thanks for your concern. People don't know much about C, the speed of light. Photons do not need acceleration to reach C and the only light we can see or a camcorder can record is the light runs directly into our eyes or the lens. If the speed of gravity force and electromagnetic force are C then no matter how strong the electromagnetic force is applied to the electron, the speed of that electron can not be higher than C like a balloon pulled by a train cannot go faster than the train no matter how powerful the train is. We don't know much about C. 

The measurements you mentioned about were not designed to verify the first claim. What is the speed of light recorded by a camcorder? Is that C? How do you calculate it?

: I have found a way to verify that the speed of light is unlimited fast when it runs toward the camcorder and the speed of light is C/2 when it runs away from the camcorder. 

:: We replaced Mr. Yel by Mr. 24m and Mr. 12m, we also replaced the yellow light-bulb by two glass rings of diameters 24 inches and 12 inches both with width of 6 inches. The ring24 had clear bottom half and transitable red upper half (so that some of the red light would go through and some of the red light would reflect) and the ring12 had clear upper half and transitable yellow bottom half. We then replaced the red light-bulb by clear light-bulb and removed the tea table. Let Mr. 24m stretched out his right arm held the ring24 at distance of 24 meters away from the camcorder and Mr. 12m stretched out his left arm held the ring12 at distance of 12 meters away from the camcorder the centers of the clear light-bulb, ring24, ring12, and the lens of the camcorder were about on one straight line. Then Mr. Cam started recording and Mr. Red turned on the clear light-bulb for 20 ns. Then we reviewed what was recorded. The result should be quite like all the center light, upper red, and bottom yellow all lighted up at Tc+10 minutes and 100 ns and lasted for 20 ns. That verified that the speed of light from ring24 to ring12 is unlimited fast to the observer.

Then, we let Mr. Cam moved to under the table to record both rings. We let Mr. Cam started recording from Tc+29 minutes to Tc+31 minutes. Let Mr. Red turned on the clear light-bulb from Tr+30 minutes to Tr+30 minutes and 20 ns. After that, we reviewed the recorded result. We should see ring24 lighted at around Tc+30 minutes and 40 ns, lasted 20 ns; then ring12 lighted at around Tc+30 minutes and 120 ns, lasted 20 ns. The calculated speed of light from ring24 to ring12 is about (24m-12m)/(120ns-40ns)=0.15m/ns and that is about C/2. Do you think this experiment make sense?

==Maxwell's Equations are NOT a Postulate of Special Relativity==

Some editors have suggested inserting claims in the article to the effect that the lightspeed invariance postulate follows from Maxwell's equations, and that therefore the lightspeed postulate can be replaced by simply postulating Maxwell's equations. This is not accurate either technically or historically. As Einstein later explained, he already knew by 1905 (see his 1905 paper on light quanta) that Maxwell's equations were not fundamental, and in fact were wrong. He very specifically avoided basing special relativity on Maxwell's equations. Of course, he also explained in several places that if we assumed Maxwell's equations had the same form in all systems of inertial coordinates then the lightspeed postulate follows, but this is to assume much more than is needed. Also note that Lorentz assumed Maxwell's equations too, but only for the system of space and time coordinates at rest in the ether, and hence Maxwell's equations need not be understood to imply lightspeed invariance. Maxwell himself understood this and wrote about it. Look, whole books have been written about why Einstein specifically chose to base special relativity on the two postulated that appear in the 1905 paper. It would bog down the article to explain all this in detail. But the article needs to be written in a way that is consistent with both the technical facts and the historical facts, and this can only be done by people who are acquainted with both. Notice that the claims inserted in the article about special relativity being based on Maxwell's equations are unsourced. This is because the editor(s) inserting those claims are really just inserting (erroneous) "original research", i.e., their own (mis)conceptions. It would be beneficial to the article (in my opinion) to remove those erroneous and misguided statements.[[User:Denveron|Denveron]] ([[User talk:Denveron|talk]]) 15:51, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

:: I believe you're mistaken when you say no one is claiming ME are a postulate of SR. Here is what you inserted into the article in a recent edit: "Einstein derived the second postulate about the invariance of the speed of light from the first postulate, by applying the principle of relativity to Maxwell's equations". Needless to say, this is a weird statement in several respects... for example, it talks about "deriving" a postulate. But even if we overlook this weirdness, your assertion is clearly that the foundation of special relativity is the principle of relativity combined with Maxwell's equations, from which (you assert) the lightspeed postulate is "derived". Hence you are making Maxwell's equations an underlying postulate, smuggling it in through the back door. This, as I explained above, is wrong. Einstein specifically avoided basing special relativity on Maxwell's equations, because he already knew Maxwell's equations were not fundamentally correct. Of course, he also knew they contained an important kernal of truth, which he extracted in the form of the lightspeed invariance postulate, which is just as valid in quantum electrodynamics as it was in Maxwellian electromagnetism.
:: To say "Einstein derived special relativity from Maxwell's equations" is so vague as to be neither true nor false. Certainly the Lorentz invariance of Maxwell's equations was a crucial fact, so in that sense it is true. But Maxwell's equations were already known to be not fundamental, so it was necessary to identify the key feature of those equations, and the single simple fact that must underly any successful theory of electromagnetism. This was the principle of lightspeed invariance. It is formally a principle that was inferred from (among other things) the success of Maxwell's equations, but this principle cannot be "derived from" Maxwell's equations unless we first postulate Maxwell's equations, which we know are wrong at the fundamental level.
:: I would just say that any claims in the article ought to be supported by direct quotes from reputable sources, and not just paraphrases based on editors assurances that they have "read many times that Einstein derived SR from MEs". The undeniable fact is that Einstein's 1905 paper explicitly derives special relativity not from Maxwell's equations, but from two principles, one being lightspeed invariance. This has proven to be a sound basis, even after Maxwell's equations were shown to be wrong. Claims that special relativity assumes the validity of Maxwell's equations are simply wrong. This is one of the great features of special relativity... the solidity of its premises.[[Special:Contributions/63.24.127.205|63.24.127.205]] ([[User talk:63.24.127.205|talk]]) 17:18, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

:::: First, one does not derive postulates, so the weirdness (to put it kindly) of your assertions is beyond dispute. Second, the point of view you are expressing is a well-known and (unfortunately) fairly common misunderstanding among relativity newbies. When you say the lightspeed postulate follows from applying the relativity postulate to the laws of electricity and magnetism you are assuming those laws are given in advance, just as you could assume the laws of mechanics were given in advance. However, both the Newtonian and the Maxwellian laws are wrong (as we now know). Einstein says the relativity postulate must apply to the laws of electrodynamics as well as to the laws of mechanics - <i>whatever those laws may be</i>. In point of fact, it turned out that the laws of both mechanics and electrodynamics had to be modified in order to make them consistent with the principle of relativity and the principle of lightspeed invariance. The laws of mechanics were modified immediately beginning in 1905, and the laws of electrodynamics were modified when quantum mechanics was finally reconciled with special relativity by Dirac, eventually resulting in quantum electrodynamics. The point is, neither the laws of mechanics nor the laws of electrodynamics are premises of special relativity. Rather, special relativity imposes conditions on the form those laws must take.
:::: Of course, it is true that Einstein included a footnote about Maxwell's equations in the "Inertia of Energy" paper in 1906, but that footnote does not say that special relativity is based on Maxwell's equations. It merely observes (correctly) that if Maxwell's equations are valid in terms of every system of inertial coordinates, then the lightspeed invariance follows. But as Einstein already knew, Maxwell's equations are NOT valid in ANY system of inertial coordinates, so it would have been considerably less brilliant of him to found special relativity on those equations. In the "Inertia" paper he is simply trying to make the lightspeed principle seem more plausible to people who were not accoustomed to it by relating it to Maxwell's equations, with the tacit proviso that they are held to be valid in terms of all systems of inertial coordinates.
:::: This is why I didn't want to get into this in detail, because to give an accurate representation of the fact, you must include not just the footnote in one paper that doesn't even support your point, but the texts of the dozens of presentations of special relativity that Einstein wrote over his lifetime, in which he clearly and repeatedly emphasized that special relativity is based on lightspeed invariance, NOT on Maxwell's equations. You are obviously intent on inserting your POV into the article, and it will be quite easy to bury you in citations proving you wrong, but is this really a good use of anyone's time? Why not go and acquaint yourself with the vast literature?[[Special:Contributions/63.24.32.26|63.24.32.26]] ([[User talk:63.24.32.26|talk]]) 20:07, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

:::: One more point - the quotation of the footnote you gave was incorrect, as it omitted the two crucial words "used there". You aren't entirely to blame for this, because those words were omitted from the Dover booklet translation that most newbies read. To see what Einstein actually wrote, see the original German, or read the English translation in the Collected Papers (Princeton University Press). By saying "the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light USED THERE" he is re-affirming that this is the principle on which special relativity is founded, and then going on to add in a comforting way (for people who have more faith in Maxwell's equations than in Einstein's lightspeed principle) that Maxwell's equations imply the lightspeed invariance... with the tacit assumption that Maxwell's equations are valid with respect to every system of inertial coordinates, but since c appears in Maxwell's equations (as the ratio of electrostatic to magnetic units), this tacit assumption is tantamount to the assumption of lightspeed invariance. So lightspeed invariance follows from the assumption of lightspeed invariance. This is the only aspect of Maxwell's equations on which special relativity is founded. Hence your insistence on trying to give readers the impression that special relativity is based on some feature of Maxwell's equations other than lightspeed invariance itself is both technically wrong and historically inaccurate.

Answers:
1) The words "used there" obviously make a very significant difference, which is why the more careful translators DID include it. Your (incorrect) version of the quote was the basis of your (erroneous) claim that the lightspeed postulate was not contained in the Inertia paper, but then you quoted the note that contained it, referring back to the foundational paper.
2) Don't care.
3) You call your mis-contrual of a mis-quotation an "unimpeachable source". I would hate to see what you consider an impeachable source.
4) You are confused. The topic here is special relativity, which is just as valid in quantum electrodynamics as in mechanics. Of course, neither of these are in their classical form, but that's the whole point. They had to be modified to be consistent with special relativity. If we took Maxwell's equations for granted (as you suggest we should do in founding special relativity), it would be incompatible with quantum electrodynamics. Fortunately, special relativity is not founded on Maxwell's equations, it is founded on the existence of an invariant speed. Your efforts to conflate these two things are not helpful.
5) Done. See the edited article.[[Special:Contributions/63.24.112.17|63.24.112.17]] ([[User talk:63.24.112.17|talk]]) 23:31, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

Your entire position is one of OR, since the quotations provided do not demonstrate your case, only the lack of your ability to see both sides of the argument.  The fact remains that back in 1905 Einstein dropped the 2nd postulate because he could derive it from the principle of relativity applied to Maxwell's equations.  Here I quote the opening of his 2nd paper with the footnote inserted:
{{quote|The results of the previous investigation lead to a very interesting conclusion, which is here to be deduced.

I '''based that investigation on the Maxwell-Hertz equations''' for empty space, together with the '''Maxwellian expression for the electromagnetic energy of space''', and in addition the principle that:--

''The laws by which the states of physical systems alter are independent of the alternative, to which of two systems of coordinates, in uniform motion of parallel translation relatively to each other, these alterations of state are referred (principle of relativity).''

With these principles (''The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light used there is '''of course contained in Maxwell's equations'''.'') as my basis I deduced .....}}

Maxwell's equations are both too much and not enough to serve as a foundation for special relativity, and this is clear from all the vast literature on this subject. They are not enough because it is entirely possible to reconcile a Lorentzian view of Maxwell's equations with the principle of relativity without implying invariant light speed. (See Lorentz's theory.) They are too much because if you add the (necessary) stipulation that they must apply in the same form, with the same ratio of electric to magnetic units, in terms of all inertial frames, then they not only imply the invariance of light speed, they also imply a whole lot of other things... many of which are not true. Furthermore, to say that you can eliminate the second postulate by substituting another postulate (Maxwell's equations) and declining to call it a postulate is just, well, I'll refrain from characterizing it.

:: Einstein's paper on the inertia of energy is not a second attempt to derive special relativity, it is an attempt to show that at least some forms of energy have inertia, and for this limited derivation he stipulated Maxwell's equations (as covariant laws). Of course, this postulate contains as a subset the postulate of invariant lightspeed, so it in no way obviates the lightspeed postulate. It augments the lightspeed postulate with even more postulates, some of which Einstein already knew to be false, but which he needed in order to make his argument for the inertia of energy. Now, this particular derivation of mass-energy equivalence was criticized by many scientists, including Planck, not least because of its reliance on Maxwell's equations. (This derivation has also been assessed as circular reasoning, even by some admirers of Einstein.) In his 1907 paper Einstein felt compelled to apologize for having based his argument on Maxwell's equations, which was unnecessary, and which he already knew to be wrong, but he justified it by saying that he thought the use of Maxwell's equations would lead to reasonable results in the particular cases where he used them. But the point is that it's utterly idiotic to say that Einstein "dropped the 2nd postulate" when he (on these rare occasions) postulated Maxwell's equations. Those equations are then "the 2nd postulate", and they contain the invariant lightspeed postulate (which we already know is sufficient to derive the Lorentz transformation) PLUS many more individual postulates. It's as if you brought a cow, two horses, and three pigs into the barn, and then you claim that you didn't bring a cow into the barn. Please. It is very well known that the principle of relativity, alone, is not sufficient to single out special relativity. Some other postulate is required. Now, it is certainly true that there is a wide choice of possible 2nd postulates to augment the relativity postulate, but they all amount to lightspeed invariance. See, for example, the discussion in Rindler. This is all very old hat, and goes all the way back to the early days of relativity, with the likes of Ignatowsky arguing with Ehrenfest. I urge you to acquaint yourself with the literature on this subject.[[Special:Contributions/63.24.124.104|63.24.124.104]] ([[User talk:63.24.124.104|talk]]) 04:04, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

Michael, there is not the remotest similarity between Maxwell's work and Einstein's work.

I agree with you that Einstein claimed to have drawn on the so-called Maxwell-Hertz equations. But in what respect? It is true that the E = mc^2 can be derived from a lesser known equation by Maxwell that is connected with radiation pressure. But that radiation pressure equation never appears in either modern sets of Maxwell's equations or in Maxwell's original eight equations.

Maybe it is the radiation pressure equation that Einstein is referring to but he doesn't make that clear.

At any rate, there is nothing at all in Maxwell's original works that says that the speed of light is a universal constant.

I had always assumed that the constancy of the speed of light was an Einstein idea which he derived from the Michelson-Morley experiment. 

Perhaps you would like to tell me what exactly Einstein saw in Maxwell's equations that led him to his theory of relativity. For Maxwell, the speed of light was the mach number in a sea of elastic molecular vortices and it never possessed any of the special relativity properties that Einstein later attributed to it.

Michael, we had already agreed that Einstein said that in his 1905 paper. But it just goes to show how little Einstein understood Maxwell's equations. because they don't imply the universal constancy of the speed of light. If you read Maxwell's papers, you will see that he calculated that speed using Newton's eqation for the speed of sound in connection with an elastic medium. He saw the speed of light as the mach number for that medium measured at a stationary point in that medium. [[User:David Tombe|David Tombe]] ([[User talk:David Tombe|talk]]) 11:39, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

:Regarding to some discussions above: Einstein's 2nd postulate and his view of Maxwell's equations was based on Lorentz's formulation of Maxwell's theory (the so called "Maxwell-Lorentz equations"). 
:# Einstein said in his [[:s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|1909-paper]]: ''"According to Lorentz's theory, if a light beam propagates through space, it does so with a speed c in the resting frame K of the ether, independently of the state of motion of the emitting object. Let's call this the '''invariance of the speed of light principle'''."''
:# And in his [http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1912_38_1059-1064.pdf 1912-paper] Einstein wrote: ''"It is widely known that based on the principle of relativity alone a theory of transformation laws of space and time can not be established. It is known that this is connected with the relativity of "simultaneity" and "the shape of moving bodies". To fill this gap, I '''borrowed''' from H.A. Lorentz's stationary light-ether theory the '''principle of constancy of the speed of light''', which like the relativity principle is a physical condition that is only justified by the pertinent experience (experiments by Fizeau, Rowland, etc.)."'' 
:# And in his [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-lecture.html nobel lecture (1921)], he said: ''"The special theory of relativity is an adaptation of physical principles to Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics...From Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics it '''takes''' the '''postulate of invariance of the velocity of light''' in a vacuum (light principle).''

Well of course that would make alot more sense. In other words Einstein wasn't referring to Maxwell's original works at all. Fair enough. We all knew all along that Einstein was influenced by Lorentz, and the connection is indeed clear.

It still however leaves a mystery as to what he meant by the Maxwell-Hertz equations in the 27th Sept. Addendum to his 1905 paper.

@David Tombe: Holton (1973, 1988) points out that [[August Föppl]]'s (1894) book on electrodynmics was Einstein's most important source for Maxwell's theory. Föppl presented Maxwell's theory in the formulation of Heaviside and Hertz and discussed the important [[moving magnet and conductor problem]]. Later, other possible sources for (variations) of Maxwell's theory were some papers of Boltzmann, Helmholtz, Drude, Lorentz, Abraham. So there were many different versions of "Maxwell's" theory - at the end Lorentz's formulation was the winner. ;-)  --[[User:D.H|D.H]] ([[User talk:D.H|talk]]) 16:55, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

::The key point here is that Maxwell's original works did not imply that the speed of light is constant. If you look at Maxwell's 1865 paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]] you will see how he derived the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. He specifically dropped the '''v'''X'''H''' term from his electromotive force equation because he was referencing the wave from a fixed point in his dielectric aether. Hence his speed of light was very much on the same lines as the speed of sound. It was based on the density and transverse elasticity of a physical medium.

::In fact, in his 1861 paper, he actually used Newton's equation of the speed of sound to calculate the speed of light. There are links to all of these papers available from some of the wiki articles.

It's only important in so much as Einstein's references to the Maxwell-Hertz equations and their supposed connection with the constancy of the speed of light gives the false impression that Maxwell's equations imply that the speed of light is constant in the relativistic sense.

Maxwell's original equations certainly don't imply anything of the sort. However the constancy of the speed of light might indeed be inferred from the Heaviside versions since Heavisde dropped the '''v'''X'''H''' term and wrote the equations in partial time derivative format. The Heaviside versions are what we get in modern textbooks. If we look at them in isolation, we have equations involving the speed of light that seem to be frame independent, and so one might be forgiven for drawing the conclusion that Maxwell's equations imply the constancy of the speed of light. That might be what Einstein was using. I have read somewhere recently that the Maxwell-Hertz equations is the name that Einstein gave to the Heaviside versions.

At any rate, we wouldn't be able to draw that conclusion about the constancy of the speed of light if we traced back to the origins of the equations. They are based on experiments which took place in the laboratory frame and they originally contained a convective '''v'''X'''H''' term. Heaviside removed the convective '''v'''X'''H''' term which is why nowadays we have to supplemnt Maxwell's equations with the Lorentz force in order to get the '''v'''X'''H''' term.

I would guess that the material that Einstein drew on mostly was Lorentz's material. I'd be very surprised if Einstein hadn't heard about Michelson-Morley. I would say it was probably a combination of watching how Lorentz was struggling with Michelson-Morley, and Einstein's own mis-reading of the Heaviside verisons of Maxwell's equations that lead him to his postulate about the universal constancy of the speed of light.[[User:David Tombe|David Tombe]] ([[User talk:David Tombe|talk]]) 16:18, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

:I don't think there was a "misreading". That the speed of light is constant in all reference frames was a direct consequence of [[Lorentz ether theory]], which was already noted by Poincaré in 1904.

Michael, we need to know what Einstein meant by the Maxwell-Hertz equations. In his 1905 paper, he claims that the Maxwell-Hertz equations imply that the speed of light is a universal constant.

All I know for certain is that Maxwell's original equations as are found in Maxwell's original works, do not imply anything of the sort.

Price]] <sup>[[User talk:MichaelCPrice|talk]]</sup> 14:25, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

I would say that Einstein has totally misinterpreted Maxwell. As regards the electromotive force acting on a body in motion in a magnetic field, Maxwell deals with that at equation (5) in his 1861 paper which is available on-line. The third and fourth terms on the right hand side of this equation are the relevant terms. In the discussion, Maxwell explains this force in terms of centrifugal aether pressure coming from the equatorial plane of his solenoidally aligned molecular vortices.

Interestingly, I was just about to bring up this very point with Ancheta Wis on the talk pages of [[Maxwell's equations]]. Ancheta Wis has told me that Maxwell considered the electric motor to be the greatest invention of the 19th century. Ancheta then went on to tell me that the electric motor works on the principle of the [[Lorentz force]] and not [[Faraday's law]].

In Maxwell's 1861 paper, equation (77) corresponds to the Lorentz force and it contains a '''v'''X'''H''' term. The parts of equation (5) that are relevant to the electric motor is also a '''v'''X'''H''' term. In equation (5), Maxwell attributes '''v'''X'''H''' to centrifugal force. However, in equation (77) it is almost certainly a Coriolis force.

At any rate, the curl of '''v'''X'''H''' leads directly to the convective term in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. Ancheta Wis has simply failed to see how Faraday's law can be extended to cater for electric motors in the zero-curl scenario.

Einstein on the other hand appears to have totally failed to grasp anything that Maxwell said at all. [[User:David Tombe|David Tombe]] ([[User talk:David Tombe|talk]]) 17:00, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

==Notation Issues==

In order of importance:

:* '''replace 4D with 4-space or spacetime''': The use of the term 4D implies that the time dimension has the same properties as spatial dimensions
:* Consider replacing Minkowski imaginary notation with covariant and contravariant notation.  As far as I can tell, without being an expert.  Using imaginary numbers for the time axis is outdated.
:* Consider using the metric with spatial components having the - sign.  I am not an expert on the subject but I think this is the most popular metric and it is pedagogically useful to work toward a common notation.  Personally I prefer this metric because it leads to positive intervals for time-like events.

:I am not aware of any reason why anyone would think that "4D" means anything different than "4-space" or "spacetime". I used "4D" because it makes the titles shorter.
:As far as I know, there is no use of imaginary numbers in the article now.
:I am using -+++ because the spatial components of most tensors are more important and it is better to make them match the non-relativistic values rather than have minus signs or whatever. This signature is used in many references also. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 01:34, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

I didn't mean to be belligerent with my suggestions, I apologize if I came across that way with my quick and blunt suggestions.

I will start with the last comment and work up.

I was only making a suggestion with the choice of +--- over -+++.  It is mostly six dozen of one and half dozen of the other.  It does bother me that there is no consistency.  On wikipedia, for instance this article and [[Lorentz transformation]] use -+++, while [[spacetime]] and [[four-vector]] uses +---.  Changing from 1 to the other involves minus signs popping up in weird places.  

I will confess to a little drive by reviewing, especially with the imaginary number.  When skimming through the article my eye easily caught the one one use of imaginary number (which is after the second equation in the section entitled the geometry of space time) and missed your better discussion earlier.  It is the only time that the word 'imaginary' is used on the page so it should be easy to find if you want to kill it.

As far as the use of the term 4D, it is ambiguous.  You are right that it is used sometimes to signify 3 dimensions of space + 1 of time.  I strongly oppose that because the term is also used for four spatial dimensions such as for [[tesseract]]s.  See [[spacetime]] as well where it discusses 3+1 dimensions.  None of the textbooks I have which discuss relativity, which I admit is small  number including Griffiths, Jackson, and Goldstein, use the term 4D and for that reason, I believe.   It is a small correction, but it makes the article just a little bit stronger.

Looking further I notice as well that this articles uses (t,x,y,z) for the contravariant vector while [[Lorentz transformation]] as well as the other articles cited use, in my experience at least, the more common and dimensionally consistent (ct,x,y,z). 

On a lighter note, I wish someone would decide whether or not to use 4-vector or four-vector, 4-force of four-force (not just for this article but everywhere).  I am ambivalent, but it is kind of irritating to see both being used.

:::Personally, I prefer to use [[SI units]] consistently. This requires that we use (t,x,y,z) rather than (ct,x,y,z) for the position vector. In turn, that requires that we use different units for time components of tensors than for their spatial components. There is a simple rule for doing this as I explained on another talk page:
::::''Actually, the components of a tensor should ''not'' all have the same units. In [[SI units]], time is measured in seconds and distance is measured in meters. Thus the position 4-vector has units of [seconds, meters, meters, meters]. More generally, a factor of (seconds/meter)^(# of contravariant time indices &minus; # of [[covariant]] time indices) must be multiplied by the units of the purely spatial components to get the units of components involving time.''

:::: As far as I can tell, it is the ''modern'' convention to have all four-vectors having the same dimension for both the temporal and their spatial components.  The ''displacement'' 4-vector should not be an exception.  See almost any other article on wikipedia that covers special relativity here for example [[four-vector]] for instance.  Of the all the four-stuff on the [[four-vector]] page only [[four-momentum]] followed your convention.  A quick search of google showed maybe 20% of the pages using your convention and some of those I think are using natural units where the factor of c is absorbed into the unit for time in which case time and space have the same units (inverse MeV if you like).  

::::The problem may be of different fields using different conventions.  All I have to go on are well established books in electricity and magnetism and classical mechanics.  (Griffiths: Introduction to Electrodynamics, third edition and Jackson: Classical Electrodynamics, 2nd edition.  My Goldstein text is at home.)  

::::I am not an expert on relativity, although I do use four-vectors.  This is why I will probably not edit the article even though it is much faster then making the argument on this page.

I guess this is because they use mainly the time variable to differentiate when decomposing the metric, and in some cases, as in deriving the Kasner metric, time is the only argument. Also, their extensive use of synchronous frame may be a factor. Inconvenience is that the metric determinant is negative so they have to write <math>\scriptstyle{\sqrt{-g}}</math> in tensor densities. I am talking about GR, but maybe there can be some more compelling reasons from SR to use +---. I haven't worked enough in SR to say. I think it's more of a preference, as here [http://th-www.if.uj.edu.pl/acta/vol39/pdf/v39p0781.pdf], and it depends on the specific problem at hand. One tends to avoid minus signs as far as possible.

(unindent) As a matter of philosophical principle, the criterion which should guide us in choosing one notational convention over another is &mdash; does it make the job of the practical (experimental) physicist easier or harder? Imagine Alice setting up her laboratory and performing an experiment. She makes notes of the results and publishes a report describing the set-up and results. Bob reads Alice's report and tries to duplicate her work in his laboratory. Our goal in choosing a notation should be to simplify the work of Alice and Bob as much as possible (assuming they follow our notational convention). Since they probably already are used to using SI units and have access to equipment calibrated to them, we should also use SI units. The components of our tensors should (as far as possible) agree with the usual non-relativistic quantities with which they normally work. If discarding the ''myth'' that the components of a tensor must have the same units helps us do this, as it does, then we should discard that myth. Also, introducing extra minus signs should be kept to a minimum which implies (as I see it) that the spatial components of the metric be positive.

That discussion belongs on the working group page I believe since it affects all relativity articles and not just this one.  I will respond to JRSpriggs response about using SI units since this is one of maybe 2 articles that I have seen that use that notation.  
: I agree with you, JRSpriggs, that the SI units are better for experimental work for the most part.  It may even turn out that you convention will dominate in the future the same way that SI units took over E&M despite Jackson's and others best efforts to keep more theorist friendly units.  There are a number of good reasons to not use SI units here, though.  The first and foremost reason is that this is not about philosophy but about speaking the same language.  The standard is to define an x_0 = ct, at least in my experience.  You make an interesting case, but is this article really the place to make a stand on philosophical principles?  (I could be wrong about  x_0 being a defacto standard. A quick google search showed more x_0 = t than I thought would be there, but it wasn't near 50%.)  
: My second point is that while your notation is more experimentalist friendly, the standard notation is more theorist friendly.  It has less constants to accidentally drop for instance.  Correct me if I am wrong but most of the use cases of SR in science are in theory, not experiment.

I also prefer the +--- metric, but I also think that it is not important. What is important is that it is clearly mentioned what conventions we use. I also don't agree with using SI units, that's very unnatural and leads to messy equations. We should simply put c = 1 and use consistent units for space and time. But this isn't really a big deal because you can always pretend that c = 1 even if it isn't the intended interpretation of that equation.

We should not per se define units in a consistent way on wikipedia. That would be an unnecessary burden. People don't benefit from that at all, because if you are unable to make the trivial switch from one set of units to another, you can forget about understanding special relativity and in particular the more technical parts of the theory in which the units actually matter. [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] ([[User talk:Count Iblis|talk]]) 22:17, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

: It is not just about being able to make the trivial switch from one set of units to another vs being able to understand special relativity.  It is about putting an extra burden (small as it is) on someone who is (for now) struggling to understand the content.  A toddler learning to walk might trivially be able to chew gum but forcing him to chew gum while taking his first steps might be more than he can handle.

: I don't think that working toward a common notation is an unnecessary burden.  Certainly being bludgeoned from on high about this issue when so many other more important problems exist is an unnecessary burden.  It is also not worth degenerating into a fight over.  But working toward consensus is how wikipedia works best and a consistent set of units and notation adds a level of professionalism and reduces the burden on new readers.  (And quite frankly it reduces the irritation of certain more experienced but cranky readers who can easily make the switch but don't want to be forced to.)  I have already plugged up this talk page too much with this so I will shut up now.

:: Yikes, I just realized I completely misinterpreted what Count Iblis was saying and refuted what I said earlier.  I thought that the unnecessary burden referred to working toward a common notation for all SR articles.  My response favored working toward everyone using the same units.  I stand by that statement even though it contradicts my belief that we should not use SI units in SR, here.  The more important goal in my opinion is unifying the SR articles.  I will shut up for real, now.

The "As opposed to Newtonian spacetime" at the beginning of point 2 suggests that the remainder of the sentence is false in classical physics. This is wrong. If I'm on board of a moving ship, and I jump up, and I land back on the same part of the floor, the spatial separation between the event "I take off" and the event "I land" is zero in the ship's reference frame, but nonzero in the sea's reference frame; and that would be true even if ''c'' were infinite.

So, Sklar invokes a Neo-Newtonian space-time separate from the Newtonian Space-Time. The Newtonian one is presumably defined relative  to an absolute rest frame, so the counterargument by Army1987 is then not allowed in the Newtonian Space-Time, but but it is allowed in the Neo-Newtonian Space-Time.

== Hyperbole ==
There's a cliche out there to the effect of "Relativity overthrew Newton". Almost universally in commercial, pop science material, its salient feature is that it is sensationalist.

Consider the correspondence principle in quantum mechanics and, in special relativity, the guiding principle that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. We have not abandoned F=ma, nor conservation of momentum, nor equal and opposite, and space is still isotropic and homogeneous. We've have ''extended'' our knowledge. `overthrow` is ''too much''.

== Inconsistent conventions on placement of ''c'' ==

Recent edits by {{user|MichaelCPrice}} appear to be aimed at making section [[Special relativity#Physics in spacetime]] and subsection [[Special relativity#Electromagnetism in 4D]] consistent with some other articles (especially [[Four-vector]]) which follow the convention he prefers concerning the placement of ''c''. This is contrary to the decision which was made in the section "c in the section Special relativity#Physics in spacetime" of [[Talk:Special relativity/Archive 13]]. More to the point, he has (so far) done a incomplete job of changing those sections, so that they are now internally inconsistent. See also the discussions at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Relativity#Agreeing on a consistent metric for SR]] and [[Talk:Stress-energy tensor#Dimension problem.]].

== The sklar quotes are wrong ==


There are two problems with the sklar quote (at least):

* 'well defined': we do know how to make all calculations in space and time for inertial observers; this part of the quote only clouds the issue.

* ''There is simply no such thing as "the distance" between events that are nonsimultaneous'': this is completely, and utterly wrong - the Lorentz Transform is the means by which you can calculate and compare distances between arbitrary events, and for arbitrary inertial observers.
::The term "the distance" is in quotes for a reason - it stands for an antiquated notion (i.e. Galilean invariance and absolute space and time). [[User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]] ([[User talk:Brews ohare|talk]]) 04:54, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

Further, even if you go inside the logic of this mystical, pseudo-science, 
it implies that there is no such thing as distance what so ever! Simultaneity is relative, so two events can not be simultaneous for all observers. 
::I don't follow your implication. Can you spell it out? [[User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]] ([[User talk:Brews ohare|talk]]) 04:54, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

===Comments===
I think you (Brews ohare and Blablablob) are disagreeing more on terminology than on content. For example, as for "well defined space and time": space and time are well-defined for each inertial frame (except in black holes and before the Big Bang, but we're not talking about GR...), and there are well-defined rules for converting them for different frames. But I think Brews by "well-defined" means "defined indipendently of any arbitrary choice", and this is wrong. (But the same thing happens to spatial coordinates in classical physics. The ''y''-component of a vector is only "well-defined" when we choose in which direction the ''y''-axis points. The main difference between SR and Galilean relativity is [[relativity of simultaneity]]. So, while I think its useful to say "SR overthrew absolute time", adding "and space" at the end is not terribly useful, and very confusing. <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600; color: #00F; background-color: #FFF; white-space: nowrap;">[[User:Army1987|A r m y 1 9 8 7 ! ]][[User talk:Army1987|! ]][[Special:Contributions/Army1987|! ]]</span> 09:49, 17 September 2008 (UTC)

== Question on explaining conservation of mass in the context of E = mc^2 ==

In the text a "confusing" tag was placed by someone wondering if we could explain why it is, if energy, mass, and momentum are all separately conserved (in closed systems), how it can be that mass is said to be converted to energy. I have attempted to explain. Einstein's famous m = E/c^2 equation applies to systems only when p = 0 for the system, and thus any system mass decrease is actually invariant mass decrease. We "explain" this by noting that such systems must NOT be closed, if the mass is to decrease! Even in an atomic bomb, the mass decrease only happens because you let invariant mass OUT, as light and heat, and THAT carries away the mass. If you didn't let the bomb cool, the mass would stay the same. If you do let it cool (which of course you always do), the heat transfers the "missing" mass to things it heats up, but THEY gain the mass. [[Invariant mass]] is always conserved, period (or otherwise it wouldn't be invariant). Atomically, the "mass defect" in binding energy also is carried away by kinetic energy and photons, which ultimately carry away the invariant mass. But they have it-- the mass never goes away unless you let it out of your system and lose track of it. It's always somewhere.

:: Precisely. A gigawatt-day is 8.64e13 J, which is close to the 9e13 J represented by a gram of mass. So in the inertial frame of a gigawatt powerplant (nuclear or not-- it's the same for a coalfired plant that large!), the plant sends a gram of electricity out into the world every day. This isn't a gram of electrons! It's a gram of heat, light, and work that comes from the electric field made available by the plant's generators. If you draw your system boundaries around the plant, it loses a gram a day, but the town it powers, gains that gram (not counting escaping light). If you draw your system boundary around the Earth and don't let the streetlight out, no mass is lost or gained, but is (as usual) strictly conserved, even for a powerplant. The same for a bomb. A big thermonuke can make pounds of heat, but if you count objects that absorb the heat, no mass is lost in the system as a whole. <p> Similarly, also not "closed" is the fusion process whereby nucleons get crammed together to make nuclei in [[nucleogenesis]]. And yet that missing mass (packing fraction) is held popularly to have "disappeared" and to represent the binding energy (deficit). Well, it didn't disappear, it's just been removed before you got there, and now is someplace else (back in the remnants of the supernova where the nucleas was created, perhaps) <p> Another popular thing that backs this misconception is that mass-conservation, like all conservation, not only requires a closed system, but also a single observer. If you have a U-235 nucleus split and the parts fly off, it's sometimes said that the two fission products have less mass than the original. Well, as a system, they don't have less mass while they're in flight, '''as seen by the original observer'''. That system of fission products in flight has the same invariant mass it always did. But, you can try to game it by stopping the products (in which case their kinetic energy escapes, and you lose mass that way, because the system isn't closed), OR you can game it by looking at the products in flight one by one, in the rest frame of each of them. But that's summing rest masses, and the reason this is illegal even before they are stopped, is because you have to switch to various inertial frames (those of each of the fission fragments) to get these numbers. So you've gone from one observer at the beginning, to at least 2 different ones at the end. Obviously if mass isn't conserved in THAT process, it's not the fault of Einstein.

:==In Asimov's study of "large numbers" he developed the concept of a "scene" having a value in relation to the importance of it's occurrence in the "spacetime continuum". And in Galalean spacetime and Euclidean Physics this scene value is made up of three independent values of space plus one of time and has lots of possibuilities which he then explored. Please note that our our concepts of motion, and momentum, and kinetic energy and angular momentum all argue that that the increments of dimension and time are independent of each other. Then Lorentz and Einstein came along with the proposition that time is not an independent variable with respect to any dimension, but rather a dependent variable, such that a "scene" of the motion of a ray of light to its ultimate destination is all in the same scene.

::'''Maximum speed limit as a consequence of Gallileo's relativity'''

::[[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] and others have revisted Gallileo's writings on relativity and have found that a maximum speed limit and the acceleration of the [[expansion of the universe]] can be derived from first principles from the idea of relativity of motion and are thus mathematically inevitable. Therefore [[Einstein]]'s postulate that light travels at the same speed relative to all observers is superfluous. Light is merely the first and most obvious phenomenon that achieves the maximum speed that Gallileo's relativity implies, and the expansion of the universe and the accelerating expansion do not require invoking any special mechanism or have anything to do with the distribution of matter.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg20026801.500-why-einstein-was-wrong-about-relativity.html Why Einstein was wrong about relativity], ''New Scientist'', 29th October 2008, issue 2680.</ref><ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1234 The Theory of Relativity - Galileo's Child], Mitchell J.

I had a look at Feigenbaum's paper. I doesn't add anything really new. (We all already know that the parameter c in the Lorentz transformations has, a priori, nothing to do with light.)

Some points I'd like to make about this:
* This work is based on Gallileo's principle of relativity: that the laws of physics look the same to all observers. It is NOT based on Newton's notion of absolute time or the Gallilean transformations.

* Feigenbaum is not the first to suggest that Gallileo could have derived special relativity, but he is the main author that the New Scientist article refers to. It is still true that special relativity can be derived without Einstein's second postulate whether or not you like Feigenbaum's paper. Perhaps other references should be used instead of or as well as Feigenbaum's but the paragraph as a whole should still be included in wikipedia. The section should be renamed '''Maximum speed limit as a consequence of Gallileo's principle of relativity''' to clarify matters.

* Regarding the derivation of the expansion of the universe from first principles I'd like to quote this paragraph from the paper of S. Cacciatori, V. Gorini, and A. Kamenshchik:
"However, following Dyson [12], we are led to observe here that «Minkowski in his 1908 lecture failed to carry his argument to its logical conclusions». Indeed, the argument that guided Minkowski to drop the commutativity of boosts thereby allowing him to interconnect boosts and space rotations into the Lorentz group has left spacetime translations out of the picture. On the other hand, it is only logical that the same argument should be extended to translations, by dropping their commutativity as well. Indeed, it appears that, even at the beginning of the 20th century, astronomers would not have had any a priori compelling reason to believe that the commutativity of translations would not eventually break down provided one would look sufficiently far away in spacetime. The reason why such a possibility did not occur to scientists then is very likely due to the fact that nobody had yet any clear knowledge at that time of the existence of
other galaxies, in the universe, beyond ours. In fact, it was only through his observations with the 100 inch Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, carried out during the years 1923 and 1924, that Hubble was able to establish beyond doubt that most of the nebulae, earlier observed with less powerful telescopes and thought to belong to the Milky Way, were not part of our galaxy, being instead themselves galaxies in their own right, beyond our own. Therefore, since the picture one had of the universe at the time of Minkowski was that of an island galaxy immersed in an otherwise infinite void, the idea of non commuting space and time translations would have indeed appeared quite unnatural to everybody, Minkowski himself included. Nevertheless, it is perhaps a bit surprising that no «act of audacity on the part of higher mathematics » arose suggesting that translations were not, after all, commutative. In the words of Dyson [12], an opportunity was missed by Minkowski and by his fellow mathematicians. Had someone made the further daring leap of renouncing the commutativity of translations, a quite logical step after the commutativity of boosts had been abandoned, and acknowledged that Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations should not «lead their lives entirely apart» but be instead interconnected, one would have realized that the true kinematical group of nature is not the Poincaré group P(c) but the de Sitter group dS(c; �), � being an unspecified “cosmological constant” to be determined by observation [13]."

(unindent) To Delaszk: Both "mangled" and "warped" are derogatory terms. The preferred term is "curved", but even that applies only to general relativity where one has gravity. In special relativity, spacetime is flat (see [[Minkowski space]]). And Minkowski space is actually simpler in structure than the 3+1 dimensional structure of Galilean-Newtonian space+time. What you fail to understand is that "supporting" relativity by making false claims for it, is actually opposing it by making it seem self-contradictory and incomprehensible by ordinary people. Lies undermine the truth even (and especially) if they are made to seem favorable. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 13:33, 1 November 2008 (UTC)

:I am going to back off from this discussion and from making any further edits to the relativity articles since I do not have the knowledge to pursue this, but Feigenbaum's paper says in the opening paragraph "It is my purpose here to show precisely that in these seminal concepts of Galileo lies the special theory of relativity with no further additional physical insight or knowledge.".

::::::I don't agree that it is an illusion. We may be talking at cross-purposes here. The first thing to say is that K is a finite constant. Whether K is zero or not depends on whether delta in the numerator is either always zero or always nonzero (we are excluding the case v=0). So accepting a necessary max-speed depends on showing that delta must be nonzero. So now we come to the central point of all this: if you consider a frame of reference which is rotated with respect to another then you must have nonzero delta in the transform matrix.  Since the expression <math>\frac{\delta(v)}{v\gamma(v)}</math> is a constant then the existence of any nonzero delta forces every delta to be nonzero. Allowing any rotation implies everything is a rotation. This is not compatible in any with Galilean-Newtonian kinematics which does not consider the possibility of frames of reference being rotated with respect to one another. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 08:45, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

:::::::Galilean-Newtonian kinematics has no problem dealing with frames of reference that are rotated (by constant Euler angles) with respect to each other. That's why we have conservation of angular momentum in classical mechanics. If you want a systematic treatment, take a look at [http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0602018 math-ph/0602018]. The difference you're talking about here is that, for the Lorentz group, a succession of boosts can be the same as a rotation. But the fact remains that you still need some further input beyond the relativity principle to arrive at the Lorentz transformations instead of the Galilei transformations. Which further input you choose (boosts able to generate a rotation, finite maximal speed, constancy of light speed) doesn't make much of a difference, but there must be ''some'' additional input.

::::::::::You don't need to go further than Feigenbaum's [http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1234 abstract], where he clearly states that, from relativity, he can obtain the Lorentz transformations "with a parameter 1/c&sup2;, some undetermined, universal constant of nature" - no mention that his parameter somehow must be non-zero.  The main text reaches this question on page 23, where Feigenbaum writes explicitly: "there can be no conceptual way to decide the value of 1/c&sup2;" – and then goes on to explore ways of fixing the parameter by reference to experiment. Which is fine – as I said before, there are different ways of getting that extra information. But the point is that you ''do'' need extra information, and Feigenbaum is very clear about that. [[User:Markus Poessel|Markus Poessel]] ([[User talk:Markus Poessel|talk]]) 18:03, 7 November 2008 (UTC)
:::::::::::I think the point is that the relevance of the second postulate to the universe we live in has to be confirmed by experiment anyway, so why bother making the postulate in the first place.

[[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 19:12, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

(Un-indenting.) To be sure, the principle of relativity should also be subject to experimental tests. In particular the mechanical part of it used to derive special relativity up to the value of 1/c&sup2; (beyond that, the relativity principle is more of a general program than a specific postulate - it's something that's supposed to hold for all physical laws, even the ones you haven't discovered yet). But it's important to state that Galilean relativity isn't sufficient to fix the Lorentz transformations on its own. You need something more, either an additional postulate (to be tested experimentally like all other postulates) or a free parameter (to be fixed experimentally). And that, again, is not a new result. And it's why  is rather misleadingly named. What you call that additional ingredient is a rather minor point, but you shouldn't make people think there isn't an additional ingredient. That said, it looks to me that [[Special relativity via single postulate]] is pretty much a POV split. You didn't agree with what was written in [[special relativity]], so you started another article devoted to the statements that were deleted from the main article. That's not how it should go. The information that you can get most of the structure of the theory from the relativity principle should really go into the main article. [[User:Markus Poessel|Markus Poessel]] ([[User talk:Markus Poessel|talk]]) 21:09, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

:Consider two approaches:

:*1) Formulation of special relativity based on: principle of relativity + universal lightspeed
:*2) Derivation of lorentz transformations up to a free parameter.

:The first approach produces a theory with a free parameter c to be determined by experiment.

:The second approach produces a theory with a free parameter -1/c^2 to be determined by experiment.

:When the values of the free parameters are fixed by experimental measurements then the two approaches produce the same theory. So special relativity ''can'' be developed without extra information. 

:The usefulness of the second postulate is that it makes it explicit from the start what the conclusion is going to be. It gives a shortcut to deriving the Lorentz transformations. Postulating universal lightspeed is a public relations exercise so that educationally it makes relativity easier to understand. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 08:50, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

::Where to start? The usual approach 1) doesn't have c as a free parameter. It explicitly says that c is the same c as in Maxwell's equations, and thus essentially fixed before you even begin to derive the consequences of your postulates. 

::Secondly, what is the experimental input from the measurement (in particular the crucial bit, the one that says 1/c&sup2; isn't infinite) other than "extra information" that goes beyond the principle of relativity?

::Also, postulating a universal speed of light is not a "public relations exercise". It's the way all this was historically developed. Einstein's starting point (certainly in his original article) was the combination of Maxwell's equations with the principle of relativity. Also, don't forget that you need to define some standard coordinates with the usual definition of simultaneity before you get the Lorentz transformations in their usual form. There are other ways of doing that ("standard cannons" that fire particles - and you need isotropy), but light is certainly a convenient choice. [[User:Markus Poessel|Markus Poessel]] ([[User talk:Markus Poessel|talk]]) 13:37, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

:::To be specific, the value of c depends via Maxwell on the value of the [[permittivity of free space]]. Theory does not specify the value of the permittivity. So we have:
:::*Original approach results in the theory up to the free parameter pair: c and permittivity.
:::*Feigenbaum's approach results in the theory up to free parameter -1/c^2.
:::In both cases you must determine the numerical value of the free parameters by experiment, and when you have done so you end up with the same theory. The only difference is that the Feigenbaum's approach doesn't use the second main postulate, so compared to the original two-postulate formulation it can be described as a single-postulate formulation.

:::I agree that the first approach was the way it was historically developed. The wikipedia article is accurately reflecting the way it was originally formulated. I think that the effect of Einstein's second postulate was that it helped to familiarise people with the theory. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 15:44, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

::::Again, where to begin? The original approach doesn't have any free parameters, in the sense of parameters that still need to be determined. It explicitly postulates that a previously known constant (the speed of light) plays a previously unsuspected role for kinematics and mechanics. That's different from deriving the Lorentz transformations from mechanical relativity, without any indication of what the parameter 1/c&sup2; is.
::::If you want to be precise, you would need to call the two varieties the "two-postulate" and the "one-postulate-one-experiment" formulation.
::::I still have no idea what you mean by "helped to familiarise people with the theory". It's not as if, in 1905, there were different versions, and the one with the constancy-of-light-speed was somehow easier understandable, or more popular, and "won out" for that reason. 
::::But let's go back to what's Wikipedia-relevant. I still don't think there's any course of action other than getting rid of that POV-fork-like article of yours, and adding a sentence about what can be deduced from the relativity principle alone to the main article. [[User:Markus Poessel|Markus Poessel]] ([[User talk:Markus Poessel|talk]]) 18:26, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

:::::In the original formulation you don't know the value of c until you do an experiment. In the other approach you likewise don't know the value of c. When the experiments are done the resulting theories are the same. There is no point in calling it "one-postulate-one-experiment" unless you also call the original the "two-postulate-one-experiment". 
:::::The remark about familiarisation is that it is a good thing that Einstein came up with the second postulate because if he had derived the Lorentz transformations using some other approach it would have been less immediately clear what the theory said and perhaps taken longer for people to accept it. Anyway there ''have'' been various formulations over the years and Einstein's ''has'' won out as it is still the one people refer to.
:::::The single-postulate point of view is a notable POV and in my view deserves more than a sentence. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 19:10, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

::::::There are, in fact, more postulates involved. The existence of inertial frames is one. Then there are the different formulations of the usual two postulates. Do you count "Maxwell's theory obeys the relativity principle" as a new postulate? If your "one postulate" is only kinematical/mechanical relativity, do you need an additional postulate to get relativistic electrodynamics? There are people who've written more systematic books that split special relativity into independent axioms, starting with events, postulating the existence of free particles, postulating isotropy and so on (showing that they're independent is quite a feat, btw!). Given the different levels of rigorosity, and the different ways of formulating things, there are many different "numbers of postulates" you can assign to special relativity. Which, I think, shows that the "number of postulates" isn't all that interesting from a physics point of view. The interesting bit is what you can derive from mechanical relativity alone, namely more than people think, but yes, I think that merits no more than one or two sentences in the overall special relativity article. And some sentences under "relativity principle", perhaps. [[User:Markus Poessel|Markus Poessel]] ([[User talk:Markus Poessel|talk]]) 22:22, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

:::::::The article now includes the phrase "claim may be misleading because actually these formulations rely on various unsaid assumptions such as isotropy and homogeneity of space.

Also, some statements in that article are still rather odd. Why call it "Feigenbaum's derivation" when it's been done long before (and I've given you the references)? And the "bizarre rotations", as far as I can see, are a standard and certainly not bizarre part of the Lorentz group, which also has been known for pretty much a century.

Both derivations are only heuristic arguments. What is missing in this article is a real derivation of the equations for relativistic energy and momentum.

You made the computations unnecessarily complicated, you know that dv/dt*dt=dv, right? So, it is not necssary to carry those t_0 and t_1 limits with you around, nor is it necessary to integrate wrt t, you can integrate wrt v. Working in v parameter instead of t would had enabled you to drastically reduce the number of steps. Using total differentials instead of derivatives further reduces the number of steps. Compare your derivation to mine. :-)

We can also do a partial integration, similar to DS1000's original derivation in the second step.

<math>\frac{d}{dt}(\gamma m\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{v} =
\frac{d}{dt}(\gamma m\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}) - (\gamma m\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{\frac{dv}{dt}}</math>

Then when integrating the second term over time you write it as the integral over v of 1/2 m gamma(v) d(v^2), you don't expand
1/2 dv^2 as v dv, because gamma(v) is actually a function of v^2, so it is the same as integrating a term 1/sqrt(1-x/c^2) over x. [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] ([[User talk:Count Iblis|talk]]) 02:29, 2 November 2008 (UTC)

== Propose removal of paragraph about application to cyclotrons in subsection on Kinetic energy ==

Although I still strongly think that the original "derivation" of kinetic energy, building on the preceding subsection on force, was much more suited ''in its original context'', the current new derivation is healthy. Of course it does remain a showcase of elementary calculus and algebra, but if that is what we need in an article ''about special relativity'', then there's no point in my trying to remove it against what seems to have become some sort of consensus.

On the other hand, the part about the ''immediate application of the above in cyclotrons'', a nice derivation it may be, but I really think this '''does not belong here'''. It is [[wp:source|unsourced]], it looks like  [[wp:or|original research]] or at best as a well worked out text book exercise, and i.m.o. most important, it does not provide any ''added value to the main article''. Perhaps, without the reproduction of the entire derivation, it belongs in the [[cyclotron|cyclotrons]] article. Remember that [[Special relativity#Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] is just a subsection.

:*Uniform circular motion has acceleration '''without''' a component parallel to the existing velocity.
:*Furthermore you say that "''Acceleration requires a component ... in the direction of the acceleration''". That's like saying that a vector has a component in its own direction. Duh.

::Well then, let me quote the reference. First of all, relativistic momentum '''P''' is given by: <math> \mathbf{P} = \frac{m\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}</math> and Newton's second law is: <math> \mathbf{F} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p} \over \mathrm{d}t}</math>. Now, at the top of Page 80 of ''"Introducing Special Relativity" by W.S.C.Williams, published by Taylor and Francis'' it says: "However, the factor <math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}</math> present in the formula for '''P''', leads to a situation in which an acceleration generally needs a force with a component parallel to v in addition to that in the direction of the acceleration."

== Delaszk's statement ==

I have edited Delaszk's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special_relativity&diff=prev&oldid=250633797 statement]
:"''By using the same units to measure both space and time (e.g. the metre), then speed becomes a dimensionless quantity (e.g. metre per metre). By the principle of relativity, equations with similar form to the Lorentz transformations are derived. Maxwell's Equations then fix the numerical value of the speed of light in these units to be the dimensionless number 1. This can be thought of as saying: a time of 1 metre is the time it takes for light to travel one metre. See [[Special relativity via single postulate]].''"
into
:"''By using the same units to measure both space and time (e.g. the metre), speed becomes a dimensionless quantity (e.g. metre per metre) and the value of the speed of light in these units becomes the dimensionless number 1.''"
for the following reasons:
# "''By using ..., then speed becomes...''" is grammatically wrong. The word "''then''" should not be there.
# The phrase "''By the principle of relativity, equations with similar form to the Lorentz transformations are derived.''" doesn't make sense. And "''with similar form to''" is grammatically wrong.
# The phrase "''Maxwell's Equations then fix...''": Either the postulate of constant lightspeed, or experiment, ''combined with'' the definition of speed and the choise of the units fixes the number 1 for the speed of light.
# The phrase "''This can be thought of as saying that...''" is trivially obvious.
# Delaszk's (private) project [[Special relativity via single postulate]] is not related to the units of speeds.

The whole paragraph is basically an introduction to the article [[Special relativity via single postulate]] which I think deserves a link from the main article. Perhaps you disagree that it deserves a link or that the link should be in the Status section. But as a summary of that article the paragraph is as accurate as I could make it. 
*[[Special relativity via single postulate]] is not a private project. Anyone is free to edit any wikipedia article. Anyone who has read any literature which discusses the single postulate issue will be able to usefully edit that page.
*One of the main references about the single postulate approach is the Hsu&Hsu book and they make the definition of units central to their thesis. So the article is related to units of speed. 
* The phrase "''This can be thought of as saying that...''" may be trivially obvious to you, but it was not obvious to me until I read it in the book, and I think it usefully explains in words what the situation is.
*The references in the article [[Special relativity via single postulate]] do not postulate the constant lightspeed. The Hsu&Hsu book does however derive transformations from the relativity principle which are equivalent to the Lorentz but with a maximal speed of 1. Combining this with Maxwell's equations then shows that light travels at this maximal speed.
*There may be some issues with grammar which I happily accept can be improved. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 12:48, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

==Taiji relativity==

To respond in full to the above section, I'd like to clarify a point here about units of time and speed. In Hsu&Hsu's taji relativity formulation, all 4 coordinates of spacetime are measured in the same units. The transformations are then derived using just the principle of relativity and have a maximal speed of 1, which is quite unlike the derivation of the Lorentz transformations in which the parameter may still be zero. So this is not the same as other "single postulate" derivations. However the relationship of taiji time "w" to standard time "t" must still be found, otherwise it would not be clear how an observer would measure taiji time. The taiji transformations are then combined with Maxwell's equations to show that the speed of light is independent of the observer and has the value 1 in taiji speed. Since we can measure the speed of light by experiment in m/s to get the value c, we can use this as a conversion factor. i.e. we have now found an operational definition of taiji time: w=ct.

::::Inverse mass can also be measured in the same units as length by interpreting Planck's constant as a dimensionless conversion factor. And if put G = 1, then mass itself is dimensionally the same as a length, everything has become dimensionless.

::::You can regain dimensions and units even if all quantities are dimensionless. You can redefine physical quantities by introducing arbitrary dimensionless rescaling parameters and rewrite the theory in terms of these rescaled variables only. At this stage everything is still dimensionless. But then you consider the singular limit in which some rescaling parameters become zero or infinite. In this singular limit the connection between some variables gets lost.

::::If in this theory intelligent beings subjectively experience the extremely rescaled physical variables, then the laws of physics they discover will reflect that. So, they will formulate their laws of physics using incompatible physical quantities by assigning incompatible dimensions to the variables. Only much later will they discover the existence of the very small or very large "conversion factors". But by that time, the perception that the different appeantly incompatible physical quantities are actually incompatible is so much part of their culture that they'll not overturn this. They'll assign dimensions to the rescaling constants to make the conversion "dimensionally correct", rather than abolish the dimensions altogether.

== Lorentz transformation without second postulate ==

It seems there is a lot of discussion about single-postulate derivations of special relativity ;-). For some historical informations, see: [[History of special relativity#Spacetime physics]]. And look into the section "Lorentz transformation without second postulate" for the approaches of Ignatowski and Frank/Rothe. However, according to Pauli (1921), Resnick (1967), and Miller (1981), those models were insufficient.... --[[User:D.H|D.H]] ([[User talk:D.H|talk]]) 09:57, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

:That section includes the phrase "Ignatowski was forced to recourse to electrodynamics to include the speed of light.". Exactly, the trio of "principle of relativity+Maxwell+numerical values from experiment" gives special relativity and this should be compared with "principle of relativity+second postulate+Maxwell+numerical values from experiment". Since Einstein's 1905 paper is all about electrodynamics he is assuming Maxwell's equations, and the theory isn't practically applicable without numerical values. When compared like with like, from the point of view of asking what is knowable, the second postulate can be deduced. If you restrict your attention to just the standalone theory of relativity then yes you need the postulate. But given all the available knowledge we don't need to postulate it. In other words different domains of knowledge are overlapping and thus taken together have more information than necessary.

::::::This argument is about what it is possible to derive. Einstein derived the Lorentz from the assumption about light. However the finite maximal speed can be deduced without assuming anything about light. From group postulates the only consistent choices are either the Galilean or Lorentz. But measuring the addition of velocities of two particles shows Galilean transformations do not match actual results, then the only other set of transformations consistent with the PoR, isotropy etc are the Lorentz transformations. If it turns out that the photon has mass that would affect a lot of physics but it would not ruin special relativity because the existence of the maximal speed is not dependent on the constancy of light. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 10:05, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

There is absolutely no doubt about it that Einstein derived special relativity on the basis of the constancy of the speed of light, and that without such a postulate, the special theory of relativity would fall. There is however some argument surrounding how Einstein stumbled upon the concept that speed of light is a universal constant. He himself claims that it is implicit in the Maxwell-Hertz equations. This was discussed here on an earlier thread, and one editor supplied the source in question. That source was not however Maxwell's original papers. Maxwell himself never said anything about the speed of light being constant. [[User:David Tombe|David Tombe]] ([[User talk:David Tombe|talk]]) 12:43, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

:This argument is not about what Einstein did or did not do. It's about what is possible. The Lorentz transformations can be derived before making any prior assumptions about light. For one thing, time dilation shows that the Galilean transformations don't fit experimental results. The theory of special relativity would ''not'' fall if light wasn't constant. If the speed of light was very close to the maximal speed this would still give the impression that it was constant. It would mean that Maxwell's equations weren't accurate. I'm not suggesting light isn't constant but if it weren't it would not mean the fall of special relativity. [[User:Delaszk|Delaszk]] ([[User talk:Delaszk|talk]]) 14:31, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

We'll have to agree to differ on that. The entire derivation of the special theory is based on the universal constancy of the speed of light. It is based on the fact that light doesn't obey the Galilean vector addition of velocities. Once we take that fact away, we can no longer derive the theory.

::As much as I disagree with much of what Delaszk has written, in this particular instance, he is correct. You can derive the core of special relativity - the Lorentz transformations and all that follows from them - from the principle of relativity as it applies to the way that different inertial observers relate their observations to each other, plus the assumption that there is a maximal speed. You don't need to talk about light. The argument works just as well in a universe where there are no electromagnetic fields.

:::I would further add that "the assumption that there is a maximal speed" is not really an assumption but hinges simply on determining a numerical value for the constant 1/c^2.

There seems to be some kind of dispute on this page over the question of applying special relativity to non-inertial frames.

::Also the The book "A Broader View of Relativity" by Hsu and Hsu repeatedly says that the speed of light as measured by an observer in a non-inertial frame is not constant.

::The Lorentz transformations of SR do not apply to non-inertial frames whether the acceleration is uniform or not. According to the book - In 1943, Moller obtained a transform between an inertial frame and a frame moving with constant acceleration, based on Einstein's vacuum eq and a certain postulated time-independent metric tensor, although this transform is of limited applicabilty as it does not reduce to the Lorentz transform when a=0. Anyway this relies on extra postulates and so cannot be strictly called SR.

::The book describes attempts throughout the 20th century to generalize the Lorentz transformations from inertial frames to non-inertial frames with uniform acceleration. It says these efforts failed to produce satisfactory results that are both consistent with 4-dimensional symmetry and smoothly reduce to the Lorentz transformations in the limit as accl tends to zero. The authors then claim that they have finally come up with suitable transformations for constant linear acceleration (uniform acceleration). They call these transformations: Generalized Moller-Wu-Lee Transformations.

I changed the sentence about aceleration. The problem is that you cannot derive from the postulates of special relativity that an acceleration will not have a non-trivial effect. E.g. in case of the twin paradox, we know that you can compute the correct answer of the age difference of the twins simply by integrating the formula for time dilation along the trajectory of the travelling twin. This means that one assumes that at any instant, the twin on its trajectory can be replaced by an inertial observer that is moving at the same velocity of the twin. This gives the correct answer, as long as we are computing effects that are local to the travelling twin.

The fact that the acceleration that distinguishes the local inertial rest frame of the twin and the true frame of the twin does not have any additional effect follows from general relativity (it has, of course, been verified eperimentally).

Note that the discusion of the twin paradox on its own wiki page involves a twin undergoing an infinite acceleration from moving away from the Earth at a uniform velocity to toward the earth at a unifirm velocity. Then, the acceleration does cause an effect, but that's simply due the fact that you have to change inertial frames.

I rather think there is '''confusion between''' (1) why the theory is called special, and (2) what SR includes. In the former case a principle is applied to frames. In the latter a theory is applied to physical situations. Even if ''a principle is applied to a special kind of frames only, the resulting ''theory can still be applied'' in other frames.
And I have [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special_relativity&diff=269148148&oldid=269108541 removed] the bizarre phrase "''... or acceleration is constant with time and uniform in space.''" again. - [[User:DVdm|DVdm]] ([[User talk:DVdm|talk]]) 16:49, 7 February 2009 (UTC)

The terms special and general relativity are derived from the principles of special and general covariance which give guidelines for the form of the laws of physics for tensor fields.  The principle of special covariance implies the invariance of these tensor fields under isometric coordinate trasformations which is a special group of transformations as compared to general coordinate transformations.

== Mass–energy equivalence ==

The last paragraph in this section is wrong on a number of points.  This paragraph if fixed does not supply any new information that is not contained elsewhere therefore I suggest it just be deleted.  First of all, there is no such thing as conservation of invariant mass, only conservation of energy.  The easiest counterexample is the annihilation of matter and antimatter since the resultant photons do not have rest mass.  Also, there is nothing wrong with saying that matter and energy are convertible as is the case in matter/antimatter annihilation.

Somebody please fix this!

:I agree.  But I have a more radical suggestion.  Delete 99% of the whole section, which is just meant to be a resume of the the article [[Mass–energy equivalence]]. --[[User:MichaelCPrice|Michael C. Price]] <sup>[[User talk:MichaelCPrice|talk]]</sup> 00:58, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Especially sign your posts if you're wrong, which you are! Invariant mass, relativistic mass, energy, and momentum are all separately conserved in closed systems for single observers, in SR. Invariant mass is of course conserved in closed systems, and a pair of photons (so long as they aren't moving in precisely the same direction) has an invariant mass. In fact the two 511 kev photons from an electron-positron anihiliation AS A SYSTEM have an invariant mass, and it is 1.022 MeV-- the same as that of a system of a motionless electron and positron. As expected, since the anihilation conserves mass, energy and momentum. Yes, each photon has no rest mass as a separate object, but nobody claimed that the mass of a system can be calculated by adding up rest masses of its parts. That isn't ''even'' true for a system of moving massive objects (a container of hot gas) and it's not true for a container of photons, either. Photons add mass to systems, even if they don't have it themselves. It's all there in  '''m<sup>2</sup> = E<sup>2</sup> - p<sup>2</sup>'''. Apply this to a single photon and E = p, thus m= zero. Apply it to two photons going in opposite directions and p=zero and thus m=E. The system has mass! <p> As to whether or not the section should be condensed and summarized and redirected to mass-energy equivalence, it was expanded at the request of somebody who wanted a further explanation. Since the explanation as contained and carefully laid out is not understood by at least one reader (see above), perhaps it should be mostly left. I will leave it to others to explain how the invariant mass of systems is conserved via the energy-momentum equation, if you condense this.

:::The unsigned poster is not wrong.  For example, a statement such as ''Thus, the invariant mass of systems of particles is a calculated constant for all observers'' is highly misleading.  1st, I have no idea what the merit of "calculated" is here; 2nd, invariant mass is invariant under a Lorentz transformation but is not a constant with time (as the annihilation example shows) which is implied.

:::: "Calculated" was put in because invariant mass cannot be directly ''measured'' in many systems. In a bound system you simply weigh or measure the mass or something. But the concept also applies to unbound systems, and then it must be calculated. Yes, it's invariant, which means the same for all observers. And it's conserved in closed systems. Which means constant over time. The annihilation example shows this quite well. Mass of electron and positron is M before annihilation, and after annihilation, invariant mass of the system of two photons flying in opposite directions, is '''STILL''' M. If you disagree, let's see your math. (But I already put everything you need just above).

:::::Explanation accepted.  But the problem with the article is that it uses the term "mass" loosely.  Sometimes it means "rest mass", other times it means "relativistic mass".  "Invariant mass" is the catch-all, but that is often sloppily just called "mass". --[[User:MichaelCPrice|Michael C. Price]] <sup>[[User talk:MichaelCPrice|talk]]</sup> 00:40, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
:::::: Yes, there's a whole [[Mass in special relativity]] article due to these confusions. But all three types of mass are conserved in closed systems over time (in a given frame, which means for a single observer), so there's never any "conversion" of energy to mass, and mass never "disappears"-- unless you "let it out" ! The "conversion of mass to energy" is a popular misconception, which I've tried to kill, but it's a hydra. I don't know of very many wrong physics "facts" which are taught so widely. Sigh. <p> As to the types of mass, relativistic mass is just total energy/c^2, so most people prefer total energy. It's obviously conserved. Rest mass is the same as invariant mass for single particles so the concept is easy. Invariant mass is the generalization of the "rest mass" idea to systems of moving particles. Again it's easy if the system is bound: it's just the system mass in the COM frame, where you could "weigh" it (like a container of hot gas). It's the rest mass of a bound system which has parts not at rest. It's conserved, obviously: the weight stays the same so long as you don't let any energy or mass out (I use the example of a nuclear bomb in a really strong box on a scale: blow it up and no change in weight. But it's very much hotter in the box). Only for unbound systems is "invariant mass" something "non-physical" and not something that isn't directly associated with common experience.

:::::::I share you angst over the mass - energy "conversion" misconception, but it's going to take a long, long time before people forget E=Mc^2.  I assume you meant to say that "rest mass" ''isn't'' conserved, whilst "relativistic mass" and "invariant mass" are, since rest mass'' does'' vanish in (say) electron-positron annihilation whilst invariant and total relativistic mass (effectively total energy) don't change.--[[User:MichaelCPrice|Michael C. Price]] <sup>[[User talk:MichaelCPrice|talk]]</sup> 02:32, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
:::::::: Rest mass of closed systems doesn't vanish so long as you keep one observer through the process. The rest mass of systems is called invariant mass. Since places where "rest mass" is said to disappear always end up being systems (either at both start or finish, or at least at the finish), it's more or less true that rest mass is conserved also-- at least in bound systems where "rest" has a physical meaning. Example, a single {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}} ('''π<sup>0</sup>''') has a rest mass. When it decays to two photons, neither has a rest mass, but the two photon system has an invariant mass, and if you trap it in a bottle (photons bouncing around), a "rest mass" also (it would add weight to a container on scales). This system rest mass is conserved for any observer who starts out at the beginning of the reaction and follows it over time. <p> Now, it is true that the sum of rest masses of things in a system isn't conserved ("rest mass" as measured by many observers, each at rest with the things in question, and reporting zero when they can't do it). But you can't measure the individual rest masses without changing frames multiple times, so this violates the "single frame" or "single observer" rule. There's no reason why the sums of rest masses that many observers measure, SHOULD be conserved. Conservation laws may allow any observer from start-to-finish of a process, but they don't allow you to change observers ''while the process is underway'', or otherwise many conservation laws would not work! (only invariant ones would remain-- but conservation of energy and momentum as separate entities would have to go). <p> As for E = mc^2, when written like that it only means that energy HAS mass (and vice versa). When it's written ΔE = Δm c^2 it means that somebody let some energy or mass out of the control volume, and thus the other went with it (usually energy is let out, and mass inside is now found to be smaller, as is the case when binding energy is released). It doesn't mean m was converted to E! The E let out took the m with it!

:::::::::Our disagreement is only over definitions and phraseology.  I would say that the "rest mass" of a collection of particles is simply the sum of their rest masses.  Not conserved with time and different observers may disagree since they may not agree about the number of particles present at a particular time.  Better to reserve the term "invariant mass" for the conserved quantity.

:::::::::: Well, I don't know what the term "rest mass" of an unbound system of particles would be. However, the rest mass of a bound system doesn't agree with your definition, since it's defined as what mass we measure when the system is at rest (not necessarily the particles). So there's a rest mass of a proton or a C-12 atom, both of which are composites (collections of particles). And these rest masses by measurement are not the sum of rest masses of their components. This ''is'' the system invariant mass when defined that way (system mass when system p=0). So it has the virtue of being invariant and (of course) conserved. We have the need to talk of the rest masses of bound systems, because those are usually the masses that we're measuring. What else would we call them? Would you suggest that we cannot use "rest mass" as a term for the mass we measure for hadrons and atoms and baseballs and such?

== Relativistic Speeds Linking To SR ==

Whenever I click a link talking about relativistic speeds, it always links to the special relativity page.

A discussion of a [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/rocket.html relativistic rocket] accelerating past a line of evenly spaced stationary synchronized clocks would be an obvious way to lead into general relativity without getting too technical. Since, from the point of view of the rocket, the clocks are becoming more and more out of sych, while at the same time  the entire line is shrinking and  moving past the rocket, there is a point behind the rocket where the clocks 'pile up' and time slows to a halt. A kind of 'black hole'. I know of no simpler way of explaining the principles of special or general relativity.

== Wrong citation of postulate ==

Starting with a reminder, Einstein's second postulate is as follows (both his formulations):

*"light is always* propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body" 
(*stets = every time; omitted in the other translation)

*"Any ray of light moves in the "stationary" system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body"

This light principle is "apparently irreconcilable" with the Principle of Relativity. Halfway in his derivations from these postulates, Einstein states: 

"We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving system, is propagated with the velocity c, if, as we have assumed, this is the case in the stationary system; for we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity.".

That makes sense as his light postulate does not pretend that light is propagated with the same velocity c in more than one system. Now, check that with the rendering in this article:

''The Principle of'' '''Invariant''' ''Light Speed – Light in vacuum propagates with the speed c (a fixed constant) in terms of'' '''any''' ''system of inertial coordinates, regardless of the state of motion of the light source.'' (emphasis mine)

Do I need to point out that this article both wrongly describes and wrongly cites the second postulate? Note also that it does '''not''' make sense to prove a postulate. And who of you pretends that a "principle of invariant light speed" is "apparently irreconcilable" with the Principle of Relativity?!

Moreover, the theory concerns "the electrodynamics of moving bodies '''based on Maxwell's theory for stationary bodies''' ". I wonder if anyone else recognizes Maxwell's theory in either of Wikipedia's postulates.

Apparently it is a widespread error as it is also mentioned in the literature, see for example
http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/3/381 :

"It is still perhaps not widely appreciated that in 1905 Einstein used his postulate concerning the ‘constancy’ of the light-speed in the ‘resting’ frame, in conjunction with the principle of relativity, to ''derive'' numerical light-speed invariance".

Am I really the only one who noticed that the wrong citation produced a big misrepresentation?

== Undid changes to section on time dilation and length contraction ==

I have reverted StradivariusTV's edits to the section for the following reasons:
* The opening sentence is entirely wrong:
::"''Consider two events ''A'' and ''B'' which occur at rest in a certain reference frame ''S''. Special relativity predicts that the time difference between ''A'' and ''B'' as measured in another reference frame ''S′'' will be greater than that measured in ''S''—an effect known as ''time dilation''. Additionally, the distance between ''A'' and ''B'' as measured in ''S′'' will be less than that measured in ''S''; this is known as ''length contraction''.''"
:::Remarks:
:::*Events do not "''occur at rest in some frame''". Events just occur.
:::*Special relativity predicts that the time difference between two '''colocal''' events (i.e. occurring '''at the same place''' in some frame S), as measured in another reference frame S' will be greater than that measured in S.
:::*The above statement requires two events '''at the same place''' in frame S (i.e. '''Dx = 0'''), and therefore the distance between these events is zero, so these events cannot be used in the classical example of length contraction. The statement on length contraction requiring simultaneity in S' ('''Dt' = 0''') would be reduced to the trivial '''0 = 0'''. In fact, every quantity would be zero: Dx = Dx' = Dt = Dt' = 0. We wouldn't even have two distinct events ''A'' and ''B''.
:::In short, there is no way you can use ''one'' single pair of events to explain ''both'' the standard time dilation ''and'' length contraction examples ''in one swoop''.
* The original explanation provided an operational view, i.e. it worked with physical clocks and rods and it took great care to separate the pairs of events needed to apply the Lorentz transformation.

:: I'm the guy who made the edit (different IP, yes). I apologise about the anonymity, but I'm rather reluctant about such account (for personal reasons). Yes, I've been rather [[wp:BOLD]]. Now, I'm not particular about letting my edit as it was written stand, but about making the article better.

:: Let's summarise the changes I've made. I've rewrote (rather, paraphrased) the intro; reorganised the material into kinematics (Minkowski space, Lorentz transform, etc.), dynamics (momenta, Minkowski force, etc.), electrodynamics (Maxwell in covariant notation), and status (history, domain of validity, experiments), and cut out some material into [[Consequences of Special Relativity]].

:: Now, I agree that [[Consequences of Special Relativity]] is very badly organized. I would be for removing/reorganizing the material somehow. I was not responsible for creating it; I just removed the material there because I didn't see anywhere better for it to be there.

:: The article as it stood before my edit was ''very'' haphazard:
:::# Postulates
:::# Lack of an absolute reference frame
:::# Consequences
:::# Reference frames, coordinates and the Lorentz transformation
:::# Simultaneity
:::# Time dilation and length contraction
:::# Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light
:::# Composition of velocities
:::# Relativistic mechanics
:::# The geometry of space-time
:::# Physics in spacetime
:::# Relativity and unifying electromagnetism
:::# Status
::I don't know about you, but I couldn't make sense of it, and I think I'm pretty qualified to judge that. For instance velocity composition is in "Consequences", "Composition of velocities", and "Physics in spacetime" ("we can turn the awkward looking law about composition of velocities into ..."). And there is a separate article on [[Velocity-addition formula]] (as ought to). I claim that an organization into kinetics and  dynamics (as is conventially done for all physical theories) is more lucid.

::Now, whether my rewritten ''text'' is clearer is an open question (I hope it is). And doubtless there was a lot of clear material in the original article. It was just very badly organized/mixed with less-than-clear material/overly detailed and needed to be cut into its own article.

::For the record, I am biased in terms of abstract formalisms and theoretical physics. So my characterization of Minkowski space as "four-dimensional Euclidean space with a certain non-positive-definite metric" may not be as clear to those not as acquainted with mathematics. (But hey, I didn't write "flat pseudo-Riemannian manifold"...)

::And, for the record, as to <math>c\to\infty</math>: yes, it's slightly misleading; of course Einstein's constant doesn't change. What it means, effectively, is you set terms involving ''1/c^k'' as zero. This yields the classical limit of a relativistic formula. For instance if you Taylor-expand ''&gamma;mc^2'', subtract off the constant ''mc^2'', and keep only the leading-order term (i.e., discard negative powers of ''c''), you get the nonrelativistic kinetic energy formula. This sort of trick is reasonably common in higher physics/math, like sending <math>\hbar\to0</math> to obtain a (semi)-classical approximation of a quantum formula. Quickly Googling for "c to infty" gives me "non-relativistic limit c->infty" in [http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/the-high-exponent-limit-p-to-infty-for-the-one-dimensional-nonlinear-wave-equation/ Terry Tao's blog] (you surely know [[Terry Tao|Terry goddamn Tao]], right?) and "The k->oo ~ c->oo limit is generally thought to correspond to classical geometry" (arXiv:hep-th/9310098).

My own thoughts are the article in its previous state is much better. The main reasons are the order is better. By first laying out the principles and consequences, then starting on the mathematics at a gentle pace, it allows even a reader with only limited mathematics to appreciate what is involved. It proceeds at a steady pace so in theory you could work through it and pick up the subject.

Now the key information on reference frames, i.e. the principle of relativity is gone, as are the consequences which the reader might be familiar with. The first maths are some rather scary partial differential equations and the spacetime metric, with lots of fairly specialised vocabulary, content that is much better placed towards the end.

And the choice of headings seems a bit odd. Kinematics is not a widely used and certainly in special relativity which is mostly not a mechanics topic it seems misplaced, and as noted above means the order of the theory is rather odd. Putting the "Domain of validity" (the what ?) so high up is a bit odd too, it should be near the end.

Special Relativity need not be an advanced topic: it was a first term first year topic when I was at university, i.e. taught using high school maths. The article before this rewrite is much more suitable for a general audience, without skimping on the more advanced stuff. --<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-5.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 19:14, 9 January 2010 (UTC)

:The usual approach to addressing this issue is to either have a "mathematical derivation" or "formal description" section later in the article (having trouble finding a sample article offhand), or to link to a "mathematics of X" article from a shorter "mathematical derivation" section in the main article (as with [[general relativity]]). Taking either content approach exclusively tends to result in a poor article (an article aimed at laymen tends to either make inappropriate approximations or miss important details, and an article aimed at being accurate tends to be inaccessible to most readers). --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] ([[User talk:Christopher Thomas|talk]]) 21:45, 9 January 2010 (UTC)

:'''SR is primarily a kinematic theory''': most of its interesting consequences are from the Lorentz transformation. Special relativitic kinematics differs sharply from Galilean/Newtonian kinematics. Recall that kinematics is simply motion in the absence of forces (dynamics). This includes spacetime, its symmetries, and motion of particles in the absence of force (Newton's 1st law/geodesics). In Newtonian mechanics, spacetime has Galilean symmetry; SR replaces this wholesale by the Lorentz/Poincaré group, which is completely different (topologically and as Lie groups). Relativistic dynamics differs somewhat from Newtonian dynamics (2nd law), primarily because the kinematics has become radically different (everything becomes four-vectorized, etc.). But this is mostly cosmetic; Newton's second law still holds, suitably relativised. A quick Googling yields [http://www.drphysics.com/syllabus/kinematics/kinematics.html this page from lecture notes for an intro SR class], which clarifies that SR is primarily a kinematic theory.
:'''The previous version of the article was divided into noncovariant notation versus covariant (four-vector) notation.''' I claim that '''notation is not a good way to conceptually organize a topic.''' Perhaps it's better pedagogy, but it ends up treating everything twice. There are many possible formalisms for SR: besides three/four-vectors, you can use quaternions, Clifford/geometric algebra, hyperbolic quaternions, gyrovectors, etc. to describe SR. arXiv:math-ph probably contains dozens more. As Feynman once said, any physicist worth his salt knows many different formalisms for the same physics. '''I do not advocate presenting only the high-level formalism.''' Certainly the three-vector formalism is useful. (For instance thinking of mass as a tensor, i.e., longitudinal/transverse mass, can be helpful in SR mechanics.) The topic needs to be presented in a coherent and non-dumbed-down fashion (unlike [[Intro to special relativity|Intro to SR]]), presenting a reasonable subset of the gamut of possible formalisms, perhaps supplemented by [[Introduction to special relativity]], [[Mathematics of special relativity]], [[Quaternions in special relativity]], etc.
:I fully agree that SR can be understood in an elementary way. (I learnt it in 10th grade, FYI.) That, however, does not mean it's that elementary. (You still learn a lot about representations of the Poincaré group in your 2nd-year graduate QFT class.)
:About domain of validity, etc.: I wasn't sure where to put all the non-mathematical/heuristic bits (history, consequences, experiments, etc.), so I just grouped them under a big Status section.

::: Just getting back to the topic, the varying IP from Stanford wrote "Perhaps it's better pedagogy...", and if that is the case (I've never taught SR so cannot say) the pre-rewrite version is perhaps more accessible too, which was my point. It is better for the average first-time reader, who is probably in high school or has a high school science education. Most will not get as far as the more advanced mathematics, or at least will take a long time getting to it.

:: Why is that so bizarre? Einstein got to SR by asking himself what had to be done to make Maxwell's equations the same for moving observers (moving interial frames). The answer turned out to be the Lorentz transformations for space and time. Now Einstein had the epiphany that perhaps this would need to be necessary for all laws of physics, not just Maxwell's equations: they're all the same in all inertial frames. As is (necessarily) the speed of light. Which means there are no privileged inertial observers. This requires the general application of the Lorentz transformations between frames and observers, and these transformations are not mere math tricks to get Maxwell's equations back, but ACTUAL statements about how the flow and start-point of timekeeping changes between frames, and how spacial measurements change, too. And that's it.  [[User:Sbharris|<font color="blue">S</font>]][[User:Sbharris|<font color="orange">B</font>]][[User:Sbharris|H]][[User:Sbharris|arris]] 19:10, 6 March 2010 (UTC)
:::It's bizarre to define relativity as simply a branch of metrology. It would be far better to define it as a theory of invariance of physical law, or perhaps say something like "space, time, and invariance..." as an initial definition. Regarding inertial frames, a clock can be taken on an arbitrary non-inertial path in flat spacetime between two events to measure a time difference ∆τ. I guess this idea is outside the domain of special relativity according to wikipedia. [[User:Tim Shuba|Tim Shuba]] ([[User talk:Tim Shuba|talk]]) 22:51, 6 March 2010 (UTC)
:::: Ummm, I don't think it's "inside" the domain of SR according to anybody. Two non-colocal events (ie, spacially separated) don't HAVE a ∆τ that everybody agrees on. Any more than they have a spacial separation ∆x that everybody agrees on. The only thing (measure) that all observers agree on, is a combination of these two things, the space-time interval '''I''', the square of which is given by (∆x)<sup>2</sup> - (∆τ)<sup>2</sup>. (Using units where c =1). And no, I don't think SR is defined as "merely" a branch of metrology. It tells how changing intertial viewpoint, changes time and space. It's a philosphical question to say that it tells how ''measurement'' of time and space is changed. What's the difference between the measurement of the thing and the thing itself? Does space contract or just yardsticks? Does time go slower, or just clocks? Ultimately, it doesn't matter. All you have to tell you about these things are measuring tools (including your brain's time-sense and the length of your arms). So it doesn't really matter.

:::::Two events on the trajectory of a clock can certainly be non-colocal, and of course the separation of these events will be timelike. Just take a stopwatch, move around arbitrarily until you are at a different place, and note the elapsed time ∆τ. Or calculate the lifetime (in its own non-inertial frame) of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field from creation until anihilation. Not part of special relativity? Seriously? As far as special relativity being a theory of measurement, what does that mean? Which theories in physics are not theories of measurement? If the answer is "none", then what is this meaningless fluff doing in the first sentence of the article?

{{outdent}}
Seriously, it's not part of relativity that there's some kind of "real" ∆τ between events. That ∆τ depends on who measures it. You can look at a stopwatch that moves from event P1 to event P2, and note the elapsed time on the watch, but there's nothing "special" or real about that time. Some other watch in another frame, if started when the first watch crossed P1, and stopped when the first watch crossed P2, could easily measure a different time-interval between the two events. And of course an observer in a different frame would see a different space-interval also. An example is the muon. They have a half-life of 2.2 μsec in their rest frame. Let's pretend they all live exactly that long-- this would allow them to travel no more than 660 m = .66 km at the speed of light. But muons made in the upper atmosphere travel 10 times that far, or more (often far more). So let's let the muon be the stopwatch, and P1 be its creation from a pion (created by a cosmic ray proton hitting an air atom), and P2 the destruction/decay of the muon, to an electron + 2 neutrinos. In the muon frame, the stopwatch between creation and decay reads 2.2 μsec, but there's nothing more "real" about that time. In the Earth's frame, assuming a muon speed with a tau factor of 10, the time is 22 μsec from creation to destruction, and the distance traveled is 6.6 km. For the muon, the distance is only 0.66 km, but it has no problem making it to the ground from its own viewpoint, because for the muon, the Earth's atmosphere is relativistically compressed/shortened, and is far thinner. What the Earthlings see as 6.6 km flight, the muon sees as only a 0.66 km flight, but since it sees a 10x compressed atmosphere, all is well. The space-time interval in both frames is the same, and it is the only "real" thing thing that everybody agrees on. Not the distance or the time, but a combo of the two.

::Debate about the "reality" of particular quantities is a road to metaphysical mush, so I'll try to avoid that, but you are incorrect in some of your statements. The invariant proper time τ should not be confused with a coordinate time t. For constant velocity (inertial motion) of a clock, any two ticks define timelike separated events with a negative spacetime interval s²=−(∆τ)² with elapsed proper time given by ∆τ=√((∆t)²−(∆x)²) which is invariant. In the rest frame of the clock, ∆x is zero so  ∆τ=∆t in that frame. The elapsed time for any moving object is related to the spacetime interval in the very same way way: the elapsed time is invariant and is the square root of negative of the spacetime interval (assuming appropriate conventions). For an arbitrarily moving clock, the previous sentence is still true but the formula becomes a path integral along the path followed by the clock: ∆τ=∫√((dt)²−(dx)²) which is likewise invariant with ∆τ=∆t in the non-inertial frame of the clock, because the origin of the clock in its own frame is fixed at x=0.<p>For your case of the muon, you have two frames, the muon rest frame where ∆τ=∆t and the earth frame where the muon is moving, in which ∆x≠0 so ∆τ=√((∆t)²−(∆x)²). Both frames here will measure/calculate the same ∆τ, the proper time from the muon creation to its destruction. I think we've been talking past each other a lot, and while much of what you've written is okay, none of it actually addresses the problems I see with the first part of the first sentence. Perhaps someone else will chime in with an opinion about that. If you wish to believe that an elapsed time on an arbitrarily moving clock is not a valid relativistic invariant, go ahead, but that is very, very wrong according to my understanding.

== Free falling or arbitrary acceleration? ==

In the last line of the lead, it said "From the theory of general relativity it follows that special relativity will still apply locally (i.e., to first order) to observers moving on <u>arbitrary trajectories</u>, ..." (emphasis added). This is wrong. I corrected it to say "From the theory of general relativity it follows that special relativity will still apply locally (i.e., to first order) to observers on any <u>free falling trajectory</u>, ...". If the observer is not free falling (e.g. a scientist in his laboratory siting on the surface of the Earth), then there is an effect of [[time dilation]] due to gravity. This [[gravitational redshift]] is proportional to the first power of the elevation of the test clock relative to the reference clock. Thus it is a ''first order'' effect. In other words, special relativity fails in the first order to predict the rate at which time passes. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 08:29, 11 March 2010 (UTC)
:As I understand GTR, spacetime is locally Lorentzian, i.e., at any event, a coordinate system can be found for which the metric components are that of STR to first order.  I'm not sure the former or the later version of the last lead line correctly captures this idea.  After all, in the context of spacetime, local means (infinitesimally) nearby in space ''and'' in time.
:OTOH, if by local we're only referring to space (as implied by the talk of "moving along a trajectory"), then isn't it the case that STR applies equally well to the scientist sitting in his (infinitesimal) laboratory on the surface of the Earth as to a free fall observer?

::JRSpriggs' version seems good to me. We are talking about a spacetime trajectory, i.e. ''trajectory'' is linked to [[world line]].

[[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] ([[User talk:Alfred Centauri|talk]]) 21:05, 11 March 2010 (UTC)
::::Here's how I think about it, which admittedly may not be quite right. Mathematically, the local flat frame at any event in a curved manifold contains in general only that event (of the manifold that is, the rest of the tangent plane is in a tangent space). The tangent space is perfectly SR, but it isn't a physically realizable thing that can be probed with clocks and rods. For either case of local lab frame or local free-falling frame, there will be corrections to SR, called tidal forces, which indicate the presence of curvature. However the local lab frame has corrections to first order, while these first order terms disappear for sufficiently "small" (in space and time) measurements in the free-falling frame. There is no way in general to remove the higher order terms, so the local free-falling frame is the closest thing to a special relativistic inertial frame and is therefore considered the analog to it in general relativity.<p>For any single event in the lab frame, the equivalence with a uniformly accelerated frame is strictly valid at just that one event, and there is obviously no way to perform actual experiments without some extent in spacetime.

:::::I understand what you are saying Tim but what I'm getting at is that the gravitational red shift JR uses as an example of a first order effect is not related to tidal forces AKA curvature.

If I understand all this correctly, the first order terms in JR's example indicate an accelerated coordinate system, not curvature.  Take a look at [[Introduction_to_general_relativity#Physical_consequences | this]] and [[Gravitational_frequency_shift#History | this]] where we find:

::::::This was precisely [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] conclusion in 1911. He considered an accelerating box, and noted that according to the [[special theory of relativity]], the clock rate at the bottom of the box was slower than the clock rate at the top. Nowadays, this can be easily shown in [[Rindler space|accelerated coordinates]]. The metric tensor in [[natural units|units where the speed of light is one]] is:

:::::::<math>
ds^2 = - r^2 dt^2 + dr^2
\,</math>

:::::Correct me if I'm wrong, but, to first order, this is the line element of the spacetime of the lab sitting on the surface of the earth, i.e., the line element of an uniformly accelerated coordinate system in the flat spacetime of STR.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] ([[User talk:Alfred Centauri|talk]]) 00:44, 12 March 2010 (UTC)

To the first order the metric at the surface of the Earth is like that of Minkowski space in [[Rindler coordinates]] as Alfred Centauri observes. However, the observer in Rindler coordinates knows that he is accelerating and can transform the metric from an inertial frame to his accelerating frame. A scientist ignorant of general relativity would presume that since the center of the Earth is the center of an inertial frame (ignoring its rotation about its axis and revolution about the Sun etc.), then he must also be in an inertial frame. But it is the free falling frames which are like inertial frames to the first order.<br>
"''how in principle would curvature be detected locally?''": It cannot be in the first order, that is why we have to focus on which frames are nearly inertial and which are not. Otherwise, what is the difference between SR and GR?<br>
A physicist trying to work with SR and Newtonian gravity would have no reason to expect that the laboratory siting on the surface of the Earth is not inertial, no reason to predict the gravitational redshift. So when he saw it, he would have to conclude that SR is wrong. The only other possibility is that the whole Earth is accelerating, but measurements at the antipode would show that it is "accelerating" in the opposite direction.<br>
Alfred is unconsciously bringing GR type reasoning into SR to try to save it from this problem. That is cheating. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 05:17, 12 March 2010 (UTC)

:Your formulation sounds fine to me. And avoids the problems with trying to explain FTL (faster than light) wavefunction collapse, FTL virtual particle speed, and so on. Those things can't carry information (in the sense of Morse code, etc), so cannot be "signals." But there are all kinds of wacky FTL effects that still are possible even so-- like the EPR-effect correlation "speed," and the fact that the direction of static E and B and G fields all point exactly at their moving sources a distance x away (so long as the sources are not accelerating), and not back at the time-retarded position x/c of the sources (really, they do; there is no [[light-time correction]] needed, so long as the source doesn't accelerate). Light-time correction in position is needed only for light, not static fields. And static E and B and G fields can "escape" black holes, since they're STATIC fields composed of virtual particles, so they can go FTL. It's only signals carried on those fields (disturbances in the force!) that can't get out.

::My reasoning for reverting "speed" to "velocity" was--more or less--one of specificity: While "speed" can refer to many things, distance traveled per unit of time, film sensitivity, a transmission gear ratio, light-gathering ability of an optical system, or a popular drug, "velocity" (to the best of my knowledge) is always used to describe the amount of something--usually distance--over time. Therefore, "velocity" seemed the more specific and accurate of the two terms.

::A quick census of the text, though, shows "speed" used 51 times, while "velocity" was written 33 times. (Nowhere, BTW, did I find the phrase "magnitude of velocity", although it's a great construct that would work very well in a few places.)

For velocities much smaller than that of light, one can neglect the terms with c2 and higher in the denominator. These formulas then reduce to the standard definitions of Newtonian kinetic energy and momentum. This is as it should be, for special relativity must agree with Newtonian mechanics at low velocities.

Actually, I think that the correct derivation of the classical limit is far more subtle than doing a trivial series expansion of the energy in powers of v/c. The fact that c already appears in the equations is not ok. i.m.o., as it already tells you how to appoach the correct scaling limit in which special relativity will tend to classical mechanics.

A non-trivial physics argument should start from equations in which c has been put to 1. One then decides to study the physics of slowly moving, very massive objects. To study this, one can derive an approximate theory by rescaling the relevant variables in a carefully chosen way, so that you approach the limit of infinitely slow and infinitely massive objects, but such that the equations don't all get singular. Compare this with e.g. singular perturbation theory where you have to rescale your variables in a careful way to make boundary layer phenomena visible.

The approximation is then that a situation involving very slow and very massive objects is approximated using equations valid in the infinite scaling limit. In this limit some relations do become singular and are lost. This then means that you need to introduce a new variables that would not be needed in the original theory. In this case you need to introduce a properly rescaled rest energy as a new variable. In the scaling limit this will be rescaled by an infinite factor.

: replying to this: "The intro says the speed of light is always the same irrespective of the motion of the source - but what does this ambiguous statement mean ? Speed with respect to what ?"
: It means relative to the observer, i.e. with respect to the observer. If you have a way to measure lightspeed, and do so while in a stationary room then on a train going at 100mph you will get the same speed each time. Of course "stationary" is also relative, and we are all moving as the Earth rotates, orbits the sun and the sun orbits the galaxy. But none of these motions can be detected in the speed of light: it is the same whenever measured, to the limit of the accuracy of the measuring technique.
: There is a practical problem that it's only possible to measure light going two ways, or in a round trip, as it's impossible to synchronise clocks with the remote station you'd need at the other end of your experiment. So in theory the one-way speed could vary - be different going there and coming back - and we'd never know as we can't detect it. But this would both go against intuition and against common understanding of the laws of physics (though both could be wrong as they have been in the past).

:In reply to Mr.Blackburne, I'd agree that the two way speed could be different each way, and if it were not for Lorentz length contraction, this would be detectable by a Michelson-Morley setup. So the assumption of length contraction depends precisely upon the to and fro speeds being C+V and C-V. I don't agree that it goes "against intuition and against common understanding of the laws of physics". In fact, intuition and common understanding of laws of physics would lead us to expect different speeds to and fro. It is special relativity that counter-intuitively introduces length contraction in such a way as to make any speed differential undetectable in a round trip.
:Einstein's 1905 S.R. paper specifically assumes speeds of C-V and C+V for the to and fro speeds of light emitted from a moving source in order to derive the Lorentz transformations.

: In reply to JR Spriggs the technique of slowly moving synchronised clocks apart, even assuming it worked in the sense of maintaining "absolute" synchronisation at distance, could not be assumed to always give the same one-way speed of light. Again, as above, if it were possible hypothetically to achieve absolute synchronisation between two positions, then unless they were both stationary the speeds would be C+V or C-V.

[[User:DVdm|DVdm]] ([[User talk:DVdm|talk]]) 18:41, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

:No. What I'm saying is not controversial. It's perfectly correct. Special relativity only says that the two-way there-and-back speed of light is a constant - not the one way speed. Nothing in SR says the one-way speed is a constant and nor is there any experimental evidence that it is. Ruslik, Blackburne and Hogbin I'm afraid, all seem to have misunderstood a fundamental feature of special relativity. 

:Let me prove the point with three separate items which any gainsayer must address rather than just saying "no, you're wrong, it is constant" which is futile and devoid of logic.

:(A) Two observers in high enough relative motion will detect opposite red or blue shifts in spectral lines from a distant star. Similarly a binary star system shows alternating red & blue shifts which are clear indications of light being received at C-v or C+v.

:(B) The fundamental Lorentz transformation formulae of SR are specifically derived from assuming that the speed of light with respect to a moving source is C+v or C-v in direction of motion, and SQRT(C^2-v^2) laterally. Not only is this explicit in Einstein's 1905 paper (look it up in Dover), but the Michelson-Morley experiment is regarded as definitive confirmation of it. The derived SR length contraction is needed purely to compensate for the C+v and C-v journey otherwise taking longer than the lateral reflection.

:(C) Relativity of Simultaneity is utterly dependant on differential one way speeds of light. The classic setup is two clocks at each end of a (sufficiently rapidly) moving train. When they are synchronised on board by sending light signals between them, the observer on the platform finds the forward train clock to be set "behind" (ie. lagging) the rear train clock. This happens precisely because the light takes longer to go from rear to front than to go from front to rear. Thus if say, the round trip is 4 nanoseconds then a signal from the rear arrives at the front a little over 2 nanoseconds later, taking slightly less to come back. So when the front clock is set to half-way between times of transmission & reception, it will be set slightly behind the rear clock because the rear has gone slightly past 2 nano secs when reflection occurs.

:Let someone who thinks one-way speed is constant try and explain Doppler shift, length contraction and relative simultaneity as above ! - Mike Greene [[Special:Contributions/212.85.28.88|212.85.28.88]] ([[User talk:212.85.28.88|talk]]) 10:58, 18 September 2010 (UTC)
::No, the speed of light is a constant, ''c'', whichever direction is measured. At least that is what special relativity says. The one way speed of light is a practical and philosophical problem: out theory says ''c'' is a constant, we can confirm this and relativity in many different ways and it explains the large-scale universe remarkably well. But we cannot measure the one way speed as accurately as the two way speed. So while we know ''c'' to a high degree of accuracy that's using two-way measurements: in theory there could greater uncertainty in the one way speed, but as that would invalidate relativity and probably show up in experiments in some way it's not something that gives many people sleepless nights. In any case it is bound a small effect, and your examples are all incorrect: the speed of light is ''c'' in all cases (or a little less not in a vacuum) to all observers up to a high degree of accuracy.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 11:41, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

So your distinction between one-way and two-way velocities of light becomes a mere metaphysical fantasy. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 17:13, 18 September 2010 (UTC)

::::To respond to the three items mentioned by Mike Green:

::::(A) This is NOT a clear indication of light being received at ''C-v'' or ''C+v''. Red and blue are frequency measures. It is only a clear indication that the frequencies of the light received are different. Frequency (<math>\nu</math>), speed of light  (''C'') and wavelength  (<math>\lambda</math>) are related by <math>\lambda \nu = C</math>. If the frequency changes, then either the wavelength or the speed of light has changed in such a way that the above relationship is maintained. To say that it is a clear indication that the speed of light is changing to ''C+v'' or ''C-v'' is to assume that the wavelength is unchanged, which, according to the theory of relativity, is incorrect. The theory of relativity says that, in fact, the speed of light is unchanged and the wavelength is Lorentz contracted. This will yield the relativistic Doppler equation.

::::(B) I have not read the paper carefully, but I cannot imagine that Einstein said that the forward and backward speeds of light are C+v and C-v respectively, while a major point of his paper was that C is constant. Anyway, the question is not "how did Einstein derive the equations" but rather "what is the present interpretation of these equations". 

::::(C) In this example, you have assumed a synchronization method. You say "the observer on the platform finds the forward train clock to be set "behind" (ie. lagging) the rear train clock". You must ouline exactly how is this observation made. This observation cannot be made without making assumptions about the forward and backward speed of light, or assuming that slowly bringing the clocks together will hardly affect their time readouts. If you assume the forward and backward speeds are different, then fine, you can come up with a consistent theory which will imply a preferred inertial frame. If you assume they are the same, as Einstein did, then again, you come up with a consistent theory in which there is no preferred inertial frame. Einstein's postulate that all inertial frames of reference are physically equivalent means that the preferred frame that is constructed by assuming different back and forth speeds can never be physically detected. So far, this has held up. Lets use Occam's razor and pick the simplest assumption, as Einstein did, rather than invent undetectable preferred reference frames.

::::In this regard, JRSpriggs question stands - how do you detect the difference in the forward and backward velocities? Answer: you cannot without making arbitrary assumptions which pre-determine the answer. Thats what Einstein did, and he chose the simplest, assumption which does not involve fantasy reference frames.

== Question? ==

In classical Physics, as shown by Newton in his Principia, The physical principles involved in causing motion in one direction can be be correctly calculated without consideration of the degree of motion in an orthogonal direction. So 2 parallel travelling particles may be caused to orthogonally deviate from their parallel paths by the same amounts regardless of their joint travelling velocity in the parallel direction. The question is: Is this still true in accordance with the theory of special relativity?[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 13:41, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
: Yes. In each case, i.e. under Newtonian laws and under special relativity, they have the same [[inertial frame of reference]], so each to the other looks stationary. If you were somehow unable to see the rest of the universe, and were moving with one of these particles looking at the other, there would be no way to tell you are moving. But according to special relativity the 'travelling' frame is no different from the stationary frame. You might as well say the particles are stationary and everything else is moving relative to them, and any 'fixed' frame you choose is moving relative to others: the earth is moving relative to the sun, the sun is moving within the galaxy, the galaxy is moving relative to others, and so on. There is no fixed frame and all frames are relative to all others.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 14:38, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

::I think that John Blackburne misunderstood WFPM's question.
::To WFPM: No. For example, motion in the ''x'' direction increases the relativistic mass which reduces the ability to move in the ''y'' and ''z'' directions. If this were not so, then an object could travel at anything less than the speed of light in each of the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' directions simultaneously. This would mean that the object could travel at up to sqrt(3)&nbsp;''c'' diagonally which is not possible. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 15:48, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
: Hm, yes, if you put it that way. If you consider two moving particles, i.e. moving relative to your current frame, then relativistic effects would make a difference for them moving at relativistic i.e. near-light speeds. One reason is as things go faster and gain energy they gain mass, so take a larger force to move them. They could never reach √3''c'' as it would take an infinite amount of energy to get them to and past lightspeed. In their own frame of reference they can be pushed apart as quickly as at rest, but because of time dilation they will appear to move apart more slowly, again limiting their speed in any frame. So, yes, there would be a relativistic effect, but it depends on your frame of reference.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 16:02, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

Right! But we have this expanding universe concept, which involves galaxies moving away from a presumably center of mass, and we're on a gravitational slope somewhere, seeing a reddening of light in all directions, due to the universe expansion factor. But within this 3 dimensional space/1 dimensional time continuum, there must be a plane that separates the greater expansion galaxies on one side and the lesser expansion on the other, and is more or less perpendicular and thus points in the local direction of the expansion vector. In other words. is the Red shift value a directional value or just an expansion value? And shouldn't that be a factor in astronomical observations? And is that a factor of consideration in Special Relativity subject matter?[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 21:32, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
: The usual model for the expanding universe is a 3D space that wraps back on itself in 4D, i.e. so there is no 'centre' in the 3D space. Instead that centre is in the 4D space and the universe is in a sense expanding away from that. But we can't detect this as we only exist in 3D, we can only infer it from the things we can observe such as that space is expanding but with no centre and no boundary. If we could go far enough we could in theory also measure the curvature, but the distances are so large this is not a practical prospect. A historical parallel is the surface of the Earth: primitive peoples often thought the world flat, bounded and with a centre, which they often thought significant so associated it with e.g. a religious centre like Jerusalem. But we know the earth is round, and the 2D surface is curved, unbounded and has no centre, or at least not one with a latitude and longitude.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 22:06, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

::That's not strictly true; even if you assume that the [[shape of the universe]] is closed, that doesn't mean it's embedded in any higher-dimensional space. The whole point of [[Riemann geometry]] is that we only have to define the ''local'' topology of spacetime (at all points in spacetime) to get a description of it. The idea of it being "within" some higher-dimensional space stems from the teaching examples used (the expanding balloon analogy), not anything in the math itself.

::With regards to the original poster's question about expanding from a central point, that concept only makes sense if one assumes that the universe is finite and ''has a boundary''. As you point out, if it wraps back on itself, any given choice for "central" point looks as good as any other. The usual default assumption is that it's infinite and approximately "flat" (not curved). In this case too, you can pick any point and make it look like a center of expansion (this is just an arbitrary choice of origin for the coordinate system you choose to use). The mathematical description of the model is at [[FLRW metric]], and of the expanding coordinate system that results is at [[metric expansion of space]]. --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] ([[User talk:Christopher Thomas|talk]]) 22:26, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

I'm not defining a boundary. I'm merely listening to a current comment that they have found evidence of a galaxy that is 10+ billion light years from ours and must only be a few hundred million years old. And if I can point to something that old in a certain direction, why can't I draw a conclusion about a spacial geometry concept? Do you say that that distance is still local geometry?[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 03:02, 22 October 2010 (UTC)

I guess that my trouble is that I consider the shape of the universe to be a sphere that fills and thus is .5236 of a cube. And the only question is the size of the cube. And before I got into universe expansion I estimated the size of the cube to be 10 billion Megaparsecs, and thus have a volume of 523+ billion cubic Megaparsecs, which is about the right number of Cubic Megaparsecs needed for 100 billion Galaxies. But now we have "Expansion" and I cant have a cubical volume of space concept for the universe? Well then what shape is it?[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 03:15, 22 October 2010 (UTC)

:The shape of the ''part of the universe we can see'' (the [[observable universe]]) is a sphere, but that's just because the age of the universe limits how far light that reaches us can have travelled. Anything farther away is invisible to us; that doesn't mean that distance marks the end of the universe. Similarly, in an expanding universe there might be parts that always remain hidden to us (because in the coordinate system we're looking at them from they're moving away from us faster than light). There is still no edge at that point, so saying it's a sphere of radius 13.x billion light-years or 4x.x light-years or what-have-you (depending on coordinates chosen) is incorrect. As far as we can tell, the universe continues on indefinitely in all directions. That is why your question about shape puzzles me. --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] ([[User talk:Christopher Thomas|talk]]) 05:49, 22 October 2010 (UTC)

So here we are, lost in space!! And we can't see an edge to our volume. And what we can see is reddening as if it is moving away in all directions. And we calculate from that movement that it was all in one location 13+ Billion years ago. And somebody comes up with the 11-11 theory re the base 10 log values of stars-galaxies in our universe, and I have a book called "The pictorial Atlas of the Universe" by Kevin Krisciunas and Bill Yenne (Brompton Books Corp 1989) that shows Galaxies in spacial volumes kind of floating around like cumulous clouds with a concentration of 1 Galaxy per Cubic Megaparsec. So what is an Engineer supposed to do other than imagine a volume of space that more or less contains this bevy of concepts? And now comes this news of a galaxy that considered to be a "few" hundred million years old, as it was when the light left it 10+ billion years ago, which sould point a space-time arrow through this volume from our position in the direction of the original position of the universe. Isn't that what I should think?[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 01:10, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

:The key point is that from any other location within the universe, it also looks like it's expanding in all directions away from that location. Any location will do; making this a formal assumption is what the "[[cosmological principle]]" is all about. There are solutions to the equations of general relativity that give you a universe that looks like it's expanding in all directions from any point within the universe, so the usual assumption is that this is what's happening with our universe. --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] ([[User talk:Christopher Thomas|talk]]) 06:51, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

If I have a 3 dimensional volume of space with contained objects, and wish to expand the volume, without distorting the shape, I can't just do that from any point. And if I chose the volumetric center as the point of expansion, (which retains the shape), I'm not accomplishing anything but changing the space unit dimension factor, which nobody knows the basics of in the first place. It's kind of like analyzing the system of hexagonal closest packing, where all objects are all spherical of the same size and are in contact with their 12 neighbors, and if you want to expand the volume you just make all the objects larger and the distance of expansion (away from the center) becomes accumulative. How does that differ?[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 08:45, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

:Sure you can - scale it. Scaling it with one choice of origin gives you the same result as scaling with any other choice of origin, if you change the observer's position and velocity such that they're on top of and at rest with respect to the new origin. The whole point of ''relativity'' is that both observer positions/velocities are equally valid (they're both [[inertial frame]]s). The whole point of the ''cosmological principle'' is that we wouldn't expect one location to be any more special than another. In this case, you get a solution that is consistent with both. For detailed math, please see [[FLRW metric]], per my previous comment. --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] ([[User talk:Christopher Thomas|talk]]) 21:39, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

I would think that in order to agree with Hubble's law of universal expansion, there would have to be evidence of accumulative expansion values related to the comparative Galactic distances. How else are you going to arrive at a value of 75 km/second per Megaparsec or whatever.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 09:06, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

But hey now! If I give you the Spherical concept of the universe plus the spacetime arrow pointing in a certain direction, and then I look into space in the opposite direction, What am I supposed to see? Should I expect to see an equivalently spacetime removed Galaxy for the sake of Symmetry? And should I more closely check the Expansion factor in that direction for uniformity? Its kind of like wondering how fast 2 beams of light are separating when they're pointing in opposite directions, and particularly when you think that those beams consist of matter particles.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 14:56, 24 October 2010 (UTC)
== Time dilation and length contraction ==

THE BEGINNING OF THIS SECTION IS NOT CLEAR. PLEASE REVIEW WITH THE CAPITAL CHARACTERS.

:See also: Twin paradox

Writing the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences we get
△t’=γ(△t-(v△x/c^2)) 
:DOES {in terms of coordinate differences} MEANS 
::(T2’-T1’)=γ((T2-T1)-(V(X2-X1)/C^2))?
△x’=γ(△x-v△t)
and
△t=γ(△t’+(v△x’/c^2)),
△x=γ(△x’+v△t’)

Suppose we have a clock at rest in the unprimed system S. Two consecutive ticks of this clock are then characterized by Δx = 0. If we want to know the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, we can use the first equation and find:
△t’=γ△t (for events satisfying Δx = 0)
:DOES {the relation between the times between these ticks} MEANS ABOVE EQUATION, △t’=γ△t, IS FOR TICKS T2’=M+1 AND T1’=M FOR △t’, THEN, T2=N+1 AND T1=N FOR △t? 
::IF THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS, THEN △t’=γ△t MEANS 1=γ*1, SO THAT γ=1 AND △t’=△t, NO TIME DILATION. 
::IF THAT IS NOT WHAT IT MEANS, THEN COULD SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
This shows that the time Δt' between the two ticks as seen in the 'moving' frame S' is larger than the time Δt between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock. This phenomenon is called time dilation.

:John, you cannot combine the equations for time dilation and length contration the way you tried to do it. When you do that, you effectively combine two events satisfying both Δt’=0 ''and'' Δx = 0. When you look at the transformation equations, you will notice that this can be only be valid for two events satisfying Δt’ = Δt = Δx' = Δx = 0, in other words for equations of the form 0=0. You deduced "... THEN Δt’=γΔt MEANS 1=γ*1, SO THAT γ=1 AND Δt’=Δt, NO TIME DILATION", but you forgot the case Δt’=Δt=0, from which 1=γ*1 does not follow. You "divided by zero", so to speak.

Thanks a lot, DVdm. You are the person I need to talk to. I thought that some thing wrong in this short paragraph, from "Writing..." to "...is called time dilation." because I was unable to explain the "△t’" mathematically to fit in the "Two consecutive ticks of this clock". I asked for help. 

::Your answer to JRSpriggs did not mention about any detail of the CALCULATES THE COORDINATES like using regular concepts of {a time period △t’}, which is normally represented by {from time t1' to another time t2', so that △t’=(t2'-t1')}. What is the mathematical value of the first tick of that clock and what is the value for the next tick of that clock? If there is no such value, then, don't use "△t’", use something else like Ut' to represent the time period between two consecutive ticks of the moving clock. However, if you do so, you must figure out how you adjust the equations of LT to fit your Ut' and Ut. We know that △x’=γ(△x-vUt) and Ut’=γ(Ut-(v△x/c^2)) is not going to fit for every event location with x-coordinate x in the stationary system and x'-coordinate x' in the moving system.

Thanks DVdm. As you can tell, I just try to make this section more reader friendly. My main point is that, the usage of a popular symbol △t in this section is very different from popular definition. As I know, △t is for the difference of two times, △t=(t2-t1), so that I hope someone can bridge the gap. 
::The evidence is in the statement {the time Δt' between the two ticks (of the clock in S) as seen in the 'moving' frame S'}. There is no t2' and t1' so that it looks like Δt' represents the time interval for one unit of time in S'. That means it will be miss recognized as Δt'=1, and the same for Δt=1. I mean, physically, {the one unit of time} in S' is larger than {the one unit of time} in S, that is clearly described but mathematically it is not presented properly. Hope you can improve it.

Especially, when you think about the popular time equation of SR, t'=t/γ, '''which is also true for △t'=△t/γ with regular definition''' as (t2'-t1')=(t2-t1)/γ; don't you think this section needs some modification?

Thanks DVdm. Now, we have △t for the difference of two times, △t=(t2-t1). In this paragraph, t1 will be the time of the first tick in S and t2 is for the time of the second tick in S. If we arrange the clock to stay in S, we will derive △t'=γ△t like in the current paragraph; if we let the clock to stay in S', like what Einstein did in his paper dated 6-30-1905, then we will derive △t'=△t/γ, like what Einstein had derived before. That is why JRSpriggs said {This is the reverse of way that I would have chosen to do it, if it were up to me.}
::The reason original paragraph did make sense physically is, if △t' means the length of {one unit of time} in S' and △t means the length of {one unit of time} in S, then △t'=γ△t did clearly mean time dilation. To avoid 1=γ*1, it can be written like 1s'=γ*1s, or Ut'=γUt.
However, if we use 1s' to represent the length of <time unit> in S', and 1s to represent that in S, then the definition of 1s' and 1s will make them not compatible with Lorentz equation. Then, we need to figure out some other way to use the symbols 1s' and 1s to explain time dilation. 
:I think, probably, if we let that reference clock stay in S' for now, we will have more time to find a proper solution for 1s' and 1s, or Ut' and Ut. It will be nice if we can see one unit of time in S' is longer than one unit of time in S mathematically, because it makes more sense, physically.

:You've got it all wrong and you clearly do not understand the setup. The text clearly explains that the clock is at rest in S, so, when we have two consecutive tick events on that clock, then Δt can indeed mean the "''''' length of one unit of time in S '''''", but then Δt' does '''not''' mean the "''''' length of one unit of time in S' '''''". Δt' would then mean the "''''' length as measured in S' of one unit of time in S '''''", and the equation Δt' = γ Δt expresses time dilation.

You are right about the setup, {Δt' would then mean the "length (t2'-t1')Ut' as measured in S' for one unit of time 1*(Ut) in S}. But, in that setup the equation Δt' = γ Δt expresses time speeding, not dilation, because for all |v|<c, we have γ>1 and Δt'>Δt. Assume that γ=5, we will have Δt=1 and Δt'=5, that means {the event of two ticks in S} is measured as 1*Ut in S and measured as 5*Ut' in S'. That means Δt'=5*Ut'=1*Ut=Δt, Ut'=Ut/5; the clock in S' is running faster. But, Einstein wanted it the other way.

== 4th dimension contraction mathematics ==

In the Geometry of space time section section it is desired to treat time as just a 4th dimension, but with the explicit assumption that it is either orthogonal or maybe just equally related to the other 3 dimensions. However, since we don't have an orthogonal 4th dimensional space direction, how about settling for an equally related 4th spacial dimension, which is the diagonal of a cube dimension, and which is equally related to the orthogonal 3 dimensions of the sides of the cube? Then, in space time considerations, the 3 side dimensions of the cube could be the 3 spacial dimensions, and the diagonal dimension could be the time dimension. Then we could plan a 3 dimensional Michelson-morley light interference test and see if we get the same results in 3 orthogonal directions as we get in only 2 dimensions. And it allows the possible spacial locations of a point in 3 dimensional space (such as the path of the light beams) to be reduced to 2 dimensional direction versus time location system on a flat surface in the same manner as is done for the Lorentz time-distance correction calculations, but the mathematics of the correction are not the same because of the lack of orthogonality of motion of the light beams, (on the 2 dimensional chart), and I haven't been able to work it out.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 21:24, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

You'll find that the natural geometry of these rotations in flat or Minkowski space, involves entirely tanh, cosh, and sinh functions of angles, and the inverse hyberbolic functions to get angles from ratios of quantities.

::The diagonal direction is NOT [[orthogonal]] to the three principal directions of a cube. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 05:57, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

Didn't say it was! Said it was "equally related" which is about the best you can do in a 4th spacial dimension. And I've figured out that the point of return of a 3 dimensional signal to the cubic diagonal line is at the 2/3rds point on the line which has a total length within the cube of 1.732 (square root of 3). but that's when there is no relative velocity of movement in any direction. but if there's a transition in any of the 3 orthogonal directions, the math gets beyond me. And I appreciate the hyperbolic geometry reference but I don't know how to use it and shame on me! But it's not the same math as the orthogonal directions correction of the Lorentz correction, because in this case when one signal travels up  and downstream in the river, the other is traveling at a not 45 degree angle and not all the way across, and I think the correction might be different. And I'm sure that some mathematician can work that right out and tell me how wrong I am. And anyway I think that the results of a 3 dimensional interference test would be better than a 2 dimensional as a means of disproving the ether theory.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 07:31, 25 October 2010 (UTC)

The experiment would probably involve a light transmission to three mirrors at say a 1000 ft hypotenuse distance and at a 120 degree azimuth angle from each other, but the mirrors would have to reflect the light back from an elevation of 577 ft above the ground plane. In this instance the diagonal of the tested 1000 foot cube stands in a vertical direction above the light emission location.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 05:10, 29 October 2010 (UTC)
: It doesn't matter, however you measure it, i.e. in whatever directions, the speed of light is the same. That is what [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson and Morley found]]. As long as you are in an inertial frame all directions are the same and the speed of light is the same constant in all directions, or at least that's what has been confirmed to a extremely high degree of accuracy many times since M & M.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 15:34, 29 October 2010 (UTC)

The only way I can see for that to happen is for all light emission to be at right angles to whatever direction the emitting particle is moving.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 22:08, 29 October 2010 (UTC)

:The whole point of the [[Lorentz transform]], and of special relativity itself, is that each observer has a (different) deformed coordinate system such that they all agree on the speed of light even if they disagree about what direction it's travelling, and about the speeds, masses, and rate of time flow for each of the observers.

: It's how it is: light speed is constant in any inertial frame. The discrepancy which I think you're seeing is accounted for in two ways. First any light transmitted by a moving source is redshifted or blueshifted, so it stays the same speed but loses or gains frequency. This relates to another way of relating the frames, that their clocks run at different rates, a phenomena called [[time dilation]]. This means two observers can both measure the same light beam going at ''c'', despite being in different frames of reference so one is moving relative to the other. Again this is all experimentally tested physics: time dilation in particular has been demonstrated in experiments, despite perhaps being counter-intuitive.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 22:18, 29 October 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for the comment. And I understand about the Doppler effect. But consider the emission of light by a moving entity. If he is moving in the direction of the light beam, and the beam cant advance faster than the speed of light, then he is loosing his ability to get rid of kinetic energy of translation in that direction (which is proportional to M times delta V squared). So even if he has (time dilation) time enough to get rid of the same number of light particles, they wont be carrying off the same amount of kinetic energy. And since they cant move faster than c, they can't individually carry off a greater amount of energy. And the closer he gets to c velocity, the less ability he has to give off energy in that direction. And I can't think of anything else the light emission process does other than carry off released energy as the result of some physical process.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 01:57, 30 October 2010 (UTC)

:The light is blue-shifted in the frame of the observer you're using, thus carrying off more energy (and momentum). This is a special case addition of velocities at relativistic speeds (which doesn't work the way you probably expect it to). For further details, once again, please ask at a forum that's actually intended for teaching people about relativitiy. --[[User:Christopher Thomas|Christopher Thomas]] ([[User talk:Christopher Thomas|talk]]) 07:57, 30 October 2010 (UTC)

Well thanks for bearing with me, and maybe some mathematician will calculate the Lorentz correction that should occur in my 3 dimensional MM test, and then we'll see if it is the same as for the conventional 2 direction MM test. And with regard to the blue-shift property, you might consider the Doppler effect analogy re the energy rate of reception of the sound energy of an approaching airplane and remember what happens when his rate of approach becomes that of the velocity rate of sound transmission.[[User:WFPM|WFPM]] ([[User talk:WFPM|talk]]) 12:46, 30 October 2010 (UTC)

== Space travel limits ==

I  added this section:

As we can not travel faster than light one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the earth than 40 light years, if the pilot  is active between the age of 20 and 60. So human space pilots would never be able to reach more than the very few solar systems which exist within the limit of 20-40 light years from the earth. But that is wrong. Because of the time dilation he can travel thousands of light years during his 40 years as a space pilot. If he has a spaceship which accelerates with a suitable 1G he will after 10 years reach speeds close to the speed of light, and the time dilation will increase his lifetime to thousands of years, seen from the reference system outside his spaceship. See the sentences about muon decay time above. If he returns to the earth he will land thousands of years into the future. His speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on earth, and he will not measure his speed as being higher than the speed of light, but he will see a length contraction of the universe in his traveling direction. So, although no observer can observe speeds higher than the speed of light humans can travel a lot faster than the speed of light if we use a bastard unit for speed measurement. It is a bastard unit because we mix measurements from different reference systems. We use the time measurement from the space pilot's reference system inside his spaceship, and we use the length measurement from the reference system outside the spaceship. But although it is a bastard unit it is very useful for practical space travel. 

We can compare this with the bastard unit which is created when we measure how far a muon can travel during its lifetime. It should only be able to travel 660 meter before it is dissolved but because of the time dilation at the speed it has it can travel for many kilometers before it is dissolved. In this calculation too, we are creating a bastard unit because we mix measurements from two different reference systems. In the reference system of the muon it can only travel 660 meters in the earth atmosphere, but the earth atmosphere is very thin because of length dilation, so the muon can be detected at the earth surface. 

I can add the mathematical formula which describes how far you can travel, you can insert the acceleration and travel time and the result is the length of the travel, I have that formula somewhere in my archives. Do you want it? [[User:Roger491127|Roger491127]] ([[User talk:Roger491127|talk]]) 13:27, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

Searching for a source we can cite as reference for this section

I found a scientific paper on internet 10 years ago which says the same thing, but I can not find it now. 

At http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light I found a sentence which partially supports it: 

"Proper speeds

If a spaceship travels to a planet one light year (as measured in the Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be less than one year as measured by the traveller's clock..." 

I found a reference, about muons but, of course, also applicable for spaceships:

Copy of a comment on my user talk page:

As it happens your general point, that special relativity actually enables extremely high speed travel (far beyond the speed of light) as defined by "ship measure" 
vship = (apparent distance traveled measured by stationary observer)/(apparent time elapsed by ship clocks),
is quite correct, and has been known for decades. Arthur C Clarke described it well in one of his early books (? I think it must have been The Exploration of Space, ca 1951?), referencing a paper published in the 1940s I think it was. It is also laid out mathematically in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's standard text Gravitation on relativity, around page 105 I think it is.
The "gotcha" is of course that "you can't go home again" (alas), together with the cruel fact that no currently conceivable rocket or vehicle can ever approach the performance needed to take advantage of this loophole. You might want to look also at Minkowski diagram, which has a section on the fundamental impossibility of exceeding c, if current notions of time and causality are valid. Cheers, Wwheaton (talk) 15:08, 21 March 2011 (UTC)

Who says you can't go home again? You can travel back to earth, but, of course, thousands of years have passed on earth. 

Other problems which can be overcome: You need a motor which can deliver a lot of power for a long time, like a nuclear submarine motor which can work for 20 years without re-fueling. Add some extra capacity or extra fuel and you have the motor you need. 

You need food and water for the pilot for 40 years. By recycling the water and compress the food into small tablets or grow some of the food in the ship this is not an impossible feat.

At extremely high speeds all kinds of space dust and even the two hydrogen atoms per cubic meter we find in "absolute empty space" may become a strong resistance to the ship, like thin air can burn a spaceship returning from space at high velocity. 

We also need some mass to accelerate to increase the speed of the spaceship. 

We can solve both of these problems by traveling out of this galaxy before we go up to really high speeds. The space outside the galaxy is free from dust and we can gather up the hydrogen atoms and accelerate them to increase the speed, after we have used up the store of mass we need at the beginning of the travel. 

Anyhow, this is a fact of physics which we may, or may not, be able to use to really high effect while using the earth as the starting point, but we can probably use it after moving the starting point to a place where the space is very clean. As our technology progress and the population of the earth become bigger we will probably start producing very big cylindrical spaceships with a bright lamp along the middle axis, shielding half of it with a reflector. So when the ship rotates to give the millions of passengers a 1G environment they will experience a day, a sundown, a night and a sunrise. 

Using such ships we can search for other inhabitable planets, or live on them forever, or travel to very empty and clean places in space, where this kind of travel faster than light, in simple terms, is relatively safe. [[User:Roger491127|Roger491127]] ([[User talk:Roger491127|talk]]) 15:49, 21 March 2011 (UTC)

Building such very big ships will become necessary to spread out the human race, for safety reasons. To have all humans on one single planet is very risky, a single big comet can kill all of us. So, following the old saying "Do not put all of your eggs in one basket." we simply need to spread out the human race. Another reason is that our sun will explode in around 4 billion years, but comets is a much more urgent reason.

This section is completely wrong so please remove it. You can't travel faster than light no matter in what frame of reference you're in. So 1ly of distance could be covered in no less than 1 year, NO MATTER how fast you're moving. To be clear if you travel with near light speed your time would slow down, but you'd be getting shorter, so in total you'd travel from point A to point B for the same amount of time, as one would observe while standing still. Remember that the space-time interval is constant, so if your time dilates the length you'd have to travel increases!  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.90.43.45|78.90.43.45]] ([[User talk:78.90.43.45|talk]]) 16:24, 19 May 2011 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Tough question ==

Note:- This needs a bit of imagination.
I am an astronomer and have also studied about light. Last month I and my colleagues made an astonishing discovery…. Aliens, who can change their shape, colour etc!!! 2 of them, Zap and Zest Al came to live on Earth. Yesterday, Zap mentioned that Al Nazeer (their planet) had great leaps of technology. Then my love for knowledge, especially in the field of light, rekindled. He took the shape of a machine and I stepped into it.  We were transported into a dark room. A ray of light came out of the machine. Then we accelerated to 3 * 10^8 m/s. Then the acceleration reduced to 0. So we were in an inertial frame. Yet according to the 2nd postulate, the speed of the ray = 3*10^8m/s w.r.t us. Thus the ray is travelling faster than us. But we are travelling at the speed of light. Thus the ray is travelling faster than the speed of light!!!??? How is this possible???

thanks

:It's not possible for material bodies to reach the speed of light (otherwise relativistic energy and momentum would become infinite). So in Earth's frame, light travels at the speed of light, and the "dark room" with a speed '''less''' than that of light. And in the rest frame of the "dark room", light travels at the speed of light while the room is at rest. The velocities in the different frames are mutually connected by the relativistic [[Velocity-addition formula]]. --[[User:D.H|D.H]] ([[User talk:D.H|talk]]) 08:00, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

:::Both correct, ofcourse.  I'd like to add that photons are mass-less particles so relativistic energy and momentum don't become infinite for them, and in fact, every photon travels at the speed of light.  The difference in photons is their relative energy, which manifests as the wavelength aka frequency of light.  this could be interpreted as it's "momentum" so to speak - replacing kinetic energy w/an electric/potential energy of sorts.

:::and as far as gravity is concerned (according to relativity, at least), it's actually mass+energy that causes gravity so it's the same-difference to gravity. (it's just that since e=m^c^2+...; since m has the c^2 term on it, it tends to be the dominate form of energy so it tends to do the most bending of space in massive particles.

:::in truth, however, a universe guided purely by the laws of special relativity would be hamiltonian; that is, the future would be exactly predictable from the past and vice-versa, so there'd really be no meaningful concept of "time", just different ways to look at what is ultimately the same frozen state.  that's where quantumn physics and gravity come into play... they both (individually) introduce statistical irreversibility (better known as "entropy").  and with it the conventional notion of time as novelty.  however this version of "time" is incompatible with special relativity's version.  (or at least the relation is very non-trivial.)  that is one thing that makes it difficult to combine SR and quantumn physics w/gravity.   oh, and on that note, SR and quantumn physics were combined decades ago by Paul Dirac.  The resulting equation predicted the existence of antimatter.  gravity being such a weak effect, however, it's doubtful -- in my opinion -- that such a synthesis would really be all that useful, as a practical matter. but i digress. look at [[lorentz transform]] and [[proper velocity]] to understand the relations of time and speed proposed by SR.

== Incorrect statement about massless particles ==

The article states: "Furthermore, he assumed that the energy/momentum of light transforms like the energy/momentum of massless particles, which was known to be true from Maxwell's equations." This isn't true. There is no mention of massless particles in the two 1905 Einstein papers ("On the electrodynamics of moving bodies" and "Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?"). In the first paper, he proves based on Maxwell's equations that the energy of a light wave transforms in a certain way (identically to the scaling factor of the frequency given by the relativistic Doppler shift). In the second paper he refers back to the same result. Neither paper says anything about massless particles.

== How does it work? ==

In the section about reference frames, one can read the following:
"For example, the explosion of a firecracker may be considered to be an "event". We can completely specify an event by its four space-time coordinates: The time of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial location define a reference point. Let's call this reference frame S.
In relativity theory we often want to calculate the position of a point from a different reference point.
Suppose we have a second reference frame S′, whose spatial axes and clock exactly coincide with that of S at time zero, but it is moving at a constant velocity v with respect to S along the x-axis."

Physicists claim that two observers considering the same event (the explosion of a firecracker) will assign different values (x,t) and (x',t') to the coordinates of this event. How can special relativity decide whether x is larger or smaller than x' ? How can special relativity decide whether t is larger or smaller than t' ? On which ground?
 
S' is moving in respect to S and S is moving in respect to S'. But the principle of relativity forbids stating that one of them moves objectively faster than the other. So which physical criterion are they going to invoke to break the symmetry?

Is it the assumption that both observers move away from each other? What would happen if they were moving toward each other?

Is it the fact that their relative motion actually reflects that one observer has objectively a larger velocity in respect to the firecracker than the other observer? … But which one?

The Lorentz transformation cannot be derived from fully symmetrical hypotheses, so what does the special relativity theory actually say on this topic?   [[User:Sugdub|Sugdub]] ([[User talk:Sugdub|talk]]) 20:12, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

I) Observer-1 receives the light of the explosion of a firecracker and assesses that the event occurred at a distance x from him/her, at time t on his/her clock. The event is assigned the coordinates (x,t) in the reference frame of observer-1.
II) Observer-2 …. the same firecracker ...   x' …  t' …. (x',t') … reference frame of observer-2.
III) Observer-1 and observer-2 are in relative motion, moving away from each other.
IV) Special relativity concludes that x' is smaller than x.

What is the trigger for this conclusion? I'm not seeking any personal views, but if special relativity  has any relevance to science, physicists must have a good reason for reaching this conclusion better than the opposite one. Or do they play it heads and tails? With this explanation the article will improve a lot.[[User:Sugdub|Sugdub]] ([[User talk:Sugdub|talk]]) 21:15, 17 November 2011 (UTC)

::To Sugdub: 'Special relativity' does not decide anything; it is just a theory not a person. Ask yourself the same questions about two observers in classical physics, say with one on a train and one on the ground. The asymmetry is not in the theory; it is in the factual situation in which the observers find themselves. Notice that observers who are first approaching one another will after a time be moving away from one another, assuming that neither accelerates. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 01:53, 17 November 2011 (UTC)

Of course the theory must build-up on a difference in the respective experimental conditions of the observers in order to conclude that x' is smaller than x. So for the example of the firecracker proposed in the article, which parameter of the experimental conditions for observer-1 is assumed having a different value in the experimental conditions for observer-2 ? If you don't know the answer, just let physicists explain how their theory works. This is precisely the purpose of this article.[[User:Sugdub|Sugdub]] ([[User talk:Sugdub|talk]]) 21:15, 17 November 2011 (UTC)

:In special relativity, the observers determine the time and position of an event in just the same way that they would in classical physics, using measuring rods and clocks, geometry, photographs, tape measures or chains, [[theodolite]]s, etc.. (Except if their equipment moves relative to the spatial origin of their system, then they must compensate for the time dilation or Lorentz contraction of the equipment, just as they have to compensate for effects due to temperature and humidity of the air.) [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 06:42, 18 November 2011 (UTC)

It seems you didn't catch the issue at stake. We are dealing with a section in the article which suggests that the relative motion between two observers is the key explanation of their difference of appreciation of their respective distance to a material target (e.g. a firecracker). This does not make sense since: i) it implies that the measurement performed by one observer gets impacted by the  measurement performed by another observer; ii) it does not provide any criterion for deciding which observer will find the larger value; iii) one can easily produce a counter example showing that it contradicts the principle of isotropy of space (e.g. two observers moving away from the firecracker in opposite directions at the same time and the same constant speed v/2 will receive the light of the firecracker at the same time after it has exploded and will therefore assess the same distance for the firecracker, being exposed to fully identical experimental conditions thanks to the principle of isotropy of space; however, since both observers are in relative motion to each other, special relativity will - according to this article - predict that they will find different values for their distance to the firecracker, although it is unable to predict which observer will find the larger value).

This can be expressed in a very synthetic way: if the relative motion between two observers could be seen as a proof that they are exposed to different experimental conditions, then the absolute velocity of each observer would be an objective physical quantity of its own, in full contradiction with the principle of relativity set by Einstein.

It is difficult to accept the idea that the sense of logic by physicists is so ill-fated as it would look like if the presentation displayed in this article actually reflected their theory. So let's see if physicists have something consistent to offer concerning the genuine cause of the phenomenon, in order to counteract this disastrous image. If not, every reader of this page will be free to draw his/her own conclusions ...[[User:Sugdub|Sugdub]] ([[User talk:Sugdub|talk]]) 20:33, 20 November 2011 (UTC)
:I've found that the mentally easiest way to see all this is something like Einstein's thought experiment with trains, lightning and embankments, except that we update it for things we're familiar with, like strobe-flashes and atom bombs and spaceships. We begin with an "infernal device" which is simply two strobes at the end of a 600 meter rigid rod, floating in space. Exactly midway on the rod (300 m from each strobe) we put a electric eye looking at both strobes, and an atom bomb (and an astronaut in a spacesuit, or a cat in a Shroedinger box or whatever). We synch the strobes so that they flash each second, in a way that their signals travel 300 m to reach the center at exactly the same time, which is (of course) 1 microsecond = 1000 ns after they flash. After we have all this rigged up, we set a trigger so that if either signal arrives even 1 ns early or late, the bomb explodes. Then, we just let the whole thing run and watch how everybody has to view it. <p> Now, if we take the atom bomb and rod as being the "rest frame" we see that the strobes must flash very closely at the same time (simultaneously) if the signals are to reach the middle simultaneously, and the bomb not go off. Thus, the strobe events/flashes are simultaneous in this frame. But what about other frames? For these, you can either have the rod move through space, or you can have somebody fly by the rod. The first is where we find out if there is an ether, for if we did this experiment with sound and air, as soon as the thing started to move through the air, one signal would arrive ahead of the other and the bomb would blow up. So we'd have a motion detector. Also an aether detector, since such a device would also show if the wind was blowing (some windgauges actually work like that). Let us suppose that all such experiments fail with light. Thus, we have no way to detect absolute motion, and no way to detect aether winds or aether-drift. <p> For the problem with simultaneity, it's easy to see that even for the person riding the rod-ship that the strobes mush flash at the same time, even if the rods contract in both directions, since the speed of light is constant, so the distances (even if short) must be the same, and the arrival-time cannot change. However, just as clearly, a person flying by the rod in such a way as to arrive at the mid-point just as the signals arrive, CANNOT see the bomb go off either (it cannot both go off and not go off). So if the arrival "event" (the bomb not blowing up) is seen in one frame, it must be seen in all fames AT THAT SPOT (where the bomb is). You can call it a non-event (since nothing happens) but actually it's an event because the signals have to arrive at the middle at the same time (or within 1 ns) in all frames, and that simultaneous arrival is our "event". However, that causes a problem for moving frames. Suppose an astronaut flies by the bomb in the direction of the rod, at a velocity of 3000 m/sec. He sees the pulses arrive at the same time, but he knows that in the millisecond the pulses are traveling, the rod has moved 3 mm and so the light from the trailing flash has 3 mm extra to move, and the light from the forward flash has 3 mm less distance to cover. Thus, the two flashes cannot be emitted at the same time if the flashes arrive simultaneously, although the time difference is only that required for light to cross 3 mm, which is 3e-3/3e8 = 1e-11 sec = 1/100 ns. <p> But now you see the problem, as already our arrivals are not QUITE simultaneous, and moving the observer to a frame 100 times faster (300 km/sec = 3e5 m/sec = c/1000) gets us into real trouble with the (arbitrary) way we set the sensitivity of our photoelectric detonation device. Now, at the faster speed of c/1000 the rod moves 0.3 m while the pulses are in motion, and one arrives 1 ns early and the other 1 ns late if they are emitted at the same time. This is enough to blow up the bomb and we can't have that, since all we did was move the observer. To preserve the observer's observation that the pulses arrive at the same time (and qualitatively, that the bomb doesn't explode just as he flys by it), the trailing strobe must emit 2 nanosec before the forward one! So these distant events are simultaneous for the observer riding on the rod along with the bomb, but they CANNOT be for the observer in the same spot (flying by the bomb very close to it-- infinitely close to it), but moving at 300 km/sec with respect to it. That's special relativity. The moving observer figures that for what he sees to be true, the forward clock and strobe are running behind his time, by an offset amount equal to t-t' = Δt = vd/c^2 = 3e5*3e2 / (3e8)^2 = 1 ns. A similar thing happens to the trailing clock which must be running fast by 1 ns and emits 1 ns early, because of this. Note also that time-dilation and length-contraction are not important in this problem, as we're only going c/1000. So forget getting involved with calculating the clock RATES and the rod LENGTHS.  They change according to the usual Lorentz formula and get multiplied in, but not enough to affect the principal result, which is the clock offset (not clock rate) which requires that non-co-local events (the two strobe flashes) not be simultaneous in a "moving" frame if they are simultaneous in a "rest" frame. Only events at the same physical spot in both frames (like the arrival of the pulses at the electric eye and the bomb not exploding) can happen at the same time and place in both frames. All other events at distance, have to be "offset" by vd/c^2 to make it all come out. So you can see easily where that factor comes from, even if we don't have the gamma factor to contend with (which we don't in this example, where the speeds are too slow to need it). <p> Note also the odd affect that if the observer goes past the bomb in the OTHER direction, he sees the clock times synch reverse, and the clock that was slow now runs fast, and vice-versa. He has no way to decide which is the "truth" since the clocks snap back into synch every time he matches velocities with them.

== Equivalence of mass and energy: is it advisable to perpetuate this phrasing? ==

The section [[Special_relativity#Consequences]] contains a sentence beginning "Equivalence of mass and energy". Although this is a common description, would it not be more accurate to say "Relation between mass and energy" or some other wording? After all, mass and energy are not two separate but somehow "equivalent" properties, but are related to a four vector [p<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>3</sub>] with p<sub>0</sub>=mc<sup>2</sup>&gamma;.  The idea in using this description probably is that it is "popular" (and was used even by Einstein in several different ways that have proven confusing). Even so, a better description should be introduced immediately following this popular header. This recommendation applies also to the subsection titled [[Theoretical_total_mass-energy#Mass.E2.80.93energy_equivalence_2|Mass-energy equivalence]] and to the article [[Mass–energy equivalence]] that appear to perpetuate this misleading description as well. [[User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]] ([[User talk:Brews ohare|talk]]) 19:21, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

:I don't see why you think it misleading. Give something energy and you give it mass. E.g. heat something or accelerate something to give it thermal or kinetic energy and it gains mass. Extract energy from something and it loses mass: burn it, or extract energy through fission or fusion, and the energy you extract exactly equals the mass lost. Annihilate an electron and positron and 100% of their mass becomes energy. Whether we can measure the change in mass is another question but always if energy is gained then mass is lost, with the quantities related by the formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 06:53, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

::The relativistic mass is the energy divided by ''c''<sup>2</sup>. The rest mass is the relativistic mass in the co-moving frame of reference. Inertia is a side effect of the conservation of energy and momentum together with 
:::<math>E = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} \,</math>
:::<math>\mathbf{p} c^2 = E \mathbf{v} \,.</math>
::So it seems to me that saying that mass and energy are equivalent is quite justified. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 18:32, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

:::Indeed, energy and mass are both scalars, just with different units. However, they are interconverable with a c^2. The fact that invariant mass is the length of a 4-vector and relativistic mass is not, only means they are two different kinds of mass. Invariant mass is equivalent of the rest energy (or system energy in the COM frame). Relativistic mass is the equivalent of relativistic energy (total energy). It's only when we try to cross relativistic THIS with invariant THAT, that we have problems with these 4 quantities. They are not all equivalent, except in the COM frame. But there's a pair of E,m that are equivalent for whatever situation you like. <math>E = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} \,</math> is just the way of converting relativistic E to rest mass, and so on. These aren't equivalent. It's only the m and E with the proper TAGS that are equivalent (except in the special COM case, again, where all four E(rel), m(rel), E(rest) and m(rest/invariant) are equivalent, save for units).

== How long does it take...? ==

I changed the section.  It had one egregiously confusing error in calling traveler's proper time 'subjective'.  Technically it is correct, but for the lay-person it implies "not objective" rather than "as experienced".  You need to know your audience. I added some examples of round-trip durations and distances using the equations garnered from here:http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/specialrelativity/TravelDilation.html, but available in numerous on-line and text book sources.  Please clean-up, I tend to be too verbose.  I did NOT remove, although I feel it SHOULD be removed, the sentence on 4-velocity.  I think it completely confusing and irrelevant: divide the trip's distance as seen from Earth by time as seen by him? Apples and Oranges.  It does not advance the article one iota, IMHO.[[Special:Contributions/71.31.149.105|71.31.149.105]] ([[User talk:71.31.149.105|talk]]) 08:05, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

== Question ==

Based on my incredibly limited exposure, study and knowledge of simple physics, 
I humbly submit questions related to the concept that atoms are 99.9999 percent 
empty space. Is it possible that the incredible gravitational forces found in 
exotic matter such as a black hole could compress an atom of any given element 
to near 0 percent empty space? If possible, could this account for any of the 
'missing' visible universe? Based upon my exposure to quantum theory, I must 
challenge some of the paradoxes associated with Relativity and Quantum Theory. 
Firstly, they cannot be unified as Electricity and Magnetism. They are incompatible. 
Where Relativity precisely describes celestial mechanics, its formulas fail utterly 
when applied to the subatomic world of quantum mechanics. The converse is true for 
quantum theory. However precisely, beautifully and accurately the formulas of quantum 
theory describe the very strange world of microscopic matter they too utterly fail 
if applied to larger matter. Where they meet and essentially leave humanity in the 
'dark' is where both theories must be applied to attempt ANY understanding of a black 
holes exotic state and properties. I theorize (foolishly) that when a black hole is 
formed in the implosion of a supermassive star, elements are created that have not been 
observed by any scientific discipline. That is to say, yes, I believe fusion ends when 
a star produces iron but, without this implosion, we may not even have black holes in 
our universe as we understand it. Ok, my point: Could the 'infinate' gravity of a black 
hole drastically and in fact completely squeeze the empty space from each and every atom 
consumed by the black hole? If so, wouldn't that then mean that the potential energy of 
each atom is released as energy in it's purest form, electrons? Even tho light isn't 
supposed to have the capability to escape the gravitational force of this celestial 
body, Hawking radiation does escape. It is this readers humble opinion that the potential 
energy of each atom consumed by a black hole is released as pure energy as postulated 
by Albert Einstien and described by Steven Hawking (hawking radiation)? This leads me 
to a troubling question: Example:

Consider the atomic weights of each element and its' corrisponding atomic number. If a black
hole compresses and overcomes the other 3 fundemental laws of physics: electromagnetism, 
the weak and strong nuclear forces, could one atom distinguish itself from another? 
Practical excersise: if one iron atom contains 63 protons and 64 neutrons totalling 
107 (for arguments sake, I will plug the actual numbers in later) wouldn't 64 hydrogen 
atoms then be equally as heavy as the single iron atom? Each hydrogen atom contains 
one each proton and neutron. Should the space of these atoms be compressed to the 
forces applied by the 'infinate' state of a black hole, would they then weigh the 
same. If any given proton or any given neutron weighs the same dispite the atom it 
composes, and those weak and strong nuclear forces have been overwhelmed, it seems 
to make sense that the gravitational force is therefore NOT infinate but, in DIRECT 
proportion with the number of protons and neutrons which have been consumed by the 
black hole that trapped it.

Having scratched this surface, I find myself now contemplating Potential Energy 
and its counterpart, 
(precise name unknown) 'actual energy - heat and light' and certainly not limited 
to the frequency densities of the spectrum that human eyes can detect or human skin 
to feel. This energy released by the black hole could account for the missing Mass 
of the universe simply by applying Ensteins formula E=MC2 he states that energy is 
matter. The IMMENSE amount of energy released by a black hole should therefore 
eventually cool and spontaneously produce matter as we know it in the periodic table. 
This 'Dark energy' would then eliminate some fundamental paradoxes as predicted by 
both relativity and quantum theory. The energy we cannot detect could manifest and 
become the matter that in turn we cannot detect because it exists as pure energy.

== Time Dilation & Length Contraction - Correct Expressions ==

Hi all, 

I'm surprised to find some, lets say subtle, but critical to this article... I was unable to leave this that way.

Time dilation and Length contraction expressions are incorrect. Im based on the same topic, but taken from specialized books on the particle acceleration physics topic, which as review always present some physics summary. In particular, taken from [1, p.91]

In the section 'Time Dilation', it is customary to derive the formula: t=\gamma t', not the expression indicated in the article (t' = \gamma t) which is incorrect and lead to misinterpretations. 

Several specialized books used the expression t = \gamma t', where is also customary to refer S' as the "moving" box, and S' as the "static" space. In this case, you use the expression: ct = \gamma ( ct' + \beta x' ) and not the inverse expression ct' = \gamma ( ct - \beta x ). 

The mistake arises by considering x = 0 for proving time dilation. The correct assumption is to consider x'=0, that is, there is no displacement inside the moving S' box.
This leads to the correct expression.

Here are the correction.

===== Correction on Time Dilation Expressions =====

The Time Dilation can be proved by taking the S' moving box transformation: ct = \gamma ( ct' + \beta x' ).
Consider you 'lived' an interval t' inside the S' moving box.
For simplicity, take two instants 'lived' at the same position under the S' moving box frame, that is, x'=0. 

Hence, the interval at the S static space frame is:
ct = \gamma ( ct' + \beta 0)
t=\gamma t'.

Being \gamma > 1 for high speeds, for example lets say \gamma=3, means: 
1 year living in the moving box is equivalent to 3 years living in the static space frame.
This is the "twin paradox".

===== Correction on Length Contraction Expressions =====

Similarly, the Length Contraction can be proved by taking the S static space transformation: x' = \gamma ( -\beta ct + x ). 
Again, consider you 'measured' a distance x' inside the S' moving box.
In this case, for simplicity, take two positions 'measured' at a same time under the S static space frame, that is, t=0.

Hence, the distance at the S static space frame is:
x' = \gamma ( -\beta 0 + x ). 
x = 1/\gamma x'

Again, for example lets say \gamma=3, means: 
a 1 m rod measured in the moving box is equivalent to a 1/3 m rod measured in the static space frame.


Thanks to all,

:It all depends on in which frame of reference the clock and ruler are taken at rest.
:In our article we have the clock and rod '''at rest in the unprimed frame''' and the effects are measured in the '''primed''' frame, such that the clock is at same place in the '''unprimed''' frame, and the rod's ends are measured simultaneously in the '''primed''' frame:

:: Thanks for your answer, now i can see the corrected expression. They are now shown correct. As note of standardization, i would suggest to use ''primed'' coordinates for the 'moving box' frame, proper coordinates, and let the ''unprimed'' coordinates for the 'static space' frame, laboratory coordinates. This is also consistent with four-vectors and tensorial notation.
:: Please, also note the Time Dilation and Lorentz Contraction expressions cannot be equal!. they should be symmetrical, as shown. I've found several other -even specialized- references where it is no differences, and put x=\gamma x' and t=\gamma t'.
:: I've note also some inconsistencies on the 'Lorentz Contraction' article. Here both the ''sub-zero'' notation for proper coordinates and the ''primed'' notation are introduced, at some places they are even mixed. If you are also in charge of these pages, please make the proper corrections ( i could make them too, but could be interfering your work).

== Special relativity (alternative formulations) ==

I would like to draw attention to the article [[Special relativity (alternative formulations)]]. It's of very poor quality and is not linked to from any other article. I posted in its talk page my reasons for thinking that it should be deleted. I haven't started an AFD process for it because I'm not active enough on WP to want to invest the time in that process.--[[Special:Contributions/75.83.64.6|75.83.64.6]] ([[User talk:75.83.64.6|talk]]) 01:35, 23 February 2013 (UTC)
== Journal articles ==

This section is goofy. Unless I'm missing something, the article doesn't seem to explicitly state any connection between these papers and the contents of the article. Some of the papers are good and well known, e.g., the one by Alvager, which is a test of SR -- but it's unclear why these particular papers are referenced. Others appear to be fringe papers published in low-quality journals. I'm going to delete several of the most obviously low-value papers. IMO the whole section serves no purpose and should be deleted as well.--[[Special:Contributions/75.83.76.23|75.83.76.23]] ([[User talk:75.83.76.23|talk]]) 02:11, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
:I agree with the general plan. Sources supporting specific material in the article should be connected to that material via an inline citation. In cases where the topic of the source is not described in this article moving the reference to a more specialized article might be appropriate. Remaining general references could go to a "Further reading" section. At the moment it looks like each of the general sources supports the whole article, which is surely not the case.
:@Maschen: A source being outdated is ''by itself'' indeed no reason for removal. But in this case the reason given was that there are already better sources supporting the same material, with ''better'' being defined as less outdated and more on-topic. To me that seems to justify removal. That said, since we're dealing with general references here, one should check if there's anything in the article that's not covered by the other sources and requires an inline citation to MTW. &mdash;&thinsp;[[User:Hhhippo|<font color="darkblue" face="times">'''H<small>HHIPPO</small>'''</font>]] 09:56, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

::Well it never hurts to keep as further reading... Anyway the section [[Special relativity#Comparison between flat Euclidean space and Minkowski space|Comparison between flat Euclidean space and Minkowski space]] already mentions MTW (the authors, not just the book) in the context of the metric - why replace that? There is no reference for the section [[Special relativity#Invariance|Invariance]] (OK plenty of refs could be found for this). But they also emphasize that the Lorentz force law is the "predictor of motions and definer of fields", leading to the definition of the field strength tensor by inspection, and again there is no reference for [[Special relativity#Relativity and unifying electromagnetism|Relativity and unifying electromagnetism]], which could include this detail. 

::In any case I dislike the idea of removing a classic book written by three of the greatest 20th century theoretical physicists, more generally of those who make/made considerable contributions to knowledge academically (even just by writing well-written texts) because this makes them and their work ''less known'' in a main, central, and popular article like this one. Shall we ''replace'' the Landau and Lifshitz [[course of Theoretical Physics]] and [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] books replaced by other modern refs in the relevant articles too?

:::I think there's two separate points here: the use of sources to establish verifiability of an article and the notability of sources by themselves. You actually found an inline citation to MTW, so it should indeed stay in the reference section. Maybe we should improve the formatting and clarify the connection by using a cite template. The same for the other references: some of them might be unlinked inline citations rather than general references.
:::Regarding notability of sources: that book is definitely notable by itself, it even deserves and has it's own article (which should be linked here btw). I wasn't sure how far it is relevant for an article on ''Special'' relativity (don't have the book here right now), but the passage you mentioned is clarifying that as well.
:::So yes, keep MTW. While the quoted reason for removal would in principle be valid, the situation it describes is not given here. &mdash;&thinsp;[[User:Hhhippo|<font color="darkblue" face="times">'''H<small>HHIPPO</small>'''</font>]] 14:00, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
Maschen reverted my entire edit, which included both the removal of MTW and the removal of three journal articles. AFAICT the only controversial issue is MTW, so I'm undoing the revert of the journal articles while leaving MTW in. Maschen, please look more carefully at an edit before reverting it, and please pay attention to discussion on the talk page before reverting.--[[Special:Contributions/75.83.76.23|75.83.76.23]] ([[User talk:75.83.76.23|talk]]) 14:04, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

== Discussion of Postulates ==

The section on the postulates of Special Relativity seems to need some rethinking.  In section 1 of his original 1905 paper Einstein states the first postulate as "The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are unaffected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of coordinates in uniform translatory motion." The second postulate states the invariance of the speed of light. These seem clear enough and we expect that the Lorentz transformation will be derived from them. In Section 3 he derives the Lorentz transformation from two postulates, first that the speed of light is invariant and second that the relation between the observers is symmetrical. There is no mention of the invariance of physical laws; the invariance of the speed of light gets as far as the LT with an arbitrary constant multiplier, and the symmetry postulate settles its value as unity. In section 6, Electrodynamical Part, he shows that the equations of electrodynamics are invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation just derived, so the laws of physics may be a consequence of the LT but are not used as a postulate. This seems to be a very common mistake; none of the derivations of the LT I have seen use the invariance of physical laws as a postulate.ColinG 03:53, 26 April 2013 (UTC)

:To {{user|Colingordon}}: The invariance of physical laws is needed to show that everything in physics (not just electromagnetism) is preserved by Lorentz transformations. It is not the derivation of LT that requires the full power of the first postulate, rather it is the application of LT which requires that full power.

::Even though some authors quoted round-trip and others one-way, can someone convert all of one to the other, or simply remove some of them?  Maybe drop the round-trip examples; It's interesting enough that one could reach andromeda in one's lifetime, regardless of whether you (or your children) come back.  Coming back is different because you'd be coming back to an earth that had aged hundreds of millions of years, in which time humans had presumably evolved into god-knows-what or gone extinct.

==Time, Proper time, and Standard time==
It is useful to understand the mutual relation between the above-mentioned three closely related quantities, time, proper time, and standard time, more closely, which may be relevant for this article, at least it may be helpful for understanding:

As I see it at present, the standard time is defined by the "[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]" of the country in question, ideally as the proper time of a certain free-falling atom (i.e. the velocity is exactly compensated by the local gravity forces, see [[General Relativity]]). The corresponding "ticks" of this time correspond to the periods of the corresponding quantum radiation of this atom. 

This standard time is then propagated from the institute to railway stations, airports, and elsewhere. Finally this standard time also corresponds to the time of the watches, the passengers of Einstein's "fast trains", or  "fast aircrafts", may carry on their arms, if they are sitting at rest on their seats in the vehicle. In particular this standard time, ideally also the time presented by the watches, corresponds to Einstein's <math>\mathrm dt ,</math> i.e. to the (external) clocks on the platforms of the railway station, and not to the (internal) "proper time" <math>\mathrm d\tau</math> of the well-seated passengers in the train or airplane. In fact, a re-standardization from <math>\mathrm dt</math> to the last-mentioned <math>\mathrm d\tau ,</math> according to <math>\mathrm d\tau =\mathrm dt\sqrt{1-(v^2/c^2)} ,</math> would show only  a slightly lower result, corresponding to some kind of [[Hafele-Keating experiment]], since <math>v\ll c.</math>  But for <math>v\to c</math> the internal quantity <math>\mathrm d\tau</math> would diverge according to <math>\gamma .</math><br><br>

:{{ping|Xinhangshen}} and {{ping|W2einstein}}, you may actually be delusional. 
:SR and GR have been tested over and over, with very accurate results, from particle physics experiments to interplanetary spacecraft.  Of course GR will break down at some point, and in the future some new theory will replace it to include GR plus the new corrections and predictions. No theory can be truly correct.
:But SR ''can'' allow acceleration and even rotations and angular momentum (see for example [[relativistic mechanics]]), this is '''not''' the same as gravitation, which corresponds to curvature of spacetime and motion along geodesics. SR places inertial and non-inertial frames on different footing and accelerations are absolute, GR places all frames on equal footing and accelerations are relative. There is no contradiction in having time dilation either since coordinate time is relative. SR applies to any moving objects when gravity is negligible.

The adjective "classical" is often used to mean "[[Galilean relativity|nonrelativistic]]" (equivalent to ''c'' → ∞) and/or "assuming the nonquantum limit (''ħ'' → 0), but ''not always both''.  The article [[Classical mechanics]] assumes Galilean relativity; and [[Classical electromagnetism]] assumes the nonquantum limit but it assumes special relativity. I'd suggest therefore that either use of the the term "classical" must be disambiguated within the article for each word to which it is applied, or it should be replaced. —[[User_talk:Quondum|Quondum]] 15:53, 2 August 2014 (UTC)

== Citations, Quality and Personal Theories ==

Firstly, this article seems to a little light on citations considering its assertions; for example, the intro para makes the following assertion without any references: "The inconsistency of Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and the inability to discover Earth's motion through a luminiferous aether led to the development of special relativity". In the following section it says something a little different: "There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment.". The current reference list runs to about 45 sources, which is not the longest by any means, so I propose that we back up each assertion (or group of assertions if applicable) with a citation.

Secondly, the current status is "Delisted good article". Is there any guidance available as why is was delisted, or what work is required to be done to improve the article?

Thirdly, this really should be an encyclopedic article summarising current scientific consensus; so should Talk be a place to discuss personal beliefs or presentation of critiques of the theory? (as opposed to critiques of the article?)

If any of the more experienced editors would like to comment on these points and/or provide some guidance, then I would be happy to contribute to the maintenance of this article.

==Distinction between SR and GR==
The lead included an antiquated and incorrect description of the distinction between SR and GR. Einstein originally believed that the relevant generalization was from inertial to noninertial frames of reference. This is not the way any professional relativist or any GR textbook has defined the distinction for many decades. It has been known for many decades that SR is perfectly capable of handling accelerated frames of reference and arbitrary coordinate systems, and that doing so does not lead to a theory of gravity. The distinction universally agreed upon by modern relativists is that SR deals with flat spacetime, GR with curved spacetime. I've fixed the error in the lead, and I've added references to two standard textbooks on GR, one by Carroll and one by Wald. (The reference to Carroll is to the shorter online version of the book.)--[[Special:Contributions/76.169.116.244|76.169.116.244]] ([[User talk:76.169.116.244|talk]]) 20:02, 14 August 2015 (UTC)

== Time dilation description seams unclear ==

It says:
<blockquote>To find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, the first equation can be used to find:
    Δt' = γΔt for events satisfying Δx = 0 .
</blockquote>

How can there be a time dilation without movement between the two events? It seams it would make more sense to define x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> as being separated by some distance (say x<sub>1</sub>=0 meters and x<sub>2</sub>=1 meter); and also have t<sub>1</sub>=0 seconds (start) and t<sub>2</sub>=1 second.

It needs a basic explanation that is absolutely missing.  How it compares with Newtonian physics in simple cases. 

Sure, this is a sophisticated idea that cannot be introduced trivially.  But it should be intelligible to someone with high school physics, at least.  The article does not even make an attempt.

I am a teacher (not a researcher, but with 21 refereed pubs) who was trying to find the best way to explain how superluminal communication  violates causality (as you might guess, I also like science fiction).  I realized if we simplify the question to instantaneous communication, the space-time diagram is much simpler, as shown in figure 1 above.  I realize the image of moving train is not a "proper" thing to do in a space-time diagram, but the entire area between the F and R lines is the history of this one-dimensional line segment, and figure 2 reflects this fact.  I was not allowed to insert figure 1 into [[Superluminal communication]] because it was declared new research (which I hope it is).  So my question is this:

'''''Has anybody seen a diagram like this used to explain the "impossibility" of superluminal communication'''''?

== About Lorentz shortening ==

Einstein writes in the article "To Ehrenfest paradox": ''"The question of whether the Lorentz contraction is real or not, it makes no sense. Reduction is not realistic, because it does not exist for an observer moving with the body; however, it is real, since it can be proved for the observer who is not moving with the body."'' (Zum Ehrenfestschen. Phys.Z., 1911, 12, 169). This statement can be clearly demonstrated in the model of the special  relativity, see below :
{{Hider|

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Model of special relativity is a system of two observers and two rods (Figure 1a).

[[File:Model of special relativity.gif|thumb|right|300px|<center>Model of special relativity</center>]]
Here <math>AB</math> and <math>A\,'B\,'</math> - rods with a length <math>l_{\,0}</math>. At points <math>D</math> and <math>D\,'</math> are observers. <math>R</math> - permanent distance, <math>R_1</math> - variable distance. Thus, each observer associated with a respective rod (own reference system indicated in red or blue). From Figure 1a is easy to obtain equations that are valid with respect to both observers
:<center><math>l\,'=l_{\,0}\left (1-\frac{R_1}{R}\right )\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)</math></center>
:<center><math>\tan\alpha '=\frac{\tan\alpha}{1-{R_1}/{R}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(2)</math></center>
:<center><math>R \tan\alpha=\tan\alpha'(R-R_1)=invariant\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(3)</math></center>
Suppose that the light signal travels from point <math>A</math> to point <math>B</math> and returns to the point <math>A</math>. Then the formula (1), (2), (3) will have the form
:<center><math>l\,' = l_{\,0} \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(4)</math></center>
:<center><math>\Delta t\,' = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(5)</math></center>
:<center><math>c\Delta t_0 = {c\,'}\Delta t\,' = {(c^2 - v^2)}^{1/2} \Delta t\,' = {(c^2\Delta{t\,'}^2 - \Delta{x'}^2)}^{1/2} = \Delta S=invariant\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(6)</math></center>
Here <math>l\,'</math> is a projection of the light beam on the rod <math>A'B'</math>; <math>\Delta t_0=2\tan\alpha (R/c)</math> and <math>\Delta t\,'=2\tan\alpha ' (R/c)</math> is times of the light signal forth and back; <math>c</math> is speed of light; <math>\Delta S</math> is invariant.

Formulas (4), (5) and (6) are similar to the formulas of special relativity. Therefore all the conclusions of special relativity clearly displayed in the model.

== Edit request: lede is factually wrong. ==

The lead contains the following false claim:"As of today, special relativity is the most accurate model of motion at any speed."
It should be obvious that for macroscopic motion (that is, where.when quantum mechanics isn't needed) that GENERAL relativity is the "most accurate model of motion" (at all possible speeds).[[Special:Contributions/71.29.172.222|71.29.172.222]] ([[User talk:71.29.172.222|talk]]) 15:39, 3 July 2016 (UTC)

:{{not done}}.

* I agree that it is factually wrong.  For example, the motion of a very heavy body in the neighbourhood of another very heavy body is not correctly predicted by special relativity, whereas it is correctly predicted by general relativity.  An example would be two neutron stars.  Hence special relativity is less accurate than general relativity in this case, meaning that special relativity is not the most accurate model of motion.

== Measurement versus visual appearance ==

Triggered by recent edits ... While I have no (perceived) problem in the original, probably terse version of identifying the "measured shape" of an object as a collection of 3d-space-coordinates, obtained from a section of spacetime coordinates, and appropriately associated to corresponding object-inherent coordinates, revealing the length contraction in the direction of the velocity, I am unsure about the term "snapshot" in the current version. I think "snapshot" is "taking a picture", and induces inherently propagation of light, which is carefully excluded in "observing", i.e. taking spacetime coordinates.

I must admit that the notion of "visual appearance" is a bit bewildering to me in both versions. I think this is now about taking a "snapshot", which involves a central projection, including dependencies on distance between the object and the observer, the direction of the velocity, and what not.

I think that the presented material is excellent, but the presentation is not fully rigorous and sufficiently explicative, and I am unsure, whether the edits constitute an improvement. 12:29, 10 September 2018 (UTC)

== Rearranging the sections, and now I'm stuck ==

I've been rearranging the sections of this article so as to put them into a more rational order, and now I'm stuck.

There are a variety of approaches to teaching relativity:
* The dominant approach found in most college textbooks is begin with the "two postulates" (almost always starting with a stronger, less intuitive form of the second postulate than that adopted by Einstein in his 1905 paper) and to proceed through relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction etc. to the Lorentz transformations. While traditional, this principle-based approach has many issues. As [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.0902.pdf Miller] has noted, "Teaching STR that way is especially problematic because, unlike the case of classical thermodynamics which is also taught as a principle theory, the two postulates or principles in the case of STR are strongly counterintuitive when taken together." 
* Several textbooks begin with Minkowski spacetime as the central focus, often approaching Minkowski spacetime through constructive arguments. This, for instance, is the approach adopted by Taylor & Wheeler's ''Spacetime Physics''. The article [[Spacetime]] attempts consistently to follow this approach, how successfully, I'm not sure.
* Some authors advocate beginning with the Lorentz transformations as the first principle. I know of '''''no''''' introductory college textbook that teaches special relativity this way.

This article starts off as if it were following a two-postulates presentation, and then suddenly switches over to presenting the Lorentz transformations as the first principle, from which everything else derives.

Does this section really provide a comprehensible explanation of why FTL is impossible? All it does is state that "one can show" that causal paradoxes can be constructed.

: It makes sense to me. It explains how FTL travel would violate causality. There’s no proof of causality but it’s intuitively very appealing as without causality paradoxes arise, so is widely accepted as being true. And if you accept causality then FTL travel must be impossible.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 03:47, 29 October 2018 (UTC)
:: I restored the section, but I still don't like it. At the very least, it needs a second Minkowski diagram showing how, through the exchange of FTL signals, one can generate a causality-violating scenario. As currently written, it demands an act of faith on the part of the reader. I suppose I could draw the necessary diagram and modify the text to work with the new figure.

:::It’s alright to me. It’s the sort of thing that’s hard to draw as it quickly gets cluttered, but if you’ve looked at enough such diagrams you can visualise it in your head.

::::I suggest to get rid of one spatial dimension in the relevant pic. An (x/t + x'/t')-diagram would do the job (there is already a comment about this in the article text) better than this fancy x/y/t-cone. Maybe it is helpful to hint to the trivial fact that any line in the upper half of the first quadrant through the origin and an arbitrary event represents a t'-axis, with an appropriate x'-axis (symmetrically to x = t), whereas any lines through an event in the lower half can only be an x'-axis, because reverse interpretations have no real solutions within the Lorentz transformation (for the less mathy inclined: there is no meaningful place  to put the respective other axis ).

::::: I was already considering replacing the fancy x-y-t light cone diagram with an x-t diagram.

John makes a good point about how cluttered a spacetime diagram illustrating causality violation can be. Use of color can be helpful, but I have to be careful not to rely too much on color. Also, since we have already established that the article begins with universal Lorentz covariance as the central principle for its development of special relativity, it would be better to show this using the LTs rather than with a spacetime diagram. However, I have to mind [[wp:NOR]].

If you are against colorful descriptions with multi-million dollar lotteries, Sherlock Holmes mysteries, soldiers on tour in Iraq and the like, how about this:

:Consider the spacetime diagrams in Fig.&nbsp;10&#8209;5. A and B stand beside railroad tracks. A high speed train passes by with C riding in the last car of the train and D riding in the leading car. The world lines of A and B are vertical reflecting the stationary position of these observers on the ground, while the world lines of C and D are tilted forwards, reflecting the rapid motion of these observers in the train.
# Fig.&nbsp;10&#8209;5a. B flashes a message to D as the leading car passes by.
# D passes the message back to C using an instantaneous communication device. The signal follows along the <math>x'</math> axis, which is a line of simultaneity between C and D.
# Fig.&nbsp;10&#8209;5b. C flashes the message to A who is standing by the railroad tracks.
# A passes the message forwards to B via the instantaneous communication device. The signal follows along the <math>x</math> axis, which is a line of simultaneity between A and B.

==LT vs. two postulates vs spacetime approaches to understanding SR==

Mathematically, it is '''extremely simple''' to establish the non-existence of a world line from A to C, end of story, no need to go any further. But for most, the pure mathematical demonstration doesn't satisfy the need for an intuitive understanding of why that should be so. That is why I am so unhappy about the decision of the original authors of this article to develop special relativity starting with the single postulate of universal Lorentz covariance. 

The appeal of the two-postulates development of special relativity is how, starting with these intuitive principles, one can arrive at all sorts of fantastic results, including the Lorentz transformation. But many people just don't ''get'' the deductive style of the two-postulates approach. They get lost at the very start trying to understand relativity of simultaneity, and if one gets stuck there, there is no going forwards.

Then there is the spacetime approach, which is frequently taught from a ''constructive'' standpoint through analogies with Euclidean geometry. If you buy the analogies and accept the results of experiment, that is the best approach for many people.

What I am trying to get at is that your reservations seem, '''to me''' anyway, mostly that you are most comfortable with a pure mathematics approach to understanding special relativity, which is why you are so dead set against ''irrelevant particulars'', ''intuition pumps'' etc. You are not a thought experiments sort of guy.

Using the LTs, Fig. 10-5 can be explained in just three lines. Let S and S' be two frames in in standard configuration, and let <math>\text{E}</math> be the event corresponding to the crossing of the B and D world lines. Then <math>\beta = c t_E/x_E = v/c.</math> The event coordinates <math>(x_E, ct_E)</math> in frame S transform to <math>(x_E/\gamma, 0)</math> in frame S'. An instantaneous signal from <math>\text{E}</math> in frame S' intersects <math>(0,0),</math> and an instantaneous signal from the origin intersects <math> (x_E, 0)</math> in frame S, preceding event <math>\text{E}</math> by <math>t_E.</math> This is totally trivial math, but it does not leave me with any sense of satisfaction that I understand what is going on. It's just symbol manipulation. The spacetime diagram, however, is different. I get a visual handle on the transformation that I simply do not get working the symbols. I can '''see''' the effect of increasing the speed of the train, and I understand ''visually'' why even a speed infinitesimally greater than <math>c</math> can result in causality violation. [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 03:22, 2 November 2018 (UTC)

:Your nice interest in my opinion keeps me quite busy these days. :) I start with the most easy comments.
:I frankly admit to be "most comfortable with a pure mathematics approach" (especially as long as the math is simple enough to my abilities), but I strongly refuse not being accessible by thought experiments. Any of the many indirect proofs I valuate much are such (Let blabla, then ..., therefore ¬blabla.), and I often see essential gain in accessibility by affixing a funny hat (''irrelevant particular'') to some entity (Four ''color'' theorem - not very funny, but famous). For reasons given already by elementary formal logic, I am, however, strongly averse to introducing evident antinomies, like ansibles, in any proof of any claim. (Assume "False", then "Anything". &ndash;is a tautology.) I would agree to disproving the existence of ansibles, relying on geometry or LT and causality, but I disallow for calling any disquisition on anything, which involves the use of an ansible, a proof of anything (repeating: ex falso quodlibet). I accept the path, leading from the ''assumption'' of a speed, ''infinitesimally'' (yuck) larger than lightspeed, to violation of causality, but I am in serious doubt, whether this path is easier to describe and(!) to follow, than the attempt of getting familiar with ct'-axes being restricted to the light cone, and x'-axes to the dark cone, converging with increasing speed to the useful limiting case of ct' and x' coinciding along the propagation of light in all frames (with common origin), the ubiquitous simultaneity. Personally, I perceive the introduction of two additional comoving frames as making things more complex (BTW, the Twin paradox in STR gains its life from the ''frame change'' of the twin.)
:The following is less apodictic and more personal: Dealing with verbally formulated principles is a language game, hard to join in non-native languages, so my primary effort is to create formal tools, independent of natural language, applicable also in hard to understand, in counter intuitive, in surprising, ... situations. To me these tools are the LT. I confess getting lost along so called derivations &ndash;often enriched with ''irrelevant particulars, intuition pumps'', and other distracting stuff, just there to hide the leaks or even flaws (like using ansibles!) within logic&ndash; but with the help of LT I am able to overcome my resentments and arrive at a stable understanding(?)/manipulation, reinforcible at any time by some calculation, even of matters like lost simultaneity. (As an aside, I am not sure, if an "intuitive" understanding of "relative simultaneity" is possible, at all.)
:Imho, there is no "Euclidean" geometry in the spacetime diagrams: it's about the ''difference'' of squares and not their ''sum''. The connecting line of two events in these diagrams is quite misleading wrt their spanned spacetime interval. (I recall to have had a hard time myself to get rid of the Euclidean intuition.) E.g.: Summing the two legs in the twin paradox is "shorter" than the direct connection. I would rather fight Euclidean associations within the x/ct-frame than further them.
:As for your second part, I am perfectly aware that neither my scaring efforts nor your discouraging formulations are very invitational to read, but I rather accept frightening hardship than logical disaster. Maybe there is an intuitively viable path from the slopes of the axes representing the speed and its reciprocal, converging at light propagation, where I started with "Naively, some speed above lightspeed ..."? Anyhow, you decided to take your road.

:::It's not the first time while being around in WP that I enjoy disagreement, but it's a rare moment still - thanks. Thanks also for correcting my link; I am sorry not to have checked it myself. I would not have bothered to notify Krea myself, but I understand that it could be considered appropriate, and misspelling the name was certainly inappropriate. Just for completeness sake, I assume that we also disagree about the level, above which even well-written paragraphs in scientific articles are to be removed for being ''not properly sourced''.

== Proposed section revision ==

<strike>The proposed section revision below represents a distinct issue from Purgy's proposed rewording of the opening two paragraphs for greater precision at the cost of lesser clarity, which Purgy considers a good trade-off. '''Hence, this can be deployed separately from any decision regarding Purgy's proposed revisions.'''</strike>

I do have a question about placement. The article as written uses the single postulate of universal Lorentz covariance as its basic starting principle.
* In terms of ''subject matter'', it belongs in '''Other consequences.'''
* However, it uses Minkowski diagrams to perform the demonstration rather than Lorentz transforms. Therefore, in terms of ''presentation'', it belongs in '''Spacetime.''' 

Where should it go? [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 08:27, 1 November 2018 (UTC)

*'''Spacetime''': "No FTL", even when less important, is similarly elementary as contraction and dilation. The current "Other consequences", while certainly worth mentioning, are by no means elementary in the same way. 
:This is not say that I perceive the structure of this article as perfect. The mass-energy-equivalence is most certainly not derived from the LT, what is the difference between "derived" and "other" consequences, the LT takes good care about the whole spacetime-space, ... [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy]] ([[User talk:Purgy Purgatorio|talk]]) 14:38, 1 November 2018 (UTC)
:: OK. I'll keep it there. I could easily have recast the whole argument in terms of the LT, except that would have constituted original research.

Also, it appears that there is plenty of real estate if we want to reinstate the 3-dimensional light cone diagram that was originally Fig.&nbsp;10&#8209;4. Do we want to revert? [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 08:31, 1 November 2018 (UTC)

*'''No revert''': A flat spatial geometry in two dimensions offers no additional effects relevant to the question of FTL, when compared to a one-dimensional geometry. Since any picture is a projection to two spatial dimensions, the thereby induced spatial ambiguities do not pay the rent, and a higher artificial appeal is just cheating. The troubles of staying aware of a temporal dimension with different metric properties being projected to a spatial dimension is sufficiently bewildering.

:: It is not obvious from the figure that a ''slightly'' greater than light-speed signal would lead to paradox. Either I had to draw a new figure, or I had to explain how a revised figure would look.

== I'm going to have to squeeze in an "Introduction to spacetime diagrams" somewhere ==

Although everything in special relativity can be derived from the Lorentz transforms, spacetime diagrams are a highly useful tool for visualization.

The two big elephants in the room are the two sections [[Special relativity#Geometry of spacetime|Geometry of spacetime]] and [[Special relativity#Physics in spacetime|Physics in spacetime]], neither of which were written at a level appropriate for what I deem the prime target audience for this article, high school through lower division college students. The two sections are inadequately sourced, and some of the writing may represent original research. For these reasons, I pushed these sections to the end. I have, however, been exceedingly reluctant to delete them, since technically I have found nothing wrong with them.

Somehow or other, I'm going to have to squeeze in a quick "Introduction to spacetime diagrams", since five spacetime diagrams are used in this article without adequate explanation about how they may be interpreted, and as I continue to edit this article, I may introduce more spacetime diagrams. Yes, there will be redundant overlap with the [[Special relativity#Spacetime|Spacetime]] section, but that seems an unavoidable evil with the article in its current state. (Despite my efforts so far, I personally would rate the article, in its current state, as [[Wikipedia:Content_assessment|C-class]] because it does not meet the "Readers are not left wanting" criterion necessary to meet B-class.)

:Some fringe thoughts, triggered by the above concerns.
:- There is an article [[Minkowski diagram]], a redirect from "spacetime diagram", that also ''does not'' emphasize that the diagrams are just visualizations of the LT.
:- I dispute the general pedagogic value of deriving STR from principles beyond deriving the LT, as well as of a "constructive" approach to STR. E.g., only the most hardcore intuitive physicists develop an intuition of ''squished EM-fields'' and how to express them, imho.
:- WP is not very apt to address a specific cross-section/level-set of its readership, so I would shed some tears over shooting the elephants. Maybe a title, referring to greater advancedness, and leaving them to the end of the article would help, already.
:- Classifying any article with a scientific topic is hard (WP-rules are contradictory, incoherent, rudimetary, ... ''rubbish''). I ''do not'' argue for or against any capital letter: to suggest the worst, let WMF decide. [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy]] ([[User talk:Purgy Purgatorio|talk]]) 10:49, 6 November 2018 (UTC)
:: It is possible to develop STR starting from the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime, treating the LTs as a derived principle. Given the emphasis of '''this''' article, starting with universal Lorentz covariance as the fundamental principle underlying STR, the approach taken by [[Minkowski diagram]] would be completely incorrect. 
:: I fully intend to mention that practical computations in STR usually start with the LTs and/or the fundamental effects immediately derived from the LTs. Minkowski diagrams are most useful as a tool for visualization. They are less useful as a tool for computation. 
:: Spacetime diagrams will be treated as derived from the LTs. I intend only a bare minimum introduction, with wikilinks to other articles developing them in greater detail. Thanks for the reference to [[Minkowski diagram]], by the way!
:: Shuttling legacy and/or limited-interest advanced topics beyond freshman-sophomore college level to the end and clearly labeling them as "advanced" is the strategy employed in a variety of articles on Wikipedia. For example, see [[Quadratic equation#Advanced topics]] and [[Spacetime#Technical topics]]. Rather than euthanization, that would probably be my choice of what to do with these sections, except that [[Special relativity#Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light]] is not an advanced topic. This section should not be caged with the others. It needs a separate home. 
:: [[Special_relativity#Consequences derived from the Lorentz transformation]] and [[Special_relativity#Other consequences]] are illogical separations of topic. I'm thinking of the following reorganization, taking some inspiration from Rindler:
::: Kinematics: RoS, TD, LC, Thomas rotation, causality and prohibition of FTL  
::: Optical effects: Doppler, measurement vs visual appearance
::: Dynamics: mass-energy equivalence, how far can one travel
:: That allows me to cage the two old beasts separately from the others. I can only do this reorganization after developing the "Introduction to spacetime diagrams" section, because of how much use both the RoS and Causality sections make of spacetime diagrams.
:: Different people learn differently. Constructive and deductive approaches are both important.

== Doubting ... ==

I am disturbed about the last preparatory edits. I did not like the previous setting either, but I sense further blurring.

- The transformation equations do not relate arbitrary 'measurements', but strictly ''spacetime coordinates''. Hopefully, the measurements are 'covariant', and the appropriately formulated laws of physics confirm this. 

- May I suggest to get rid of the "relatively moving observers", at least in new edits? I see an effort to introduce a "standard frame", that is exactly ''the observer'' (at rest!) and his frame. It is ''this frame'', in which ''further'' frames move and can be said to move relatively wrt each other. (I tried to emphasize this less ambiguous POV in my last edit of a caption). Referring to an ''observer'' in one of these further frames, makes this frame the new ''standard frame'', in which coordinates wrt the former standard frame are calculated via the inverse LT of the LT transforming from the old standard to the new (embarrassing).

- It should be made explicit that the parallel orientation of the spatial axes and the orientation of the velocity along the x-axis is a simplifying assumption. (I would not dig deep in the hyperbolic rotation, imho applicable only under this restriction.)

- BTW, what is the origin in spacetime diagrams? Is it the spatial origin, only? Does it make sense to talk about "whereabouts" of an origin at some time?

Just noise from the off. [[User:Purgy Purgatorio|Purgy]] ([[User talk:Purgy Purgatorio|talk]]) 08:24, 8 November 2018 (UTC)

: I made some changes in the wording. 
: Re your other comment, I thought I was ''already'' being very explicit that use of standard configuration represents a simplifying assumption, which with care would allow simpler math without invalidating the generality of the conclusions.
: [[User:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog]] ([[User talk:Prokaryotic Caspase Homolog|talk]]) 08:59, 8 November 2018 (UTC)

: Spacetime diagrams usually compare two frames in standard configuration. So the origin represents <math>t = t' = 0</math> where all the spatial coordinates line up. The preparatory work is to (1) enable a bare minimum introduction to spacetime diagrams, since they are currently used in the article with no explanation; (2) allow derivation of the invariant interval from the LTs for the simple case of frames in standard configuration.

::I was primarily triggered by the diff-display and expected some immediate treatment of spacetime diagrams (x/ct), and so I think I misunderstood not only the term "standard configuration", in wrongly binding it to a frame with ''orthogonal'' temporal and spatial axes, but also the term "origin", as the event with full blown coordinates (0,0,0,0), and no worldline of (0,0,0). Looking at the whole section, I understand your hint to "already", nevertheless, I still think that S and S' are depicted as spatial coordinates, whereas the section deals with spacetime coordinates.

::: The treatment of Minkowski spacetime diagrams in progress begins with the spatial diagram as a starting point. It probably won't be ready to upload until the weekend.
