== Susceptibility to magnetic fields ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#cite_ref-135 This section] is bad.  The cited reference includes some talk on the subject, but lacks any expert statements.  At best it includes a few people who ''claim'' hard drives were damaged by magnets, but I doubt many of the individuals are experts.  The magnetic fields required for writing to a modern hard drive are ''very'' intense.  My understanding is you could put a rare earth magnet directly onto a modern disk platter and the magnetic field of the magnet would ''fail'' to damage any data (instead dust and tiny scratches from the contact might well damage the platter).

:: Those are decent, but this these mean that portion of the article needs fixing.  Ideally I'd link to sections 4 and the epilogues of the first link (Peter Gutmann paper), which effectively say modern disks (>1GB) are essentially immune to external magnetic fields.  The kjmagnetics reads like an amateur experiment (not necessarily bad, but be careful of conclusions!) and says the same thing, their report of mechanical scrapping could well have been due to distorting the case of the drive rather than anything having to do with properties of the magnetic field.  "Very old hard drives (less than a gigabyte) may have been at some risk from external magnetic fields, but any drive larger than a gigabyte is essentially immune to external magnetic fields"?

:::: Indeed, 'tis not.  The reference was stating post-1990 hard drives were pretty well immune.  Bit more recollection, I think 100MB drives were coming out around then, so that may be a better rough guide.  The real issue is larger drives have to be less susceptible otherwise the write process would corrupt nearby bits (therefore storage size is a better guide than manufacture date).

The most intuitive dysfunction refers to the moving parts in an HDD. Some people are unclear on that through influence only. As a matter of fact, it IS known that there are no moving parts in an SDD, like the disk found in the HDD, which IS slower than an SSD.

== This article confuses the M.2 form factor (family of form factors) with the NVMe protocol ==

There are statements regarding, e.g., the speed of [[M.2]] drives, which are only true when the M.2 drive uses the [[NVMe]] protocol, while overlooking the fact that other M.2 drives use the [[SATA]] protocol.  (I believe the term "protocol" is more appropriate than "interface" here, and [[Form_factor_(design) | form factor]] is something else again.)

I'm having a first pass at correcting the issue, but someone else who's more informed on the subject should improve the article further.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:W.F.Galway|W.F.Galway]] ([[User talk:W.F.Galway#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/W.F.Galway|contribs]]) 15:51, 22 September 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== "For example, some x86 architectures have a 4 GB limit" ==

I thought ALL x86 architectures had a 4GB limit because that's the limit of combinations of a 32bit memory address, wasn't that one of the prime reasons for switching to 64bit standard.--[[User:KX36|KX36]] 14:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

:I think not, modern x86 CPUs support PAE (although 32-bit Windows generally doesn't, except for some rare drivers) so they can address more than 4 GB at the cost of lower performance.

However, you CAN'T extend the 4 GB limit with a swap file. Allocated pages on swap file are no different than allocated pages in RAM, their address must still be within the 4 GB total. Once you have 4 GB of RAM you don't even need a swap file, it will not be used.

Agreed. Operating systems don't just re-address memory pell-mell when they swap it to disk. Here's a good article on the 4GB limit and memory addressing in general:

== "First company" ==

The section on history was both inaccurate and remains full of holes.

The first company to launch a flash-based solid state drives did certainly not do so as late as 1995, since Psion PLC was already selling its "SSD" units from 1989 onwards. See for example http://3lib.ukonline.co.uk/historyofpsion.htm 

I have no idea who was the first company to do so, but Psion sold "solid state" drives from 1984. The earlier ones were UV-EPROMs or battery-backed static RAM, with flash models introduced later. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:CecilWard|CecilWard]] ([[User talk:CecilWard|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/CecilWard|contribs]]) 21:19, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->

== Read/Write Cycles ==

I'm not sure if this is marketing talk or not, but since there's no source cited in the disadvantages section I think this is apt:

"Q: Is there currently some sort of technical limitation on the creation of SSDs other than cost, and what about the reliability of flash media? 

A: Historically SSDs were limited in the number of R/W cycles. However, with modern flash technology and error correction, the reliability of the flash in a PC exceeds 10 years. " [http://www.tfot.info/content/view/100/59/]

The [[Compact_Flash]] article states a read/write cycle up to 300,000. 

The [[Read-only_memory#EPROM.2FEEPROM.2FEAROM_lifetime]] article states up to 100,000.

== Read/Write Cycles ==

The claim that was on this page that endurance is not a problem, with the reference to storagesearch, is incorrect. It is true that if the hard disk were overwritten as a whole, over and over and over again, it would last a very long time. The problem is that's not a common access pattern. Under GNU/Linux, if you're running a web server, /var/log/apache/access.log will get written with each access. If you're getting an access once every second, that means you're overwriting the same spot on the hard disk 86,400 times per day, and your SSD fails after 2-3 days tops (real-world Flash gets 100,000 write cycles typically, and 300,000 on the high-end. 1-5 million are slightly exaggerated marketing figures, and at least the high-end of that is not actually achieved with today's technology). With a desktop GNU/Linux box, there are log files that get written many times per day. Access times get marked on common files every couple of minutes at most. Similar issues exist with Windows. Flash drives used naively will fail after at most a few months use on the desktop. Many embedded network devices come with Flash for log files, but the Flash is a replaceable part, and typically wears out after some use and needs to be replaced. 

I've seen both the desktop and the embedded failures occur (on the desktop, with a naive user, using a CF-IDE converter, and in the embedded case, replacing Flash was just standard maintenance). I haven't seen the server case occur, because all the sysadmins I know using SSDs are intelligent enough to manage the endurance issues. 

The failures can be mitigated through the use of intelligent software. OLPC spurred the rapid development of Flash-optimized files systems for GNU/Linux. These intentionally stagger writes over the whole drive, so that no single block gets worn down. Hybrid Flash/non-Flash drives use the Flash as a cache, and again, can intelligently manage the part of the Flash that gets used with each write. All-Flash drives have their place, and can be managed to not fail, but the endurance issue does occur, and does need to be managed. Many SSDs have firmware to manage this, but many of the SSDs I have dealt with do not. It is an issue the user needs to be aware of. I have corrected the page to reflect that.

We're arguing over symantics. On the "RAM disk" page that's marked for possible merging, the article itself states that it can be one of two things. So we're talking about two different things here. I suggest that a disambiguation page is created. It will point to either this SSD page, which could be merged with half the RAM disk article; or the RAM disk's "software abstraction that treats a segment of random access memory (RAM) as secondary storage". I used the latter extensively and can attest to it being a different beast entirely. And yes, SSD's that use volatile memory as a hardware component are indeed the same thing, just volatile.[[User:Falkreon|◗●◖ falkreon]] ([[User talk:Falkreon|talk]]) 05:49, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

:They are still separate.  I think SSD is probably the more appropriate article for the usage you mention, since it is an implementation of a DRAM based SSD using off the shelf hardware/software.

:To establish something like when something originated would need a reliable source [[WP:RS]] that established a basis for the claim (e.g. patents, literature search, etc.).  The site mentioned is not reliable for establishing this.  It is easy to disprove the assertion of the idea originating in July/Aug '08.  For instance, this thread [http://www.silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=45727&highlight=] has a posting of the idea from January of '08, and some of the posts in it refer to earlier implementations of the idea.    Since as the cited website mentions this is a pretty trivial "invention," and the necessary components have been around for a few decades, it would probably be difficult to trace back and prove a first use/inception.  Any claim to originating a very simple idea like this would be extraordinary, and therefore require extraordinary proof.  20:09, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

== Read/Write Cycles (another one) ==

When calculating the endurance level of the hardware, the article claims "blocks are typically on the order of 1kb and an 8 GB disk will have 8,192 blocks", which unless I'm very much mistaken is out by a factor of 2^10, i.e. 8,192 * 1Kb = 8Mb, not 8Gb.

== Read/Write Cycles (yet another one) ==

As the previous comment indicated, the description of wear leveling in the text is not only very naive but also very wrong. 

The nature of NAND flash is such that one typically must erase whole 128KB blocks, and then consecutively write 64 2KB pages within that block. There are no rewrites, so in order to rewrite a single 2KB page, the entire 128KB block must be erased. So, with a naive implementation the endurance of a single block drops 64 times (to about 160 rewrites?). 

The main problem is not wear leveling itself, but how to avoid the need to rewrite existing data, that is how to avoid fragmentation. This problem is not 100% solvable in general unless once can predict the future. One hardware solution is to cache some data in a battery-backed RAM to avoid immediately rewriting it.

[[User:24.4.151.152|24.4.151.152]] 17:24, 29 September 2007 (UTC)

The problem can be solved by more innovative filesystem designs, such as [[Log-structured file system]]s.  Segmentation is a non-problem for such file systems.  You can always predict with 100% certainty ''where'' you're going to write next, although you still can't predict ''when'' you're doing so.

== Solid State and Tubes ==

Please take out the line in the intro refering to vacuum tubes.  The term "Solid State" has always refered to semiconductors and only semiconductors, not tubes.  It has to do with the fact that dopants are difused into the silicon while in a solid state in a way that mimics diffusion in liquid.

== Disadvantage? - "Vulnerability to certain types of effects,...magnetic fields..." ==

Working with some of the largest magnetic fields found in the industrial world, SSDs are the only allowed hard-drive replacement in a production environment. Mechanical hard drives die pretty much instantly or are rendered un-usable/erased.

Maximum gauss is ~ 2,000. With an average of 40-80 Gauss in normal walkway area's. Some equipment is under ~ 80-400 Gauss, all flash based storage. Magnetic field source is a DC current at ~200-350kA.

Main issues are with DC-DC converters under such conditions, so the potential for power supply in the SSD to fail rather than the flash itself.

Hard-Disks will NOT survive this environment. Flash based SSDs are the only storage device able to withstand these conditions.

Should this "disadvantage" be moved to an "advantage"?

[[User:Badbiki|Badbiki]] ([[User talk:Badbiki|talk]])

The mentioned disadvantage is ridiculous. "Compared to normal HDDs (which store the data inside a Faraday cage).". Is there anything preventing SSD's from being put in the same cage?

== Overall quality ==

Hi!

I apologize for the critical view of my post and I respect the people who contributed to this article.
However I feel that it does not meet the minimal criteria for a respected Wikipedia article.

First of all the article seems fragmented. When we say SSD we mean permanent solid storage, not battery-aided DRAM.
It's just like saying DRAM is non-volatile just because you own a UPS. 
Flash sticks or other solid state media (SD, CF, MS) even they are technically solid-state storage, they are not solid-state-DRIVES -- they're memory cards.
So, first of all, FOCUS on the subject.

Secondly article lacks of scientific information or any data a technically curious or a computer science student or researcher may find of any value.

Thirdly I believe *links* (not actual figures, we're not a HW review site, unless numbers are solid and confirmed) to benchmarks should be included, many potential SSD byers may advise this page.

Forth: Sections are fragmented, article lacks of an overall coherence. It seems that it was written by an uncoordinated team, by separate people with their ideas popping here and then. Sorry to say that but article is messy.

Regrettably I believe that it should be marked for quality review in order to meed minimal quality standards.

Thank you and I apologize for criticizing other's hard work.

:There are so many little articles about similar devices that it makes sense to combine a few of them.  Since flash drive is a subset of SSD, and the article overlaps a lot with this one, it makes sense to merge them.

== Disadvantage: Limited write (erase) cycles ==

I think this paragraph could use a rewrite. With proper write leveling techniques, the practical threat to your data is negligible. Before this starts to be a real risk-factor, you're likely to have had a disk failure for a completely unrelated reason or upgraded to a newer completely different system or whatever. Not saying we should sweep this source of errors under the carpet, but the paragraph could be rewritten to give off a more moderated impression of the risk level involved. [[User:CapnZapp|CapnZapp]] ([[User talk:CapnZapp|talk]]) 19:12, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

some info is not correct

{{ As a result of wear leveling and write combining, the performance of SSDs degrades with use . Eventually, wear leveling will use each page on the drive at least once, so further writes always involve a block erase. Although write combining (if supported by the device) offers advantages, it causes internal fragmentation in the SSD which degrades the sequential read speed. Such fragmentation cannot be mitigated by the operating system. }}

1. so further writes always involve a block erase, 
that does not allways happen (block is 4KB each page is 512KB each) when all blocks have been writen to is does an page wipe ([http://www.anandtech.com/storage/showdoc.aspx?i=3531&p=5 block and pages look at page 5,6 and 7])

2. it causes internal fragmentation in the SSD which degrades the sequential read speed, SSDs Prefer fragmented files as then it can hit as many cells as it can when reading files as it can make them go read faster (2-10 depending on what type of ssd is it, intel is 10, Indilinx 4 (i think) Jmicron is 2-4 )

once all SSD pages have been writen to thay slow down as thay need to do an Page Erace before it can save but it will not allways erace every time something is saved as there is likey going to be spare blocks around from an erace that happened before

== progress on newer drives ==

I think it's about time to remove "capacity" from the disadvanteges of the SSD drives soon. Next month there will be 2TB SSDs available meeting the 2TB capacity of HDDs. Yes, the new drives will be ridiculously expensive ($10k?) but that is already covered by the cost disadvantage.

Also regarding volumetric density, The HDDs with best GB/cm2 drive are e.g Western Digital 2.5" drives at 1TB. Their physical size is about 80 cubic centimeters whereas http://www.tomshardware.com/news/puresilicon-ssd-1tb,6810.html#xtor=RSS-181 drives are about 65 cubic centimeters at the same capacity.
[[User:Darin-0|Darin-0]] ([[User talk:Darin-0|talk]]) 10:51, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

(Feb 16, 2010) The info about SSD prices in the article looks:<br />
1) Outdated. $2 per GB? I don't know about small capacity (40-120GB) drives, but 250GB ones cost $3-4 per GB and 1TB ones are at $10/GB.<br />
2) Misleading. Because for traditional 3,5" HDDs (non-SCSI) price per GB of storage is LOWER for higher capacity models. As of now 250GB HDDs cost $.25/GB and 1TB ones cost $.1/GB.<br />
This makes SSDs much less competitive then they might seem from reading the article. Since 500GB+ HDDs are now mainstream, similar capacity SSDs would have to become 50-100 (!) times cheaper to fall into the same price range.
== Rewrite of Quality and performance section ==

I am currently going through this article cleaning up as much as I can. I do have some experience in the storage industry, so I find it relatively easy to search for sources to this article because I am familiar with the technology. I have recently spent 3-4 hours searching for real sources on the StorageTek statement, but could only find one credible source that was not simply copying the current Wikipedia SSD article. That document was written by Fred Moore, the one time Corp VP of Strategic Planning at Storage Technology Corporation (StorageTek). [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930003944_1993003944.pdf] On page 1-9 there is mention of 1979 being the year that Storage Technology Corp introduced the fist SSD according to Fred.

Since MLCs' and SLCs' applications go beyond that of use in SSDs alone (the example of Intel's 8087 processor given in the MLC article, for instance), and SLCs are significantly different from MLCs, it would seem appropriate to separate the SLC (Single-level cell) and MLC pages, and to link them each to the SSD one - and vice-versa.

There is no mention of the security (or not) of data on an SSD.
Traditionally sectors on a conventional HDD are not cleared upon deletion (or fomat) but only by explicit over-write.
I beleive that most SSDs are transitioning to FDE (Full Disk Encryption) with a random initial key or user generated password if specified which deals with much of this concern.
How about some of this going into the article (BTW: I am looking for a laptop SDD or new HDD that MUST be FDE and therefore my data will be secure!) [[Special:Contributions/122.148.41.172|122.148.41.172]] ([[User talk:122.148.41.172|talk]]) 07:18, 31 October 2010 (UTC)
:It turns out some SSDs are headed to self-encryption, but many are not.

In either case we should add something on the security benefits of encryption. We just need a public source we can reference (otherwise I would write it up myself, but that would be primary research and not allowed here.

Some of the consumer level stuff out there is cheap chinese junk that is decidedly insecure even though the manufacturer advertises otherwise.

== Link to article on SSD operation and issues ==

Hello. This is my first Wikipedia post, and not fully sure how to make it useful. 

I came to this article directly by searching for SSD. But the article barely touches on the technicals SSD operation. That information is covered extensively in the article linked as "Write Amplification", a well-written overview of the technical operation and issues of SSDs. This article is the one I needed to find in order to make an informed choice about SSD types and their issues and limitations. However it was largely by luck that I found it.

My suggestion is that the Write Amplification link be given higher prominence in the SSD article (in See Also?), and perhaps that article could be renamed to indicate that it serves as a comprehensive technical overview. I am sorry I am not a competent enough editor to tackle this myself, just an appreciative reader.

== RAM-based SSD's become obsolete ==

Let's consider.
1. Read speed of both RAM and "RAIDed" flash drives might be as fast as the interface allows (at least two vendors are now ready to supply SATA 3 flash SSD with 500-600 MB/sec read speed.
2. Write speed is a bit more difficult to manage, but Micron already samples flash SSD with 250 MB/sec write speed, May also rise the write speed to 400-500 MB/sec with some price tag added (interleaving needs a bit more complex approach.
3. In principle, it is now possible to produce direct PCIe (even direct to memory channel - see Intel Turbo Memory) attached flash subsystems with multiple levels of interleaving and stripping working on PCIe 3 speed with the price no greater than $20 per GB.

The "wear-out" issue is also becoming less significant - mothern drives may work up to 3-5 years as Vista OS drives.

Compare this price with prices on cheapest RAM-based solutions and you'll see that (might be exept for very rare ultra-write-intensive SQL applications) flash SSDs are now much more price/performance attractive than RAM-based (with the same functionality).[[User:Stasdm|Stasdm]] ([[User talk:Stasdm|talk]]) 07:04, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

== This isn't my field, but ==

...this story on Engadget today (http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/01/ocz-reveals-core-series-sata-ii-2-5-ssds-128gb-for-479/) looks pretty significant: "these drives check in at $169 (32GB), $259 (64GB) and $479 (128GB), which -- as you undoubtedly recognize -- are amazing price points. Each unit utilizes NAND flash technology, possesses a 1.5-million hour mean time before failure and delivers 120 - 143Mbps read / 80 - 93Mbps write speeds. The sub-0.35ms seek times are also worthy of a tip of the hat, and the low power consumption just makes things unnecessarily sweeter." - Dan [[User:Dank55|Dank55]] ([[User talk:Dank55|talk]])([[Special:Contributions/Dank55|mistakes]]) 20:29, 1 July 2008 (UTC)


Answer: Unfortunately, all this data is not quite right and needs to be looked at with a lot of care. The mtbf does not have any meaning at all, it could as well last 10 minutes. Also consider that those drives use MLC and not SLC chips. The random write is much worse than the stated 80 Mbps (which means Mbit per second and is wrong in this case. It should be MB/s = Megabyte per second).

== Subject matter/WP:V, WP:OR, WP:RS experts needed re. ATA/ATAPI support for SSD ==

Greetings. I am currently having great difficulty with editor [[user:Ramu50|Ramu50]] re the [[Advanced Technology Attachment]] article, specifically over whether solid state drives are "really" supported by ATA. 

:They are by SATA by not by PATA, if the user want to prove otherwise fine[[User:Andrewcrawford|Andrewcrawford]] ([[User talk:Andrewcrawford|talk]]) 20:25, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

:: No, the PATA spec includes specific provisions for SSD. Anyway this is long since settled. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 18:05, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

I claim they are; the ATA docs say so, explicitly and also by inclusion ("any form of storage device may be placed on the interface"). Ramu50 claims that citing the ATA docs is "original research". Accordingly Ramu50 has repeatedly removed the mention of SSDs from the article lede. 

I have opened a case at [[WP:RSN]]. The specific section at WP:RSN is 
[[WP:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Advanced_Technology_Attachment_article.2C_is_citing_the_ATA_spec_re._solid_state_drives_considered_OR.3F|here]].  I've included a large number of diffs there. 

This dispute is also discussed, if that is the word, in a long thread (actually several) at the AT Attachment article's talk page: [[talk:Advanced Technology Attachment]]. 

The input of any SSD or ATA subject matter experts and/or Verifiability, Original Research, or Reliable Sources experts would be appreciated. Thank you. --[[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 09:26, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

== "faraday cage" ==

I'm going to let someone else check me on this, but I'm almost 100% sure this statement is completely irrelevant. A faraday cage is basically anything conductive surrounding the drive--there is no reason why SSDs do not have a faraday cage, and I'm almost certain all reasonable manufacturers already use a metal case for their SSDs (they're expensive enough already, why would they skimp with plastic?) Anyway, one problem DRAM-based versions might be susceptible to are soft errors (read on wikipedia). Generally, I'd imagine this is pretty easily mitigated with some error correction (which probably is implemented, anyway. . .)

== "SLC vs MLC" ==

Lower priced drives usually use multi-level cell (MLC) flash memory, which is slower and less reliable than single-level cell (SLC) flash memory.[13][14]

Andrew-

Sorry for taking so long to respond, but Hurricane Ike came through and provided some distraction here in Houston (we were closed for a week), then we had our first Solid State Storage Initiative (SSSI) elections and productive meetings out at IBM in San Jose. Fun. Now I'm back in the saddle. I don't want to cause you more work; I want to help SSSI contribute to your already impressive SSD content. I've discovered that others in the Storage Networking Industry Assoc. (SNIA) have contributed to Wikipedia previously. Let me find out from them if we have an experienced Wikipedia writer, and if so, maybe we can supply all our own contributions with minimal help from you. Neal

== Write cycles and wear leveling ==

Please stop removing cited material.  If you think the information is incorrect, please provide citations for other views on the matter.  

The Infoworld article {{cite web|title=Solid-state disk lackluster for laptops, PCs| url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Storage&articleId=9112065&taxonomyId=19&pageNumber=1| accessdate=2008-09-12| author=Lucas Mearian| date=August 27, 2008}} says:

:"Corporate-grade SSD uses single-level cell (SLC) NAND memory and multiple channels to increase data throughput and wear-leveling software to ensure data is distributed evenly in the drive rather than wearing out one group of cells over another. And, while some consumer-grade SSD is just now beginning to incorporate the latter features."

:"It matters whether the SSD drive uses SLC or MLC memory. SLC generally endures up to 100,000 write cycles or writes per cell, while MLC can endure anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 writes before it begins to fail," [according to Fujitsu's vice president of business development Joel Hagberg.]

Most of the articles on flash media that I have seen here provide no citations to back up statements about wear leveling being used or not used in various devices.  
The main citation used in several articles for the number of write cycles seems to be a web page documenting a Linux file system, which gives a number with no basis whatever (and it isn't clear to what extent the source is a WP:RS for that information).  The infoworld article cited  may be mistaken in these matters, but at least it is a citation in an at least moderately reliable source.  

If there are other views on the matter - fine, provide some reliable sources and lets fix it up.  (i.e., I make no claims for the correctness of the information in the infoworld article, but by Wikipedia standards, it is better than what was there in that it is verifiable)  [[User:Zodon|Zodon]] ([[User talk:Zodon|talk]]) 01:18, 21 September 2008 (UTC)

: My edit comments was obviously too brief, so I will have to try to be even more explicit: First, as you seem to imply yourself, the "cited" article may not be very reliable, as it uses a quite sloppy and tendensious tone, even in its own quotations. Furthermore, a more complete version of ''your'' quotation above would be:

:"''Consumer-grade SSD generally uses multilevel cell (MLC) NAND flash memory, which has greater capacity and a lower-price point but suffers from slower I/O and as much as 10 times fewer read/writes over its life span. Corporate-grade SSD uses single-level cell (SLC) NAND memory and multiple channels to increase data throughput and wear-leveling software to ensure data is distributed evenly in the drive rather than wearing out one group of cells over another. And, while some consumer-grade SSD is just now beginning to incorporate the latter features to increase its performance, there will still be a cost/capacity disparity for years to come.''"

:Here, "''the latter features''" probably aims at "''SLC''" and "''multiple channels''", not at "''wear-leveling''" (as it reads "''performance''"). The fact that ''wear-leveling'' is mentioned last is likely due to careless writing/aiming, ignorance, or the tendensious style that characterizes much of the article. Most importantly, it is certainly not anything from which you could deduce a categorical statement like  "wear levelling is not common in consumer level devices"... For that, you would need either an '''''explicit''''' citation from a reliable source or concrete '''''examples''''' of "consumer level devices" without wear levelling.

:A longer version of your second quotation reads: "''For one thing, it matters whether the SSD drive uses SLC or MLC memory. SLC generally endures up to 100,000 write cycles or writes per cell, while MLC can endure anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 writes before it begins to fail, according to Fujitsu's Hagberg. For its part, Western Digital's laptop hard-disk drive boasts up to 600,000 write cycles.''" What about the tone and style here?

:Another citation clearly illustrates how the writer guesses: "''With software enhancements, MLC can exceed SLC performance, but at its core, it's still MLC memory, which means its life span is greatly reduced because cells'' '''''store more data more often'''''. ''In fact, generally speaking, the higher performance in an SSD drive, the longer life it will have because of'' '''''better drive efficiency'''''.". Anyone with a basic understanding of fundamental "flash memory technology" would see that this is quite confused guesswork.

:Here are some other articles and papers about wear levelling at various technical levels; I could not find a single one suggesting that "wear levelling is not common in consumer level devices":

::My comment about the matter of reliability of the source was purely courtesy.  The edit summaries trying to remove the source claimed that the information was incorrect (without giving any citations or basis for that claim).  It was and is not obvious that the source is biased or incorrect, I was just trying to invite discussion.

::Article interpretation: 
::#Since wear leveling is the last feature mentioned, it is reasonable to assume it is one of the "later features," however many other features were intended.  I don't see trying to re-interpret it to fit some other idea of what it should say.

::It is not clear what point you are trying to make about the tone and style of the quotation relating to number of write cycles.  It seems a straight forward presentation of information.

::: If you really was "trying to invite discussion", then please try consider my arguments.
:::#It's not about "some other idea", it's about correctness. Your interpretation would seem reasonable giving the short '''out of context''' excerption you prefer to look at, however, a slightly longer version makes that interpretation very dubious (see above).
:::#You cannot possible use a '''single''' source for your categorical conclusion about "consumer level devices" unless the quality of the source is at the level of a neutral and reliable academic paper. Otherwise, you would need either more than one source or concrete '''examples''' to support that kind of bold statement (third time I say this...)
:::#Given the fact that wear leveling has been used in various cheap devices (CF, SD, USB-sticks etc) for many years (see references in the wear leveling article, for instance), it would be a little naive to belive that SSDs did not.
:::#"I didn't make use of the final section quoted, so I don't see what the point is." Really? If you are that uninterested in technical basics, perhaps you should delegate some decisions on precise formulations to other people (with the knowledge needed to judge whether things makes sense or not).

::::I responded to your arguments where they related to the article, agreeing that the wording of the wear leveling part could be improved, and asking for clarification about what you found questionable in the section on number of writes.  Beyond that, I requested clarification of what is the point of critiquing the source's style, or the clarity of other sections of the article which weren't used in the Wikipedia article.
::::The wear leveling article was quite thin on references of the sort you mention when I looked a few days ago, as was the USB flash drive article.  I looked at various other articles on flash devices, they tended to mention what wear leveling is, but were short on actual citations backing up claims that they were used in this or that type of device, or measurements of quality/etc.
::::Why make such a big deal about trying to discredit this one reference?  It is a news item, so one does not expect the same level of care/writing/understanding as an article in Nature.

I still think that that is a more constructive approach.

::::::I'm trying very hard to discuss article improvements, with very little success unfortunately. Once again, my main point is that you cannot rely on a '''single''' arbitrary source for your categorical conclusion about "consumer level devices" unless the quality of the source is at the level of an academic paper.

::::::Yes, verifiability is important, but verifiability does not mean you can take '''any''' source, regadless of quality, and (more or less) loosely "interpret" what it says.

::::::'''Update''': Answers to your questions:
::::::*"If wear leveling is commonly used in consumer grade SSDs - fine, what reference says so?" As I said above, there is no reason to suspect "consumer grade" SSDs should be exceptions from other flash based devices, such as cheap CF, SD, and USB devices, which have employed wear leveling for several years (see external links in the wear leveling article for instance). The reason it's not written out explicitly may be the same as why computer manufacturers seldom explicitly state that this model has heat sink and fan in order to prevent the CPU from self destruct (if you see my point).
::::::*It varies, but not to the extent that the limited number of block erases easily shines trough, not even in fairly extreme cases. The most pessimistic life expectancy calculations I've seen is 5 years (a hypothetical scenario of ''continous'' writing at max bandwith 24/7 for five years); more "typical usage" life expectancies can be anywhere between 23 years and thousands of years (see my links above, for instance, or the wiki linked in the SSD article).
::::::*I think most manufacturers specify 10,000 block erase cycles for multi-level NAND-flash, at least that's the figure in datasheets and papers I have come across. Speculating a little, I suspect most SSDs (as opposed to ''low cost'' CF/SD/USB devices) will use single level in the future, as the saving is only a factor of two, and multi-level inherently a little slower.

I think the article should state the wear leveling algorithms typically differ from drive to drive (often the algorithm is engineered for the specific drive depending on life expectancy, density, and can affect drive performance during heavy wear leveling implementation) Sorry no link to source :( [[User:Psignosys|Psignosys]] ([[User talk:Psignosys|talk]]) 13:41, 6 January 2009 (UTC)Psignosys

To clarify this, there needs to be studies that test:
1. Wear leveling with sequential writes on an empty drive
2. Wear leveling with sequential writes on an 99% full drive (with all other sectors unmodified)
3. Wear leveling with 4kB random writes on an empty drive
4. Wear leveling with 4kB random writes on an 99% full drive (with all other sectors unmodified)

My hypothesis is that every drive will handle this differently, but that 2 is worse than 1 and 4 is worse than 3. Whether 3 and 4 are worse than 1 and 2 depends on the quality of the implementation. [[User:Jimhsu77479|Jimhsu77479]] ([[User talk:Jimhsu77479|talk]]) 16:55, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

== 'Problems with SSDs on Windows' ==

The linked article for this section doesn't cover the statements, especially:

"Many Windows users who purchase the MLC disks are baffled as to why the performance of their flash drive is slow."
"The final problem is that the NTFS file system isn't well suited for these flash disks."
"but the fact remains that MLC and SLC disks both perform exceedingly well in Linux using a journaled filesystem like ext3, attaining write speeds far above manufacturer benchmarks, as high as 126MB/s with sequential writes"

I'm tempted to scrub this section altogether unless someone can provide a source or re-write so that the section more accurately represents what the source says. [[User:Macthorpe|Macthorpe]] ([[User talk:Macthorpe|talk]]) 06:46, 22 September 2008 (UTC)

Although it could use some polishing of the language, and some of the details need citation or deleting, the basics don't seem to be too unlikely to be true, just needs a bit more citation.

Also note that the default (and very widely used) allocation cluster size on NTFS is 4 KB. Really, I'm very familiar with the Windows I/O system, file systems, etc., and I just don't see where it is "optimized" for a 512 byte sector size. btw the notion of "running with virtual memory turned off" is pretty laughable. Re. removable drives, sorry, I was thinking of add-on drives, not drives mounted as internal. So things like indexing would still be happening, but I see no reason to think these should burden a SSD proportionally more than they burden a hard drive.

"Tests by an SSD maker show that Windows 2000 is markedly faster than Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS X or Linux, when it is run from an SSD using NAND flash memory.[41] Windows 98 is even faster, but does not support wear leveling, so would cause the drive to wear out quickly.[41]" - This is absolute BS!! Wear leveling is done by the SSD controller. NOT BY THE OS... I read the source and was AMAZED to see it. Unless I am misinterpreting the statement, I strongly believe this is incorrect and should be corrected immediately. The OS (especically today) makes memory accesses at the LBA level. It is up to the drive controller to deteremine which NAND cells to use for that specific LBA. Once a NAND cell becomes worn, it will move that LBA to different physical location on the NAND. The OS will NOT BE INFORMED of this action (nor do they have influence on the matter).

:The terminology is supported by the uses of flash memory described in the article [[Flash memory#Flash memory as a replacement for hard drives]].

== SLC versus MLC ==

This section is either missing information, or contains an irrelevant example.  The paragraph opens with a statement that MLC is slower than SLC, then notes MLC slowness can be mitigated by a variety of mechanisms.  This is all good.  The problem:  The "For Instance" followup explains how a (faster) SLC drive beat (4) (slower) MLC drives in RAID(0) configuration.  If SLC is faster than MLC, an example is not needed of how an SLC drive will beat MLC drives.  Some critical content is missing for the example to be meaningful; without that content, the statement needs to be stricken.

: The whole sentence doesn't make any sense they compare apples to oranges, the SLC "hard drive" is in fact a 4x PCI-Express and the MLC is actually a array of 4 MLC drives. In reality it's a whole different matter some MLC ARE better than some SLC drives, and the other way around. The SLC drives may have the potential to be better but it's not just a question of the memory used but also of the electronics around it, put the SLC with some crappy electronics and it will be even worst than a MLC drive.[[User:Strumf|Strumf]] ([[User talk:Strumf|talk]]) 10:19, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

Check Anandtech[http://www.anandtech.com/show/2829/5]. "Fragmentation" is not the best word to describe; rather, SSDs use a sort of parallel writing scheme in order to boost performance by utilizing the inherent parallelism of multiple channels. The "fragmentation" problem is when one performs many small writes, by repeated cycles of writing-reading-invalidation, the spots that are free to accept data become randomly distributed within any particular flash channel, making write speeds very slow (because the SSD has to do an erase cycle for nearly every write).

So in essence, the statement is correct but should be better worded.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jimhsu77479|Jimhsu77479]] ([[User talk:Jimhsu77479|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jimhsu77479|contribs]]) 19:51, 28 July 2010 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== exFAT and no evidence of benefits to an SSD ==

I believe there have been some debates on this article in the past if exFAT did anything for SSDs or not. I searched the MS site for any evidence and found nothing. Certainly they differentiate between SSDs and USB flash devices with Windows 7, but for exFAT they only talk about USB or flash devices. SSDs are different from generic flash devices. The MS source cited below never uses the term ''SSD'' which is suspicious because they use it a lot on Windows 7. Also the other article cited is the only article that discusses SSDs with exFAT. Since no other prominent sites support this claim it seems very dubious and should be removed until we can find additional support or evidence that it is somehow beneficial for SSDs.

In the article under "SSD optimized file systems" it says "The page file should also be disabled because the constant updates to the file will cause unnecessary additional wear on the SSD that is not offset by enough performance gain."

== Quality and performance section quality ==

The entire section titled "Quality and performance" seems terribly written, especially with regards to mentioning time frames and the organization statements. The section is mostly just a spewing of random statistics on SSDs at different dates without making proper comparisons (to HDDs, or newer/older SSDs) nor including the context of the statistic/statement. SSDs are used for a variety of applications, and posting business networking sources along with residential-use sources without distinguishing them is terrible. Frankly I cannot believe such a piece of text could exist for such a long period of time on such an important/popular article.

I recommend that the section be completely re-written without including any of the currently mentioned statistics or statements, and that new ones be found pertaining to information regarding: performance over time changes for SSDs which are properly maintained (as well as improperly maintained), performance of new SSDs vs new HDDs be it in RAID or otherwise (keeping mention of the application it's being used for), and relevant performance flaws that exist in specific SSDs or generations of SSDs.

Lastly, somewhat as the section says already, a good statement possibly make at the start would be an explanation that SSDs performance are changing/increasing quickly over time and the precision of the section may not be adequate due to age.

The CF uses NAND flash, and also SSD. 
The CF have wear leveling and read-write cycle problems, like SSD
The CF (integrated) controller support ATA/IDE specs, like SSD. (usually is needed a passive CF-IDE adapter for different pinout from IDE) 
The CF (integrated) controller support SATA, like SSD.

== Really significantly biased. ==

Not enough treatment of the problems with SSD technology.
While firm-ware bugs are mentioned, (and IMHO cavalierly dismissed), whether the failure of the drive is firmware or hardware caused is irrelevant to most users.  The technology is poorly covered here.  No discussion of the trade-offs between single layer and multiple layers, nor is there any clear exposition on the virtual certainty that only a finite number of write cycles will be tolerated by each bit.
I rate this article marginal in its objectivity.  Clearly it is NOT acceptable for permanent memory to fail "catastrophically" and yet this issue is very lightly touched upon. And confounding DRAM technology is another seemingly intentional obfuscation.  It is very questionalble that the different technological approaches to SSDs should be lumped together in a table compared to HD technology.[[Special:Contributions/71.31.146.16|71.31.146.16]] ([[User talk:71.31.146.16|talk]]) 20:04, 17 June 2012 (UTC)
== Add a bit on 'reliability' please. ==

Thank you for this article. The question of reliability seems to come up quite often when discussing SSDs. Although you address this somewhat in your article, I've yet to come across the following aspect, which would be useful and reassuring to have for the reader: What happens when the SSD dies? If the drive simply becomes a brick, that would be useful to know. If the drive simply stops accepting write commands, then that too would be useful to know - which is to say, when an SSD dies, can it simply be cloned on to another one and you get on with your day, or is the data simply gone. Granted, it depends upon the nature of the failure, but someone examining this article is usually looking for 'what are these beasties', and thus, typical scenarios. Done but readable matters - an OS can be reloaded (but PITA), but reassembling the particular collection of programs and data, once dead, can be challenging. (Never mind that backups should be made, etc., nor the challenge of live snapshotting drive images.) So, it would be useful if the typical 'death state' of an SSD were mentioned.

I removed this because it's a massive spam magnet and gives the false impression that SSD's are a very recent invention.

: Well, the flash drive (like it's cousins CF,SD etc) is in fact a fairly recent invention. A natural split of this article into a Flash-drive and a RAM-drive article (much like before) would solve this problem as well as others, such as the messy advantages/disadvantages section. RAM-drives and flash-drives does not use the same memory technology, neither do they have the same purpose (basically speed boosts in high perfomance computers versus (semi-) permanent storage in harsh environments such as laptops and embedded systems), the only thing in common would be the IDE/SATA interface, not enough to lump them together as I see it.

::When were flash-based and RAM-based SSD separate articles?  The history is common to both.  The two current implementations of SSD have more in common than just the interface.

Both are touted for performance improvements (at least in high-end versions).  The function could be dealt with similarly to the USB flash drive article - storage devices (link to relevant article with summary) plus controller/interface.

:::: The timeline is not my major concern here (as you probably have grasped), although I find no reason to exclude recent history (when someone has made an effort to include it). The question of age is very much about how far it's ''reasonable'' to stretch a definition; one could argue that the first SSDs were [[core memory]] (solid state although not transistors) or, at the other extreme, that is was the first ''commercial'' product that was ''named'' SSD ''and'' also resembling a hard-disk, or whatever. However, it's hard to escape the fact that various form of "RAM-drives" and "RAM-disks" has been around much longer than any flash-device, as flash technology was developed in the eighties and grew large (in both popularity and capacity) during the nineties.

:::: Furthermore, I don't think we should be so concerned with the ''size'' of articles, that's really secondary, but instead try to concentrate on achieving the most logical and natural structure among (as well as within) articles. In this case, ''Solid State Drive'' would better be a rather small "umbrella" article covering some general history and technology and mentioning that the term SSD has come to denote so quite different products (and why). From there ''RAM-drive'' and ''Flash-drive'' can be linked, which, of course, cover each respective concept/product in detail.

:::::The different characteristics of DRAM memory vs. Flash mean there are different considerations when building one, but volatility is not necessarily an end-user concern.  A DRAM based SSD appears non-volatile to the user.  From a users perspective they aren't fundamentally different - you have an interface, something on the other end remembers the data you write at a location and gives it back to you when you ask for it.  Whether that something is a hard disk, DRAM, flash, bubble memory, etc. means they have different characteristics (power usage, access time, startup time, etc.) but it is functionally the same.

4 - Preventing duplication is one of the concerns.  It makes things harder to to read (i.e. you have to mush through a bunch of re-hash to find what you are looking for, and makes it hard to know that you have read what there is here about a topic) and makes maintenance harder.  There needs to be a good reason to incur the overhead of an extra article.  When something gets large enough that it is cumbersome to handle as one article, that is a reasonable reason to split.  Until then it is better to forgo the overhead of handling an extra article.

5 - As noted various types of SSD have different characteristics, which makes them better suited to different applications.  Volatility is probably not the main reason RAM based SSDs would be less suitable in laptops, etc. (lower storage density, greater power demand and cost seem likely to be more significant limiters).  Volatility can be engineered around now, the other factors are harder.  

6 - If all the articles on drives on Wikipedia were together in one 24 KB article I would work to add content, rather thank advocating splitting it before it had expanded to the point where more articles were needed.

7 - As noted above, and as done in the USB flash drive article.  Details about the memory go in the article on the memory, details about the interface go in the article on the interface (USB, ATA, etc.), details about putting it all together go here.  When there is enough material that it makes sense to split, then might split to a flash drive article (combining those portions of USB flash drive).  However if most of the detail is in the controllers, might create an article on controllers, or maybe something else entirely.

Until it grows we won't know what became the big branch and where it makes sense to make the division.  While we can guess at logical structures, we can't be sure what will evolve until it does.  I don't see making little articles based on one model of how to divide the information, rather wait until it grows up.  [[User:Zodon|Zodon]] ([[User talk:Zodon|talk]]) 08:13, 13 October 2008 (UTC)

(Cont'd from Separating Flash and RAM-based SSD Advantages and Disadvantages above)

I '''agree'''. It would be more clear and less confusing if we could move out RAM-based SSDs out of the article. That kind of SSDs are much much more expensive and thus specialized. I predict almost all mainstream users will have the flash-based kind in mind when they think of SSDs, use them or go to this page for information.

== Advantage ==

Secure Erases are faster on a flash drive. Rotational drives performs secure erases by redundantly erasing itself or writing zeroes to the entire drive to remove any trace of data on the rotational media. This can take a significant amount of time. SSDs do not have this problem. (see data remnance) [[User:Psignosys|Psignosys]] ([[User talk:Psignosys|talk]]) 13:41, 6 January 2009 (UTC) Psignosys

:Reference?  Security and questions of when something is really gone are tricky enough that really need good sources.  (Please clarify "(see data remnance)," was that supposed to be [[Data remanence]], although that article doesn't seem to cover flash memory, or how to securely erase them.)  Seems like secure erasure might be harder because of wear leveling, etc. - harder to access a specific memory cell? [[User:Zodon|Zodon]] ([[User talk:Zodon|talk]]) 02:04, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

::Please pardon my misspelling of [[Data remanence]], I think I was trying to say two things at once. But yes that was what I was referring to. As far as data remanence goes, rotational media is much more susceptible to data recovery via data remanence than NAND based flash drive. Detecting and calculating remanent charge levels on a floating gate is much more difficult. On MLC NAND flash, even if remanent charge levels of floating gates are measured and quantified, knowledge regarding charge level thresholds must be known (specific to a particular NAND). (since each cell can represent 2 bits per cell, that means each cell has 4 charge states. This will make it even more difficult with 3 bit per cell FLASH technology). I hate to use my personal experience as a reference but I'll use it as such and the community can simply void it :p 

::My other statement was simply saying that NAND erase procedure is significantly faster. NAND erases are done by pulling the NAND silion well to a certain voltage, removing charge from the floating gate oxide blocks at a time (at present each block may be typically 256KB to a 1MB). The time this takes is very short. While rotational media still needs to overwrite data one bit at a time. Even if it is done at the block level. (some architectures may support erasing multiple blocks at once, but this contributer has never come accross them). The wear leveling data is typically stored out of bounds of the user accessible data. So the drive can erase all user data while maintaining its internal metadata. SSD drives typically have various tables which distinguishes between user accessible data space and its own metadata. So the controller can refer to this prior to performing a secure erase. reference: personal experience :p

:::As far as the speed thing - sounds like you are saying that need to erase the whole device in order to get secure erasure.  (As compared to being able to erase selected portion of a hard disk.)  Seems like care would still be needed to avoid pathological cases where you didn't erase everything because you erased the same section multiple times (depends on details of wear leveling algorithm).

I read the article and I have a couple of comments.

1. "The typical CF card interface is generally 3-4 times slower than an SSD." It would be nice to say what "CF" means.

2. The FreeBSD section mentions Linux. I wonder if the FreeBSD section should fall under Linux just like Vista falls under Windows.

: Two - No. FreeBSD is not a version, branch, fork, etc., of Linux, nor vice-versa. See the [[FreeBSD]] and [[Linux]] articles for details. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 20:53, 24 October 2012 (UTC)

== Gross inaccuracies regarding filesystem fragmentation ==

This article's treatment of the issue of filesystem fragmentation is terrible.  Please consider the following statements from the article:

'''"SSD technology can deliver rather consistent read/write speed, but when lots of individual smaller blocks are accessed, performance is reduced."'''
This statement is true.

'''"There is limited benefit to reading data sequentially (beyond typical FS block sizes, say 4KB), making fragmentation negligible for SSDs."'''
The article cited for this statement does not discuss filesystem fragmentation at all, making it entirely inappropriate as a source for this statement.  As stated earlier in the article, performance is reduced when lots of individual smaller blocks are accessed.  To make the claim that the effects of filesystem fragmentation are negligible, with no source or data to back it up, is irresponsible and misleading.  The truth is that the effects of filesystem fragmentation vary depending on the situation and absolutely can cause a non-negligible performance impact.  I have personally measured up to a 35% difference in a real-world scenario, which does not seem very negligible to me.

'''"Defragmentation negatively affects the life of the SSD and has no benefit."'''
The first statement here is true, while the second statement is false.  This kind of lie has no place on Wikipedia.

== Is SSD = Solid State Disk a mistake? ==

There's been a minor edit skirmish (not up to war levels) on the "correct" definition of the acronym for SSD – Solid State Drive or Solid State Disk.  I think we agree most sources say Drive, but can we state that saying Disk is "mistaken"?  SSDs have neither disks nor drives; I think both are equally "wrong".  We'd need more than our own opinions to declare one as a mistake; we'd need a source, and I don't think any respected source could claim either is right or wrong; at most one might be "preferred".  So, I've removed any right/wrong indication, and added this per [[WP:BRD]].  --[[User:A D Monroe III|A D Monroe III]] ([[User talk:A D Monroe III|talk]]) 20:20, 18 August 2014 (UTC)

:Anon's addition is grammatically incorrect and redundant, since the same parenthetical text already points out that they contain no actual disk. The introductory sentence should keep things simple. Save the nitpicking for later once the basics have been established. --[[User:Imroy|Imroy]] ([[User talk:Imroy|talk]]) 20:38, 18 August 2014 (UTC)

Could you please explain why SSDs are not drives?! Its the same as in HDD = hard disk drive. You wouldn't say hard disk disk, would you?  Look at: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drive#Noun  "(computing) A mass storage device in which the mechanism for reading and writing data is integrated with the mechanism for storing data, as a hard drive, a flash drive.". So as you can see Drive is correct. And Disk is wrong, obviously.

:First, Anon IP, just to answer your question, HDDs have a "drive" -- the spindle motor; SSDs do not.  So, yeah, SSDs aren't "disks", but they also aren't "drives", technically.

:But that really doesn't matter.  Some people call SSDs "disks"; that's just a fact.  Maybe they "shouldn't", but stating that here won't change that.  Even if it ''could'' change people's minds, we Wikipedia editors aren't allowed to even attempt to do that.  Wikipedia ''collects'', not ''corrects'' information.  See Wikipedia's core sourcing policy [[WP:Verifiability, not truth]].  If you can find a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] that states "disk" is "wrong", ''then'' we can state that; in fact, ''must'' state that.  Without such a source, we ''must'' just inform readers of the existing situation, however much we might like to wish it were otherwise.  --[[User:A D Monroe III|A D Monroe III]] ([[User talk:A D Monroe III|talk]]) 15:12, 20 August 2014 (UTC)

:Anon, I did indeed read your source.  It definitely implies that an SSD can be called a drive.  It does ''not'' say it cannot be called anything else.  (And it's a tertiary source; Wikipedia relies on [[WP:secondary source]]s.)

:Wikipedia policy forbids the change you suggest.  Wikipedia editors cannot [[WP:NPOV|pass judgment]] on the correctness of commonly-held information, only report it.  (For example, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was not holy, was not Roman, and was not an empire, but that's what everyone calls it, so we call it that too.)

:There is no source given that actually states "Solid State Disk" is "wrong", so we can't say it is.  

:Note that even though we state SSD is sometimes called "Solid State Disk", as we must, we currently quickly follow this with "though it contains no actual disk".  That's as far as we can go.

== ...and lower power ==

I suggest adding something about SSD being lower power than spinning drives, in the excellent phrase:

Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, have lower access time, and less latency.[7]

Suggested change: add "require less power"

Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, require less power, have lower access time, and less latency.[7]

Also, since there is an SLC vs MLC table, and now TLC is out, TLC should at least be introduced, perhaps with a reference to:

which has been updated to TLC.

:::No, [[solid-state storage]] doesn't redirect to [[eMMC]]. Those are two different articles about two different storage medias.

Actually the word ''media'' doesn't mean software, it stands for a particular form of storage material for computer files, for example magnetic tape or discs. In other words it's a physical media. eMMCs are memory cards and it is also known/used as non-traditional SSDs. You can describe it as a "solid state card" if you like because it is a solid state storage media. Like hard drives SSD technology has improved a lot.

== SSD automatically fragments everything to avoid hot spots? ==

{{user|Pink love 1998}} added this to the SSD/HD comparison table, in the row about fragmentation:

 The critical purpose of the SSD algorithm is to distribute the data to various 
 locations to prevent heat build up on a particular spot, so SSD's are typically 
 always fragmented.

with edit comment:

 Added info, please don't delete I don't know how to insert references and
 advise you to read about SSD's

Inserting references is only barely more complicated than just typing the reference info in prose. Just add <nowiki><ref> (your reference) </ref></nowiki> following your text. If you want to be precise about location, the ref goes before any immediately following space, but after any immediately following punctuation.(like here) Others will improve the formatting by using a cite template. Eventually you'll pick up on that. 

Or, you could add a section to the talk page here, giving your refs. Someone else will pick them up and put them in the article. 

However, even if referenced, this claim raises an issue, and this is the real reason I deleted it. When most people speak of "fragmentation" on a hard drive, we're talking about the fact that large (and sometimes small) files do not occupy contiguous ranges of LBAs. This fragmentation is visible to a file system from the outside of the drive, can be corrected by defragmenters, etc. This has well-known impact on HD performance. It even impacts SSDs, although minimally: to access a part of the file that crosses an extent boundary, two different I/O requests must be issued by the FSD and implemented by the disk driver and other drivers in the stack. 

The... call it ''distribution'' of content from sequential LBAs to different areas of the chips in an SSD is different. It is not visible to e.g. file system drivers, and a defragmentation run would not "fix" it. To the host speaking to the drive through its SATA connector, a file that occupies sequential LBAs still appears to be contiguous even though those LBAs might not be physically contiguous on the chips. 

There is no analog to this in a normal hard drive, other than the occasional "sparing" of bad sectors. 

If this point can be referenced to a [[WP:RS]], it certainly belongs in the article. But I don't think it belongs in the table row that discusses file system fragmentation, certainly not as the first sentence in the entry for SSDs. That table row is just not talking about this sort of thing. Wherever it goes, it needs to be described so as to distinguish it from the non-contiguous-LBA sort of fragmentation. [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 21:04, 13 January 2015 (UTC)

: Yes, isn't heat the reasonable cause for the fragmentation. The SSD keep track of the next memory location using a link pointer. With the argument of latency (very low latency consider it as RAM in RAM the access speed of all locations is the same)  it doesn't matter where the data is stored and because of the higher latency compared to that of HDD, defragmentation is needed because it takes longer to access data from random location(it's funny do you know that ssd uses DDR2 ram technology) .  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Pink love 1998|Pink love 1998]] ([[User talk:Pink love 1998|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pink love 1998|contribs]]) 22:28, 13 January 2015 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

SSDs are obviously only one part of a computer system, but I'd remove the "(see [[Amdahl's law]])" wording anyway. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 12:19, 2 March 2015 (UTC)

== conventional hard drives  ==

Congratulations, now most web pages and government documentation refer to  Conventional Hard Drives   (instead of Magnetic Hard Drives, etc ).
Is it possible to state that Conventional means the majority of the mechanical/magnetic hard drives at the time of writing?

10 years time, conventional may mean a completely new type of Hard Drive.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/164.39.36.212|164.39.36.212]] ([[User talk:164.39.36.212|talk]]) 14:56, 29 October 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Solid-state drive]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&oldid=700339332 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:

== Contentious ==

This page is very contentious. Could it be made to read less as a defense of HDD and more informative. That'd be great.[[Special:Contributions/2602:304:B0D8:6220:C5B4:6BAA:AC2F:43B7|2602:304:B0D8:6220:C5B4:6BAA:AC2F:43B7]] ([[User talk:2602:304:B0D8:6220:C5B4:6BAA:AC2F:43B7|talk]]) 19:59, 28 May 2016 (UTC)

:Contentious?  The article states SSDs are way faster, but way more expensive than HDDs.  Can you give examples of what needs improving?  --[[User:A D Monroe III|A D Monroe III]] ([[User talk:A D Monroe III|talk]]) 21:02, 15 June 2016 (UTC)

: Concur. Please give specific examples of where you think it reads "as a defense of HDD". [[User:Jeh|Jeh]] ([[User talk:Jeh|talk]]) 15:54, 17 June 2016 (UTC)

== Hard drives and altitude ==

[[Solid-state_drive#cite_ref-IHDDF_130-0|This portion]] needs a substantial adjustment.  As the cited source notes, ''many'' hard drives have an altitude limit of 12000 meters above sea level, '''but''' drives designed for high-altitude operation are readily available from manufacturers.  This is also becoming less true, helium-filled hard drives are taking over for large capacity hard drives and if they're impervious to helium, high-altitudes are unlikely to be an issue.  The mention of the breather hole should be merged with this. [[Special:Contributions/207.172.210.101|207.172.210.101]] ([[User talk:207.172.210.101|talk]]) 01:30, 24 June 2016 (UTC)

: As always, we'd need references that helium-filled drives can also work properly on high altitudes. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 13:57, 24 June 2016 (UTC)
