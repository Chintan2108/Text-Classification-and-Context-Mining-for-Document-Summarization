== Removing reference to the Indus Valley ==

There is sharp disagreement about how far the Indus Valley civilisation shared the beliefs of later Hinduism.  And about whether the Vedas endorse a belief in reincarnation.  The writing system of the Indus Valley has not been read and may not even have been a full writing system.  Even though the claim seems to have a source, the source would be going against almost all other sources.  The reference treated a minority view as if it were generally accepted.  --[[User:GwydionM|GwydionM]] ([[User talk:GwydionM|talk]]) 10:12, 15 March 2016 (UTC)

== Removed Rig-veda references, suggestion to add proper ones ==

Quoted Rig-veda verses are not accurate. RV 10:90 is Purusha shukta and it is not about reincarnation, nor the given text is to be found in Purusha shukta translation. Rig Veda 10:16.1-4 is about funeral rites, when soul of the cremated is sent to Pitrloka, the planet of forefathers, where it truly does get a new form, but is not subject to law of karma, it does not create good or bad karma anymore, thus it cannot be considered to be a regular human life, but the kind of an afterlife.

Reincarnation was mentioned in Ṛgveda 3.1.20-21 "The knower of birth is hidden in every birth" (janmañ-janman nihito jātavedāḥ) and Ṛgveda 4.54.2 "For you first impel immortality to the gods worthy of the sacrifice as their highest share; just after that, o Savitṛ, you reveal your gift: lives following in succession for the sons of Manu" (anūcīnā jīvitā mānuṣebhyaḥ).  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Miodrag1963|Miodrag1963]] ([[User talk:Miodrag1963|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Miodrag1963|contribs]]) 00:49, 16 March 2016 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

{{ping|Motivação}} Is "aspect of" superfluous? Per the main article discussion, only an aspect of a living being is believed to reincarnate: soul or consciousness or etc, depending on the tradition. For direct WP:RS support, see [https://www.britannica.com/topic/reincarnation Encyclopedia Britannica], which reads, "Reincarnation, also called transmigration or metempsychosis, in religion and philosophy, rebirth of '''the aspect of''' an individual that persists after bodily death—whether it be consciousness, mind, the soul, or some other entity—in one or more successive existences".

== I have added the connection between Zalmoxianism and Reincarnation and I got a warning that I am vandalizing ==

Zalmoxianism is connected with Pythagoras concepts of reincarnation and transmigration of soul. I was adding the citations and completing my ideas and the concepts got removed and I got a threat that I am vandalizing and that I am subject to punishment if I keep doing this.  

I want my changes reverted because all my concepts presented are based on existing theories . None are personal conjecture. 

This is the person that removed the section of the article I was working on and threatened to remove my privileges. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dr.K.

I want this matter resolved and my article back because I was working on valid knowledge.  

Zalmoxis and Zalmoxianism was an ancient Dacian religion that is connected with Pythagoreanism according to Herodotus. Zalmoxis taught Dacians that people do not die but rather they continue on and in other sources that they return to earth as different people in different places. Zalmoxis himself died and was reborn after 4 years. When Dacians die they celebrate death and laugh because it is an illusion. Trajan prides himself according to sources when he defeated the Dacians because they are the most warlike people they never fear death they celebrate when people die.  I was working on the citations before this person removed my article. Please discuss here and correct this gross  monopolization of knowledge. This should be an openly and freely editable encyclopedia and nobody should have a monopoly on knowledge on what is Reincarnation. If my articles require citations or better sources please let me know but do not remove and threaten me for bringing valid knowledge to the table.

As our friend hasn't provided it, [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_History_of_Herodotus_(Rawlinson)/Book_4 this Wikisource page] is (probably) the only primary source.  Herodotus concludes "I for my part neither put entire faith in this story of Zalmoxis and his underground chamber, nor do I altogether discredit it: but I believe Zalmoxis to have lived long before the time of Pythagoras. Whether there was ever really a man of the name, or whether Zalmoxis is nothing but a native god of the Getae, I now bid him farewell."  It would be inappropriate to describe the claimed resurrection as anything other than myth. What any of this has to do with ''reincarnation'' is beyond me.

Wrong. You can't have reincarnation without having a [[soul]]. I've restored my edits, but have deleted "eternal" - just having "soul". The [[Dalai Lama]] is chosen because he passed the tests of being the reincarnated previous Buddhist leader - google that.

== Paranormal infobox and Numerous Article Problems ==

Right now the article includes the paranormal infobox. The concept of "paranormal" is deeply entwined with pseudosciences, particularly stuff like [[parapsychology]], [[ghost hunting]], and [[cryptozoology]]. Meanwhile, reincarnation is a central component of many religions across the world, both now and in the past.

I've tried to remove this infobox, but the edit was reverted ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reincarnation&oldid=prev&diff=864658776]). The reason? "This article is linked within that paranormal navbox, so it belongs". With that logic, one could expect to said user to argue that because the infobox is on this article, it belongs in the template.

Additionally, the article's lead currently features an image discussing Jianism, and the intro falls in and out of discussing eastern religions rather than summarizing the topic as a whole. The article needs serious work from start to finish. [[User:Bloodofox|&#58;bloodofox:]] ([[User talk:Bloodofox|talk]]) 20:56, 18 October 2018 (UTC)
:I'm not very invested in this article so do whatever (I don't even know why this is on my watchlist), but I do think that when a WikiProject or something decides to create a navbox to link between a series of articles, the place to take up whether or not the article belongs in that series / the navbox belongs on the article is with whoever is behind organizing the series/navbox. Nobody puts together series or navboxes by looking to see what articles already have that navbox, like you suggest might happen; it goes the other way around. --[[User:Pfhorrest|Pfhorrest]] ([[User talk:Pfhorrest|talk]]) 03:48, 19 October 2018 (UTC)

:I agree that there's no compelling reason to include the paranormal infobox and thus concede a common religious concept to "paranormal" while not applying it to concepts like [[heaven]]. Upon reflection, "paranormal" might apply in situations where someone is claiming to have memories of past incarnations, just as it might in situations where someone is claiming to have died and been to heaven briefly, but that doesn't make it an appropriate sidebar for either of those articles. --[[User:Tronvillain|tronvillain]] ([[User talk:Tronvillain|talk]]) 19:20, 19 October 2018 (UTC)

==Comments from 2001==
Reincarnation in early Christianity later squelched by the Church?  Hmmm.  Well.  I'd want a footnote, and it had better not be publised by HarperCollins's religion division.  Basically, Judaism believes in a one-body-per-soul thing (and I know, there is all sorts of interesting controversy about exactly what Judaism in the 1st century thought the afterlife or salvation would be like), and insofar as Christianity grew out of Judaism, that cuts that off.  
--[[User:MichaelTinkler|MichaelTinkler]]

I've read it in two or three different places, I think, so it seemed to deserve mention. I'll try to do a little more research on it.
--[[User:WillWare|WillWare]]
-----
One of the endless lands of controversy in Religion departments is the degree of Greekification that Christianity underwent once pagans started converting.  Reincarnation is an essentially non-Judaic idea, so anyone who says that it was a belief in E. Christianity is asserting that paganism beliefs made substantive changes in ideas about the nature of the Soul.  Not to mention the fact that ancient Mediterranean society was FAR from unanimous on reincarnatin.  The Egyptians sure didn't believe in it (Hence, the Book of the Dead is all about getting to the comfortable afterlife), and the Romans don't seem very interested.  It was, as far as I can tell, not a popular belief but a position taken by some philosophers.  Oh, well - this is what a community project is for, sorting stuff like this out.  --[[User:MichaelTinkler|MichaelTinkler]]

Hmm. That all goes well beyond my level of scholarship. I guess I'll yank it. --[[User:WillWare|WillWare]]
-----
Well as I understand the Jews around the 1st century didn't have that clear ideas on the afterlife at all, and most Jews still don't. Some Jews today believe in reincarnation (some Hasidim for instance), though that belief may be Medieveal in origin. As to early Christianity, the mainstream rejected reincarnation, but some Gnostic groups believed in it. (Gnostic Christianity was heavily pagan influenced.) As to reincarnation in ancient Mediterranean society, I'd agree it was far from unanimous, but it wasn't just a philosophical view: some popular movements like Gnosticism or Orphism or Hermeticism believed in it. (I am no historian, so I may be wrong.) --- [[User:Simon J Kissane|Simon J Kissane]]
==first talks==

I've willing to expand the section on Spiritism, detailing more information as for the actual mechanisms of reincarnation under this particular doctrine. I suggest that Spiritismo (most specifically, Kardecist Spiritism) to get its own section, to help to point out its relationship to Christian doctrines (Kardecist followers have a different interpretation of the Bible, but consider themselves to be Christians). I don't want to step over anyone's toes on it, though.

:I encourage you to write the article. I myself would appreciate it. It may give people options. I'm more in into Edgar Cayce. Wikipedia, I believe is concerned with encyclopedicity, notability and originality/non-copyright-violating.

I may decide, sometime in the future, to move the Buddhist rebirth content to a separate article. [[User:Usedbook|Usedbook]] 16:14 21 May 2003 (UTC)

Is this view of Buddhist "rebirth" as opposed to "reincarnation" really an important point? For example, is this a distinction that the Buddha made, or any of this canonical interpreters, or this is some modern distinction?[[User:Kukkurovaca|&#2325;&#2369;&#2325;&#2381;&#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2379;&#2357;&#2366;&#2330;]] 03:00, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:Yes, it is definitely important.  Reincarnation is not a concept that fits with the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence and [[anatta]].  While the difference has apparently gone unnotice by many people through the centuries it is there from the very beggining.
:On the other hand, there is certainly a lot of people who believe Buddhism to include a belief in reincarnation.  So I must disagree with LordSurya; Buddhism should be mentioned here if only to clarify the matter. [[User:Luis Dantas|Luis Dantas]] 03:20, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::The question isn't, is there a difference between Buddhist and other views on the subject (as obviously there are), but rather, is this differentiation of ''terms'' one that reflects an original division, or is this merely a problem of translation? Because if we're only talking about different ''interpretations'' of samsara which are later translated as either reincarnation or rebirth, depending on the metaphysical implications, then the existing differentiation is much too strong. My assumption is that, if the Buddhists didn't have to coin a new term in Pali and/or Sanskrit (a linguistic world view in which if a new term could be coined, it would), we shouldn't place so much emphasis on this rebirth/reincarnation distinction.[[User:Kukkurovaca|&#2325;&#2369;&#2325;&#2381;&#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2379;&#2357;&#2366;&#2330;]]

:::It is partially a translation problem, but semantically it makes no sense to talk about "Buddhist reincarnation".  There are indeed different interpretations of Samsara, but the Buddhist version is called reincarnation only by those who lack adequate information.  Talking about "Buddhist reincarnation" as a legitimate concept leads to misunderstandings about the metaphysical perspectives.  I don't understand your argument - I don't know whether early Buddhists coined new words for the concept of rebirth or not (you seem to imply that they did not), but it is dangerous to assume that reusing existing words is a consequence of similar meanings.   From what I gather the early Buddhist Bikkhus used to have a much better grasp of their language and the respective context than we can offer with the often cursory material available in the present times. [[User:Luis Dantas|Luis Dantas]]

::::I seem to be involved in [[Talk:Sanskrit#Kukkurovaca|two debates]] about the importance of chosing the right word, and I'm not sure I'm on the same side of the debate in each. (grin) I don't know for sure that they didn't coin new terms in this regard, but I'm not familiar with any such, and I think I would have come across them if they had. 
::::If it was good enough for the Buddha to provide a new understanding of the old idea of samsara, and if the "rebirth"/"reincarnation" dispute is indeed of late vintage, I think we should reflect that in wp by (a) discussing Buddhism on the reincarnation page, and (b) specifying that the rebirth/reincarnation ''terminological'' differentiation is new. Obviously it's also of considerable importance (really, the actual issue) to specify how Buddhist concepts of samsara differ from those of other Indian philosophies.[[User:Kukkurovaca|&#2325;&#2369;&#2325;&#2381;&#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2379;&#2357;&#2366;&#2330;]] 04:17, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Since you keep mentioning "samsara", am I correct in guessing that this is the word that you translate as rebirth and/or reincarnation?  That would explain a lot of misunderstandings.  I tend to think of [[Samsara]] as the flow itself, not the process of participating in it. [[User:Luis Dantas|Luis Dantas]]

:(shrug) Samsara refers to the cycle of birth and rebirth, which is inclusive of the process. It's a verbal derivate, from sam&radic;sr; kind of like what "walking" is to "walk," if that makes any sense. 

:I just did a word search of the PTSD, (God bless the University of Chicago), and it translates two verbs as "be reborn", "ja" and "upa&radic;pad"; ja just means "be born", and "upa-pad" means, in this context, to come to be; neither has an association with re- anything. Which is interesting in itself. Some more digging turns up "vatta", which would correspond to Sanskrit "vrt", of which "pari-vrt" refers to transmigration. (Interesting--they drop the "re", not the other--but that doesn't really help us.) A little more digging turns up "sansr" as a verb (=samsr) and sansara (=samsara) as its derivate....[[User:Kukkurovaca|&#2325;&#2369;&#2325;&#2381;&#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2379;&#2357;&#2366;&#2330;]] 11:04, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::Interesting if not exactly conclusive research, thanks.  I take it that vatta/vrt is probably the root for [[avatar]].  If I understood you this time (and I guess not - this is complex stuff) the usual terms tend to emphasize the idea of birth/coming to be, not the idea of returning (except for avatar, which I understand doesn't really apply to regular human beings).  Perhaps the modern concept of reincarnation is a shortcut of sorts, combining aspects of the concepts of [[atman]] and of birth in the samsara? [[User:Luis Dantas|Luis Dantas]]

:::Not conclusive at all. I was reflexively indulging my inane tendency to reach for a dictionary at the drop of a hat. Sorry if I inundated you. Most of the terms seem not to emphasize repetition, and, importantly, not to emphasize the manner or metaphysical implication of what happens.

== Buddhist POV ==

I think that the section about Buddhist view of reincarnation should be edited, preferably by a Buddhist teacher or thinker since this is indeed a complicated subject. However, I don’t agree that there is a ''"fundamental disparity"'' between the concept of emptiness, space and mind and awareness. These are the same. ''"The form is empty, emptiness is form"'' from the Heart Sutra describes this relationship best. When it comes to the problem of soul and mind the analogy of sea and waves on it describes best the relationship between mind in general and particular sentient entities.

As I wrote, this is a complicated subject so I think any editing should be done with caution and by a person with deep understanding of it – therefore I decided no to do it myself. [[User:AndyBrandt|AndyBrandt]] 09:14, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:Well, you're absolutely right that the section was crap, and I've cut it down to a sliver with a "See also" note pointing to another page ([[Rebirth (Buddhist)]]) that does a better job on the subject. I vaguely recollect that the Buddhist material was split off to that page from this page; this new material seems to have arisen subsequently, and presents by its silliness a good argument to merge [[Rebirth (Buddhist)]] back into the main [[Reincarnation]] page.

:However, I think it's contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia to restrict editing to those who have deep knowledge of a subject, and I wouldn't want to see only committed religious authorities editing pages on religion. So please, edit away.[[User:Kukkurovaca| -- &#2325;&#2369;&#2325;&#2381;&#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2379;&#2357;&#2366;&#2330;]]|[[User talk:Kukkurovaca|Talk&#8253;]] 17:55, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Reincarnation vs. Metempsychosis ==

The beginning of the text of the article "Reincarnation" should be corrected:

- it says "Reincarnation, also called metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, is the rebirth in another body (after physical death) (...)"



a) Reincarnation (or Rebirth), which is the general rule (law) for Human evolution, in simple words works like this: each life in a human body, each time more developed and each time a bit more close to perfection.

In brief words in Reincarnation the individual stays around this physical world (as a spiritual entity in the etheric or vital plan) near to those places and persons who are familiar to him (it can stay for days, months or years after the death of physical body occurs - it depends on the individual evolution, awareness, his level of detattachement of physical world needs and things, etc); then he enters into others deeper spiritual (invisible) plans for centuries and returns a lot of time later into a new life in our physical world through rebirth as a baby inside the mothers' uterus.

Perhaps the best graphic on this subject can be found at [http://www.zyworld.com/jamus/LifeCycle.htm The Cycle of Life]; The graphic ant its terms belong to the [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng00.htm Rosicrucian Philosophy] but I am sure it works (its stages) fine with terms from other religious doctrines and spiritual teachings: REALITY is the same everywhere - the differences are the terms and perspectives of study used to describe it!


b) Metempsychosis (or transmigration of souls) is the incarnation of the individual (as an spiritual entity living in the etheric - vital plan after death of his physical body) in the body of an animal. It is NOT really incarnation (and less even a Rebirth) because:

1. there is no rebirth into a new life (for evolution purposes) - the individual who practices what is described as metempsychosis never leaves the physical earth environment (he stays in its etherical or vital counterpart) and this "take over" of an animal body (metempsychosis) occurs almost immediatly.

2. these only happens in very excepcional circunstances, happened more frequently in the past (centuries and thousands years ago), caused by extreme deviation of the individual towards some form of spiritual destruction (bloody black magic practices, extreme sexual abuse generaly associated to some form of black magic, primitive societies with canabalistic culture generaly in association to some tribal sourcery, etc).

3. ususally after death of the physical body the normal individual stays in its earthly familiar environment for days till years close to its family, friends, etc. Only those individuals with some kind of knowledge of occult (sorcereres, witches, xamanists, ...) and with great attachment to physical life due to heavy dark-low emotions (hate, sexual needs, blood thirst,...) were/are able to expel the group spirit of an animal and take its place in the body of the animal (which is not so complex as our human physical body).

4. As I said before this happened a lot in past times and in perhaps in all civilizations of the world, and could be seen by those who had clarividence faculty; and perhaps this is the reason why some of these seers took the metempsychosis as the general rule and not Reincarnation.


c) There is no such thing as incarnation in plants (vegetable kingdom); although they also possess a etheric-vital body and also its evolution works through a "group spirit" (like the animals), they have no organs which allows a conscious (awakened) conscioussness of the physical world. The entity which practices Metempsychosis needs similiar organs as the human physical body in the host body that it "takes over", animals have those organs (similiar to ours but far from being so complex) but plants have no such kind of organs.
I guess perhaps one reason why some doctrines thought human beings (after death of the physical body) could incarnate in plants/trees is due to the fact that some older trees in the path of evolution (as it happens to animals) are already acquiring some kind of individual conscioussness - that's evolution! And mystics in the past may have taken this individuality as a sintom of a human spirit having incarnated in the tree (which is juts NOT possible and also totally ilogical; even if it was a rare excepcion it had no way of happenning because this kind of direct interaction between totally diferent things does not occurs).


d) Reincarnation (Rebirth) is the rule (law); Metempsychosis (transmigration of souls) is a totally different phenomena which may happen in an extreme scenario and by the will of the personality of the individual that ceases his functioning  in the physical body (when death occurs) and looks immediatly for a victim (generally an animal, it can happen also among humans!) in order to stay connected to this physical world and to satisfy his low needs.


So, should the text be changed and perhaps explain these differences? or even create instead an article named "Metempsychosis"?

Edgar Cayce made the very plausible suggestion that we can be freed
from karma by grace. If this is so, then reincarnation is not contrary 
to the New Testament if we interpret "hell" as rebirth (same soul, different body).   
We keep repeating the cycle, not until we work off the karma as in eastern
religions, but are saved by faith and grace, as Paul's letter to the Romans.

Something to think about, anyway.

:Indeed.  Good contribution. [[User:Hawstom|Tom]] - [[User_talk:Hawstom|Talk]] 16:13, Nov 22, 2004 (UTC)

:Very nice.  Edgar Cayce allows me to maintain my Christianity and belief in Reincarnation. This is an article I contributed [[Edgar Cayce on Karma]]--[[User:Jondel|Jondel]] 04:41, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:* There is at least a western Christian school of thought that has Rebirth (reincarnation) and the  Law of Cause and Effect (karma) in its Christian teachings and very deeply explained. Please see the article [[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]] --[[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]] 01:20, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

---------------------------
Objection: How can souls be reincarnated when there are so many more living humans now than there ever have been before? Not enough souls to go around!

:There are many possibilities. For example:

:* Reincarnation does not preclude the production of new souls.

:* Circulation might be speeding up, maybe souls had to wait for centuries before being reincarnated, and are now reincarnated almost immediately.

:* Maybe, like the Hindus believe, souls are not exclusively human.

: -- [[User:Chris Q|Chris Q]] 07:51, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Also, Cayce mentions that a soul averages around forty years (even centuries)before incarnating except for this 19th and 20th century in which many souls in his reading have been taken as little as 4 or 5 years. This time period is supposed to be be very ideal for fulfillment of Karma, desires and evolution. e.g. there are so many living humans now because these others souls didn't want to incarnate before. Besides Earth is not the only place to incarnate. Souls don't just incarnate. They need ideal conditions or opportunities for evolution, growth and fulfillment. --[[User:Jondel|Jondel]] 11:27, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:* Maybe also: needs of evolution as mankind (colective) and human being (individual) at certain times like our own schools (where individual examinations are taken all the time and colective examinations are held at the end of main stages equal in all schools of the country - which, if this is correct, does not means the end but rather transition).

:* Maybe also: needs of an individual - as Higher entity evolving, not the personality - which may need sooner rebirth (than usual near a thousand years cycle) due to not having taken total or even none memory (the experience learned through his/her life) of his/her past life at the physical world. Donnot forget everywhere reincarnation and karma are taught also it is/was taught 3 to 3,5 days (84 hours) should be kept in silence - a kind of "memory transition period" - after a peaceful (disease/old age) death; and our societies donnot take this period yet into account and, on the other hand, violent deaths are each time more common in our societies due total immersion of conscience in the physical (and each time this conscience is more disconnected from the spiritual inside a large amount of human beings)).

:* Maybe also there were reasons - connected to the need of deeper physical evolutionary purposes - why rebirth (reincarnation), the law of cause and effect (karma) and the 3,5 days transition period (memory) were not publicly taught (till now...) in Christian, Jew and Muslim religious teachings (all these religions always have small groups teaching these three central conceptions in a more secretive way), but the Oriental religions have (deeper in earlier times) these teachings as external, public teachings. To understand it, and its implication in physical development, do not look at Religions as the physical organizations and its present and past individuals leading it, but as movements or expressions of something bigger unseen (like if each of them is/was the small visible portion over the ocean of an iceberg (which has its much bigger body unseen below the ocean)). --[[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]] 01:20, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Professor Frazer (Reply to Stevertigo) ==

Someone, I think Stevertigo, deleted a passage about Professor Frazer.  Now, I didn't write that passage and I do not have any personal investment in whether it should be kept out or put back in.  But if I understand SV's edit summary, he either doen't know the reference or wants it put in.  So: this refers to Sir James Frazer's ''The Golden Bough'' which was at the time it was first published (1890) one of the authoritative studies of religion and myth drawing from examples from around the world.  ''The Golden Bough'' has gone through several editions, including an abridgement I think in 1922 -- the point being that it is hard to provide a page reference that will be of use to the average reader.  Nevertheless, the passage in question (or the point) comes from the shapter "The external soul in forl-culture," specifically the section "The ritual of death and resurrection" (in the abridgement, this is chapter 67; in an earlier version it is volume II chapter four section four -- you get the idea, it is confuisng.  The book is widely available, but there is no one standard edition).  It seems to me that there is some place for this point in this article.

== Reincarnation vs transmigration ==

The introductory paragraph makes the distinction between reincarnation (human to human) and transmigration (involving humans and animals). The rest of the article however doesn't make this distinction anymore, only talks about "this doctrine" or "reincarnation". But Pythagoras, and many eastern religions, believe in transmigration, not just reincarnation. Right now, it looks like someone edited the introductory paragraph without changing the body of the article.

"'''''Intellectual arrogance''''': ''In addition to the normal kind of resistance with which any paradigm defends itself against change, the atheist paradigm of academia generally, and philosophy in particular, feels especially threatened by the findings of paranormal research. This is because intellectuals like to regard themselves as the highest manifestation of intelligence on the planet, if not in the universe. Embracing an evolutionary model according to which consciousness is correlated with brain development, intellectuals regard the human brain as the highest development of evolutionary forces, and an educated human brain as the highest of the high. Intellectuals like to feel that they are riding atop the crest of the wave of evolution.''<br/> 
''This intellectual smugness is greatly threatened by paranormal research, especially the NDE, the results of which strongly suggest (I am tempted to say "clearly show") that the human intellect is by no means the highest form of intelligence. (...)''"<br>

I have read them and they are not very good at all from very minor journals and in one case a yet to be refereed paper. The knowledge that this is superstition is what is valuable, and as your system of critique seems to be based on the stength of belief of the protagonist, I believe it to be superstition more stongly than you believe it to be valid knowledge.

: - There are no protagonists here; just individuals ''sharing'' knowledge, experiencies and also looking for answers. You would be suprised with the difference between what you may think I believe and what I do really believe and know within me. However, let us take another approach to this question:
*When you categorize the article "Reincarnation" as "Spirituality" it means, in general terms, is a subject accepted by people who follow or have a spiritual view of life (through a Religion, a Cult, in an eccletic way,...); When you categorize the article "Reincarnation" as "Esotericism", it means it was always taught among esoteric schools, movements, systems,  traditions. It is categorized in this way because it is known as a fact (the association of this subject to specific types or groups of individuals). But when you categorize it as a "Superstition" you are not categorizing through ''knowledge'' you posess; instead your are labeling it through a '''judgement of value''' from your own point of view about the subject (even if this point of view of yours may be common to the majority, it is still a judgement of value).
**An objective example from thousands of articles at wikipedia, a sport like [[Soccer]]: it is categorized as "Football (soccer)", "Olympic sports", "Team sports", ... Why? Because based upon knowledge about this subject and due to its caracteristics and so on it is logical to categorize it under those categories. But, suppose I don't like soccer and see it as a sport, based on emotions, turning people out of their normal social behaviour (ie if the team wins the league) and also a lucrative business to a few; like myself probably millions also do think in the same way: should I LABEL it in a "Fanatism" category? or in a "Business profitable" category? Logic and good-sense say it is not advisable.
**See, when you label things (not categorize), you give it a definition from your own point of view, a judgement of value. On the other hand, the term itself may be considered, as it is the case with your "Superstition" labeling related to article "Reincarnation" or "Pseudoscience" related to "Parapsychology", offensive to people who believe or know or work on the subject.
**You say the majority of human beings have the same judgement of value as yours. It may be so, but even if it was 99,9% against 0,1% it did not make them right about their perspective. Have you heard about [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and his [[Heliocentrism|Heliocentric theory]]? He belonged to 0,1% of the world of is time... need I say more?
*What I have said means: You accuse us of not being NEUTRAL and it is you who wants to establish a "Private or Biased Point of View" at the article! You are free ("The Free Encyclopedia") to post your knowledge against it or in favour of it; but, please do not make games with subjects which have to do with each individual: me, you or anyone at the world (it is not a simple data article about a game).
I will finish now, I had a lot more, but to a next encounter, to say about this subject and the type of actions toward Religious (or Spiritual oriented) articles at Wikipedia, not from people of Religious thought, but from people product of a [[Culture]] based on '''reducionist-positivist''' [[Science]] of 19th century, who relegate [[Religion]] and related subjects to a Cultural definition, or worse, as a '''Superstition'''. --[[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]] 18:28, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

* Boxed is right; our [[Wikipedia:NPOV|NPOV policy]] makes it inappropriate to refer to reincarnation as a superstition in Wikipedia.

I must say the whole article is very much POV. And while I certainly agree that science doesn't give final, or for that matter, thrutful answers all the time, what is being said here is that reductionist-positivist world outlook DOES support the theory of reincarnation, only that most scientists don't want to see this due do their own predjudices. This certainly isn't true. Believe me, scientists will believe ANYTHING, given enough evidence. So, I'd really like someone to rewrite the paragraphs about how mainstream science sees reincarnation, since, apart from that, the article is very good and informative.

==Questions==

Why does the article state at the beginning that there is a clear distinction between "[[reincarnation]]" and "[[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth in Buddhism]]"? This point is arguable and tendentious at best. As Kukkurovaca argues above, Buddhists have always had their own distinct ideas about reincarnation/rebirth. But I find it farfetched to think that a clear distinction has consistently been made between two concepts.

Also, from where does the idea arise that there is a distinction to be made between "reincarnation" and "transmigration"? I've never heard this before. I looked at [[Talk:Reincarnation#Reincarnation_vs._Metempsychosis]] above, but it appears to be based in some obscure POV, possibly relating to Rosicrucianism. - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Kraus]][[User_Talk:Nat Krause|e]] 05:46, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

:I too have never heard this distinction between reincarnation and transmigration. Both the dictionary definitions and a few web-sites visited seem to show them as synonymous. -- [[User:Chris Q|Chris Q]] 06:36, September 5, 2005 (UTC)


::The distinction I've heard is that '''reincarnation''' is the broader term that refers to any rebirth of a soul on the physical plane, while '''transmigration''' refers to rebirth from one species to the next.  It either could be in the sense of from a simpler form of life to one that is more complex, or in the special case where a human "regresses," usually back to an animal form.  This can happen when a person creates a particularly large  amount of "bad karma" in one's lifetime.  Noteworthy illustrations of transmigration would be when a soul changes in the number of "elements" that are dormant and active, such as from a plant to an insect, from an animal to a human (progressive transmigration) or a human to an animal (regressive transmigration). In the Bhagavad Gita, I believe Lord Krishna might have told Arguna a story about Shiva (?) walking around as an ant, but I don't remember any details, sorry. Here's a simple reference.

::Transmigration of the soul is true. We move from the simplest of forms to the increasingly complex."

*'''Rebirth''' (reincarnation) and '''Transmigration''' in most of religious/spiritual/esoteric teachings appear together and no clear answer is given about the difference towards human, animal, plants (and even mineral) life forms evolution process. 
:Does the Spirit (or whatever designation we give it) rebirths into any these life forms (even if in progressive or regressive way), or, is it as taught in a few teachings worldwide - as in the above related [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucianism (school)]] - that each of these life forms follow an independent evolution of their own and there is no rebirth of the Spirit among them? 
:This last way advocates that individual evolution at this time occurs with humans (animals and plants still are in a group Spirit evolution; yet, their path is toward individuality also). When it is said as above "We move from the simplest of forms to the increasingly complex." it does not mean we were animals or plants, according to these teachings: it means our consciousness in a far past was as the type of consciousness of animals (a "dream consciousness") and, earlier, as the consciousness of plants (a "dreamsleep consciousness") and before that time a "trance-like consciousness" (as it happens with minerals) [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen004.gif]. 
:Also each of this four life forms or kingdoms which make their evolution in the [[Physical plane|Physical World]] have the [[Subtle bodies]] related only to their present evolution, which also gives them their state of consciousness [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen003.gif]. '''Transmigration''', also known as '''Metempsychosis''', would only occur when a depraved human being comes in posession of an animal body, or even a human body, in extreme cases, as said in earlier discussion, and not as a Rebirth of the Spirit for evolutionary purposes [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen05c.gif] which, from this perspective, occurs in a more developed and sensible human body each life (and also each time forming a finer CHARACTER). --[[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]] 02:58, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:Removed from main article:
==Another theory of reincarnation that explains detailed knowledge and physical scars and symptoms==

Many reincarnationists make a fundamental assumption. The assumption is that cognition implies presence. It is assumed that if a person knows enough details about another’s life then that person used to be the other.  In other words, "if I remember a past life, then it has to be MY past life that I remember." 

But is there any reason for this to be the case? If someone were to know or be told in great detail the facts of a person who had died many years ago that would not indicate that you and this person had any link at all. 

In fact we can show evidence that it has happened that a person has had retrocognition and it was impossible for him to have been reincarnated.

The case of Peter Hurkos is the evidence as stated in his own autobiography. He talks about the first time he realized that he had a gift. He’d just suffered from a very severe head injury and was lying in a hospital bed when he noticed the man in the bed next to him. “All of a sudden he says that he knew an awful lot about this man despite the fact that he’d never seen him before. He then proceeded to tell the man everything that he saw about him and it proved to be accurate.
Hurkos later proved to be accurate 87% or more of the time. He helped the English police recover the royal coronation stone of Westminster Abbey because he knew great details about the thieves and in the same way he helped find the Boston Strangler. 

There were only 2 things different between this and reincarnation 
1. Most of the people that Hurkos knew about were still alive and 
2. Hurkos did not identify with them.

As mentioned, most reincarnationists argue that cognition indicates presence. “I could not know unless I was there.” But the facts from the cases of Peter Hurkos shows that that is not at all necessarily the case. Cognition does not indicate presence. If just indicates knowledge.

In the same way, a young child that merely knew in great detail events of someone else's life may be misled or not be able to comprehend why they know this without identifying with the person with whom they had retrocognition. 

Thus an alternate explanation is that Reincarnation could be simply retrocognition with identification.

But how can retrocognition occur. If one subscribes to the belief in multidimensional beings (which one always has to if one is a reincarnationist) then one has to subscribe to the belief that these multidimensional beings would also know the past history of any individual and thus could pass this information on to others who are yet alive. 

In some beliefs systems they believe this information is received through channeling. In certain religions when the channeling is unintentional and uncontrollable it is sometimes called demon possession. Thus most reincarnation could be explained as retrocognition caused by demonic possession with false identification. In addition the similar wounds and scars could be psychosomatic. Tests done using hypnosis have shown researchers the power of the mind, when told that a coin that was being pressed to their skin was hot enough to burn them, the skins of the hypnotized subjects would blister.

Thus to provide a complete alternative explanation, reincarnation could also be explained as Retrocognition caused by Demonic Possession with false identification and psychosomatic symptoms. 

This is one alternative theory that must be given due consideration when the evidence is being studied.

==Your words...==

With the edition you have ''rejected'' as a "minority" I've added the new article [[Metempsychosis]]: Why? Because it is a concept different from [[reincarnation]]. I do not accept also ''metempsychosis'' as a valid theory and I regard it - while theory (and not as a possible rare  phenomenon) - as a misinterpretation, created by some "gurus", from Sacred writings. Nevertheless, as it is a [[concept]] (and not new), it deserves an explanation and understanding (not to be hidden/deleted/reverted). My words are from a "minority", yet, I suggest you do some research in online and paper encyclopedias, as an e.g.:
 
::'''''Transmigration of souls''' or '''metempsychosis''' (mtm´´sk´ss) (KEY)  [Gr.,=change of soul], a belief common to many cultures, in which the soul passes from one body to another, either human, animal, or inanimate.'' (in The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.  2001-05)

::'''''Reincarnation''' (r´´nkärn´shn) (KEY)  [Lat.,=taking on flesh again], occupation by the soul of a new body after the death of the former body. Beliefs vary as to whether the soul assumes the new body immediately or only after an interval of disembodiment. Although some religions teach that it may inhabit a higher or lower form of life, most believe that the soul is consistently reincarnated in the same species. See transmigration of souls'' (Idem).

== [[Moral character]] vs. [[Character structure]] ==

Regarding the last change: disambig. link for '''character'''.
The conception to Reincarnation, as presented by sacred, religious and philosophical teachings behind this conception, is [[Moral character]]: [[Ethic]] and [[Moral]] patterns (see as e.g. "[[Ethic of reciprocity]]", also known as "Golden Rule") developed by the individual which lead him to true [[Spirituality]] (connection with the [[Spirit|Inner Self]], which will eventually guide the individual out of the Rebirth cycle, toward a higher level of [[Consciousness]]), and not fallacious arguments (I would say excuses) based solely in genetic features, which are unable to explain all the individual (inner) behaviour differences, diversity and originallity; or any psychological theories trying to explain [[abstraction |abstract]] processes, and as such also [[subjective]], as events inherent solely to the human [[mind]] (regarded by it as a product of the physical human brain; see also [[Mind]], [[Mind-body problem]], [[Philosophy of Mind]], [[Theory of mind]] and [[Mental body]]). Genetic features, analysed in the light of these Spiritual conceptions, have an important role but, from my point of view, they are predetermined through the interaction of the [[Plane (cosmology)|spiritual worlds]]' plan of [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] with the physical world, regarding its life ''forms'' (that we call "biological") development. --[[User:212.113.164.104|212.113.164.104]] 19:29, 30 November 2005 (UTC) [[User:GalaazV|GalaazV]]


:I think that my POV coincides with yours in this. I would, however, be interested in the opinions of Buddhists to this. The ideas of [[Pratitya-samutpada]] and [[Anatta]] could be seen as similar to [[character structure]]. I may be grossly misrepresenting Buddhism, but it seems to me that morality in Buddhism is almost a site-effect of right living, rather than a goal, and that right-living is aimed primarily at the self. Though I am personally happier with the [[Moral character]] link, maybe the NPOV answer would be to say  "[[Moral character]] and/or [[character structure]]". I will wait for further comments before making the change, however. -- [[User:Chris Q|Chris Q]] 07:53, 1 December 2005 (UTC)


::Well, it would be nice and welcome to hear the opinions of Buddhists regarding this subject. Not having a close familiarity with [[Buddhism]] - but kowing in advance they are very beautiful Teachings presenting very deep conceptions, and after studying the articles you refered - I found no similiarity with the psychologycal conceptions presented in [[Character structure]] article. Although one must agree with the conception, presented at that article, related to the early childhood development influence in building a character structure, as I see it, the conception of "character structure" creates the negation of any evolutionary form of the human character (or, better, "character" as representing the individual's degree of evolution toward an inner depth or a form of higher awareness); on the contrary, they try to establish a "relativity" of this human major feature, which according to them works like if it was a dispensable object: which can be of advantadge in some situations and regretable in other ("Fromm notes that character structures develop in each individual to enable him or her to interact successfully within a given society may be very counter-productive when used in a different society"). This view, as I see it, by itself excludes the link of "character structure" with any form of evolution leading to beyond the present stage of human and world physical limitations, and even less if this evolutionary path may be performed through the Rebirth cycle. So, my POV preference would still be: [[moral character]] conceptions.<br/>
::Related to the [[Anatta]] doctrine, and reading only from wikipedia, my POV would be more attuned to the interpretation given by Anatman (anatta) in the "Tathagatagarbha Sutras" ([[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] and the [[Tathagatagarbha Sutra]]), which strangely it appears to be also, according to the article, from a minority... ;).

:::In that case I will certainly leave the article unchanged. I would summarise the situation as follows: two non-Buddhists prefer the link to [[Moral character]] rather than [[Character structure]]. One thinks that [[Character structure]] might represent the Buddhist views more closely, the other thinks [[Moral character]] would also represent the Buddhist view. We clearly should not make a change, though a Buddhist may want to ammend this later. -- [[User:Chris Q|Chris Q]] 09:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

Bumpusmills, I love that you wrote that Judaism doesn't embrace it, since I agree; however you must know that it is very possible that the majority of [[Orthodox Judaism]] nowadays do accept reincarnation in one form or another.  Yet there are still a few segments of Orthodox Jews who officially reject reincarnation (i being a member of one of them), as is clarified in the Judaism section of the Reincarnation article.  It is most likely that the most passionate of those Jews who are against reincarnation and other Kabbalistic innovations are to be found among [[Dor Daim]] and other students of the [[Rambam]].  I like the point you made about how all three came down from Abraham.  It is undeniable that there is NO clear evidence that Jews historically accepted reincarnation.  Most proponents of reincarnation among Orthodox Jews explain this by saying that it was secretly passed down generation after generation among the greatest of rabbis.  If this is so, how then did they suddenly get permission to reveal this 'secret' to the world only in the 1300's WITHOUT the authority of the [[Sanhedrin]]? (Anyone who understands the function of the Sanhedrin in Jewish/Talmudic law knows the power of this question.) Anyway, this isn't the place to discuss the issue.  You can find such discussion on www.mesora.org   -- Yosef in Jerusalem

==early Christian views of reincarnation==
I have heavily modified this section in light of Eggenstein's research, which seems well-founded. I suggest that anyone read [http://www.j-lorber.de/kee/3/r-reinca.htm this article] before making further changes to this section; it surprised me and will surely surprise most readers.

Reply from JMO, April 17 2006: I looked at the Eggenstein
article, and though I saw some quotes
said to be from church figures, none of the numerous footnotes actually
cited a specific source of that type; instead, they all cited modern
books by other defenders of reincarnation.  I also spent a little time
trying to track down the quote attributed to Gregory of Nyssa, and couldn't
find it, but did find some other quotes that imply that he rejects 
reincarnation.  Until someone can actually come up with a supporting
quote with a direct citation from a recognized Church father, some of
the claims about reincarnation in the early Church need to be dialed back.

Reply from Practical123, August 17, 2006:  I agree with JMO.  The Eggenstein article
is hardly scholarship.  I seriously doubt that Eggenstein has bothered to read
the Church Fathers he cites.

==Buddism correction==
Buddhism teaches reincarnation is not of a permanent self or soul but says the opposite view is also an error. Buddhism is not unified as to what that actually means and some might stress the view of no self, while the teachings of Hinduism might stress the view of everything is ultimately self.<br><br>
was added 17feb06 to correct statements made about buddhism which seem to tend towards the 
false view that buddhism teaches that there is no self at all.

==Suggestions==

I notice that there are a few arguments missing in the "objections" section, otherwise worthy of further discussion. One of wich could be the following: if incarnation indeed is true, how does it account for the changing population numbers of each species, especially humans? The current population growth ratio is about 95 million/year new human "souls". Thousand years ago there were less than a billion people - where did the new "souls" come from? If reincarnation is not limited to a particular species, say if it is possible for any living thing with recognized consciousness to reincarnate into a human, then, there is still the dilemma of variable total count of conscious beings available (with many living species going extinct each year, for example).

If the soul can reincarnate into any type of animal, plant or human body on any planet in the universe (as described in the [[Bhagavad Gita]]), then I don't really think the above argument causes a problem. (Just think how many souls are existing right now as insects or bacteria - even in a small space of grass in field they are literally countless, what to speak of across the universe) It could be worth mentioning as an argument against souls only reincarnating in human bodies however?

==Hgilbert Reversion==
Hello Hgilbert - I see you reverted my edits completely.

How is it less clear? Are you happy with the page as it was? [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 11:42, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

The edits seem to mostly move material around. In the overview section, it is not appropriate to have a detailed focus on one particular area, though I appreciate your intention to relate the various ideas about reincarnation to the philosophical conception of the soul. Similarly with other areas...why are you shifting the text around? Also, your textual edits (on the various kinds of reincarnation) leave out some helpful distinctions, and are generally less descriptive and possibly inaccurate (New Age??). It does not help that the English of your additions is often ungrammatical or obscure. In addition, an encyclopedia is not the place to put in your own musings on a subject; the content should be factual and sources should be able to be cited (preferably actually cited through footnotes or bibliography, though this is not always the case in the Wikipedia).

I am going to revert again for these reasons. I hope you understand. I think it would be better to work within the existing framework, supplementing it with meaningful and verifiable additions, rather than to go with a new structure. [[User:Hgilbert|Hgilbert]] 12:51, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

 
Hello [[User:Hgilbert|Hgilbert]] - I have not reverted back again but please address the following if you have time. I appreciate your honest approach and agree that my edits were far from perfect, however there are serious technical innacuracies in the current version which I believe need to be rectified as per below:

* 1) How can the concept of the [[Afterlife]] be mentioned at the top of a list on forms of reincarnation? Most people would never even identify the concepts of the 'afterlife' and 'reincarnation' in being at all connected.

* 2) The below section on 'reincarnation' is vastly innacurate. The word 'reincarnation' simply means

:* a) ''a rebirth of a mental capacity, such as a soul, in a physical life form, such as a body'' or 
:* b) ''the idea of such a rebirth, a specific belief or doctrine on how such a rebirth occurs'', 

thus transmigration is also a form of reincarnation. How can this description claim to be 'what is strictly known as reincarnation'? As well as that it is very badly written and not at all encyclopedic: 

:* '''[[Reincarnation]]''': People die, go through [[Plane (cosmology)|inner planes]] and return, rebirth, (usually or often) as new human beings. Strictly, it is this which is known as '''reincarnation''' (also called "rebirth"). In many versions, eventually there is the potential to escape the cycle, e.g. by joining [[God]], [[Enlightenment (concept)|enlightenment]], some kind of [[self-realization]], a [[born again|spiritual rebirth]], entering a spiritual realm, etc. (There is some confusion, in general society, between reincarnation and transmigration; see below for comparison)

* 3) The paragraph starting ''It may be asked how reincarnation fits into this picture. In a word, for Buddhism it doesn’t fit at all...'' surely is of more relevance to the section on Buddhism? For the article to be neutral how can we dedicate such a large section of text to explore a specific form of philosophy over any others in the overview section?

* 4) In terms of simple readability and structure - can we really say that the current overview section even reads well? Or is it simply a number of lengthy paragraphs put together without any common thread. There seems to be no structure in it. Nor does it address clearly the main views and points in reincarnation. I feel it somewhat of a travesty just to leave it in the current state. 

Even if you do disagree with my recent edits personally - do you at least admit much work needs to be done on the above? Does anyone else feel differently or agree with the above? 

Best Regards, [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 14:31, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

Thank you very much for your thorough review above. I have tried to edit the text taking into account all of your excellent points.

You've (83.84.186.232) defined the additions you've made to the scientific section as 'crucial' - can you clarify as to why? This article is ''enourmous'' so it is important to not simply continue to add content unless it is meaningful. Your additions provides examples of people who claim they were reincarnated and their personal evidence, etc, but that section already covers that. So how much of this is enough? There are many, many, many examples of people who claim and give evidence to have been reincarnated, but I don't think the article should be forced to have all of them. Why are your additions crucial and why can't they be summarised, considering the article is already bloated, and what is to stop others from continueing to add more to that section until it just gets even more ridiculous? You should also get a profile to facilitate discussion and feedback. [[User:MaxMangel|MaxMangel]] 10:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

Ramsters work provides almost conclusive evidence for reincarnation, that why it's crucial. I have read many books that attempt to prove reincarnation, and Ramsters books really stands out. What Buddhists believe and what Hindoes believe, not to mention hundreds of sects, seems irrelevant to me compared to the truth about reincarnation. Ramster seems to get closer to the truth than anyone else, which is why it is not ridiculous to include a summary of his findings. Does reincarnation exist or does it not exist, and if yes, how? That is the question. Beliefs are irrelevant.

==Should this be included as a form of 'Reincarnation'? - Please discuss==

:==== Life extension and artificial reincarnation in Transhumanism ====
:It has been suggested by some [[Transhumanism|transhumanists]] that a form of reincarnation could be artificialy created without real death. This idea is one of those used to allay the feeling about [[Life extension|vastly extended lifespans]] meaning boredom. 

:The memories of a living being could be partially or totally erased. He would then be able to rediscover what he had willingly forgotten, maybe even since birth. He would then be able to live a new "life".

:Scientists are already considering pills that would be designed to forget specific experiences (currently, traumatic ones), and studies of current [[Amnesia|amnesias]] are progressively unraveling the mechanisms of forgetfulness.

:In the more futuristic context of [[mind uploading]], erasing of selected memories would almost surely be relatively easy.

Thoughts and comments from any angle are appreciated. Ys, [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 15:56, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you for this discussion ^_^. The idea of 'artificial reincarnation' is of course the idea of a minority.

Please support the diversity of points of view ! ^_^ [[User:Wowulu|Wowulu]] 13:26, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

::I would argue that the above does not come under the classification of reincarnation as described in this article:
:::(from the introduction) "Reincarnation, literally "to be made flesh again", as a doctrine or mystical belief, holds the notion that some essential part of a living being (or in some variations, only human beings) can survive death in some form, with its integrity partly or wholly retained, to be reborn in a new body."
::A method by which a person may loose their memories is somewhat different to taking re-birth in another physical body. I don't see how you could classify it as reincarnation. Isn't it simply a 'fresh start'? [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 19:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

:The idea is that it would be subjectively similar to reincarnation in the usual meaning. Of course it wouldn't be the same, the body would be the same one and there is no mystical meaning in it. But there is also a notion of 'fresh start' in traditional reincarnation, and memories of past lives would be similar to a partially erased memory.

:Anyway, while still hoping for more discussion on this topic, I've added a link in the 'See also' section. I hope it's ok. ^_^ [[User:Wowulu|Wowulu]] 12:20, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:Indeed I think 'complete memory loss after a disease or accident' is somewhat subjectively similar to reincarnation. Anyway I won't argue any further since I realize that the majority will disagree. I only hope that the 'See also' link won't be deleted, because the concept of 'artificial reincarnation' is inspired by the concept of 'reincarnation'. Thanks ^_^.

==Swadhyayee edits from Hinduism ==
'''To the editors of the reincarnation article:'''  A frequent contributor to the Hinduism article, Swadhyayee, posted the following paragraphs on the Hinduism article.  I have removed them becasue they could be written more clearly, and because they were somewhat redundant and add too much detail to what was already on Hinduism page regarding reincarnation.  I don't disagree with the content of what he wrote, but I think the language needs some polishing.  If anybody who is working on this page would like to help him polish it and post it on the reincarnation page, I'm sure he would appreciate it. Thanks. [[User:HeBhagawan|HeBhagawan]] 13:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)


The doctrine of reincarnation, according to Hinduism, states that everything one does, leave imprints in one's mind and intellect, which determines what kind of life one would be in next birth or possess tendencies if born as human.  If, one regularly perform good motivated actions, one will develop good tendencies. If, one do bad motivated things, one would develop bad tendencies, which naturally can cause bad things to happen in one's life.  Since Hinduism believes in [[reincarnation]], it follows that one's actions in this life can determine what kind of tendencies one will be born with in subsequent lives. Virtuous actions purify the mind and intellect and help the soul to be closer to the Supreme Divine and lead to a birth with higher consciousness/conscientiousness.  Evil actions hinder this recognition of the Supreme Divine, and the soul takes lower forms of worldly life.  Therefore, Hinduism teaches, one should try to behave in a virtuous manner as much as possible, so that one will develop good habits and tendencies both in this and the next life. Over the course of time, if one can sufficiently purify one's mind, one can attain the goal of life: experience of the highest truth, which is God.

As per Hinduism doctrines, the immortal soul leaves the body and the soul accepts new body in accordance with Karmas and Desires of previous birth/births.  Intellect and mind move along with the soul and so the new body exhibit tendencies of previous birth/births ( i.e. pious, evil, selfish, vengeful, selfless, noble etc.) and also reflect same intellectual level.  Further, humans only possess the developed intellect (ability to think and assess) and the human body possesses necessary limbs (Karmendriyas)[ ability to speak, hear, read and do actions by hands ] to carry out actions leading to realisation of God, so the humans must endeavour to merge with The Infinite.  When a person fails to merge with The Infinite, the sublimated intellect and mind move along with The Soul in each life and usually The Soul gets the human body to carry on the journey of merging with The Infinite in subsequent births.  This doctrines imbibe in Hindus to be alert on the matter of journey towards The Infinite and involve in such actions which if fail to merge the soul with The Infinite after the death, at least reward with next life as humans.

== The Esoteric Interpretation ==

[[User:Ksolway]] 13 November 2006 (UTC)

There needs to be an explanation of the interpretation of reincarnation which sees it as a means of talking about cause and effect, which some people call "the esoteric interpretation" because it involves no literal reincarnation.

I don't see this understanding of reincarnation explained anywhere in the current article.

Under what heading and where do you suggest this explanation should be placed in the article?

I suggest the following:

"There is an interpretation of reincarnation that does not involve literal rebirth. In this interpretation, reincarnation is simply a poetic way of talking about cause and effect.   
   
Here, reincarnation refers to the continued life of the imputed I, the ego, which is a false thought, or ignorance. Just as one lights a candle from the flame of another, so are false thoughts passed from person to person. These thoughts are false because they believe they experience loss and gain, life and death. It is because these thoughts believe in life and death, they are said to be caught in the cycle of repeated birth and death.   
    
The Buddha famously explains this esoteric interpretation in [http://members.optushome.com.au/davidquinn000/Buddhist%20Writings/Kutadanta.htm "The Questions of Kutananda"], where he explains in detail the process of reincarnation when a candle flame is used to light another candle.   
    
Some quotations which reflect the esoteric interpretion:   
    
<blockquote>   
"If I can see further than others, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants." - Isaac Newton   
</blockquote>   
    
<blockquote>   
"One sows and another reaps." - The Bible: John 4:37   
</blockquote>   
    
<blockquote>   
"No man, not even a married man, can know definitely how many children he leaves behind him." (author unknown)   
</blockquote>   
    
<blockquote>   
"It is a mistaken conception to think,<br />   
That I shall experience the suffering of my next life.<br />   
For it is another person who dies,<br />    
And another who will be reborn." - Shantideva ("Guide to the bodhisattva's way of life")   
</blockquote>   
    
<blockquote>   
"Children do not have as much fun in childhood as adults do in adultery." - Spike Milligan   
</blockquote>

:I would say that the article: [[Rebirth (Buddhist)]] is probably the best place for any in-depth investigation of this type as it sounds very similar, if not identical, to the Buddhist perspective on reincarnation/rebirth. Ys, [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 16:06, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

Response (Ksolway): In that case I propose distinguishing between the exoteric (common) and esoteric interpretations of reincarnation, within the Buddhist category. Most Buddhists believe in the more traditional type reincarnation, which is linear. For example, Tibetan Buddhists believe that the current Dalai Lama is the reincarnation of the former, in a narrowly linear line, from one life to the next.  By contrast, the esotericists hold that reincarnation goes in strict accordance with the pattern of cause and effect, which is not narrowly linear. For example, "One sows and another reaps", which is not narrowly linear, and is explained in "The Questions of Kutananda" (link above).  

The problem here is that the esoteric view is not limited to Buddhism, but is universally held.  For example, by those in advaita vedanta, who do not believe in the duality of lives, or the duality of life and death.

For that reason I propose a separate category for the universal, esoteric interpretation.

Your views appreciated.


:The word esoteric implies something which is "confined to and '''understandable by only an enlightened inner circle'''" or "a compilation of esoteric philosophical theories", so logic would assert that to use it (esoteric) as a descriptive word in this context is not really encyclopedic, it would be [[pov]]. It promotes this specific philosophical understanding as being 'special' and 'different' to the others on the page.

:We already have from the Buddhist section:
:*"Since according to Buddhism there is no permanent and unchanging self (identify) there can be no metempsychosis in the strict sense. However, the Buddha himself referred to his past-lives."

:and concerning Advaita from the Hinduism section:
:*"For example, followers of the Advaita Vedanta school (often associated with jnana yoga) believe ... that the immortal soul is part of that existence. Thus they will no longer identify themselves as individual persons, but will see the "self" as a part of the infinite ocean of divinity, described as sat-chit-ananda (existence-knowledge-bliss)"

:There are so many different philosophies and ideologies concerning reincarnation that to include them all would be impossible. Is there a particular group that notably follows the reincarnation theory you would like to include, other than Advaita and Buddhist schools which are already covered? To give a vague 'universal' section on the matter would be out of place in my opinion, unless it differs significantly from the Buddhist or Advaita philosophies included already? Ys, [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 09:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

Response (Ksolway):  You are right that the word "esoteric" implies something which is "confined to and understandable by only an enlightened inner circle". But should truths/ideas be excluded from an encyclopaedia just because only wise or informed people understand them? I don't think so.

For example, since very few people really know "God" (if any), then there should be no entry for "God". And since very few people understand quantum physics, there should be no entry for quantum physics - since the only people who can verify the truth of these things are those in the "enlightened inner circle".

However I will think about editing the Buddhist section in some minor way to emphasise the non-linear, non-simplistic understanding of reincarnation.
== The article needs focus and a better structure ==

[[User:Carribeiro|CarlosRibeiro]] 22:12, 28 October 2006 (UTC) - In my opinion this article grew way to much, and needs more focus, or a better structure. Section boundaries are not being respected, and some views on the subject take a disproportionate amount of space. Due to the discussion on the scientific aspects regarding reincarnation, there has been a lot of editing; information on hinduist beliefs also takes a lot of space.

I believe this page should be a starting point for those looking for information regarding reincarnation. Specific views or beliefs should be discussed either into their own pages, or strictly inside a specific section. Adding more text to this page only makes it more confusing and less helpful to the casual reader. I propose the page to be split in such a way that only the main arguments from all sides are presented here, and details are discussed in the specific topic.

: I agree that this page has become unfocused and without a coherant structure over time. However it makes sense to me that Hindu & Buddhist perspectives on reincarnation be explored in some amount of depth (as at present) because the theories of reincarnation and re-birth are essential to thier overall philosophies. The Jainist perspective should probably be mentioned in a more detailed manner than at present, but I'm aware this would make the page longer still. It's going to be a big job to fix up the article as a whole as there as just so many viewpoints on the subject. For me the intro is okay - it's the later sections and some kind of 'concluding' paragraph that is lacking. Ys, [[User:GourangaUK|GourangaUK]] 11:14, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

This 'Concluding Comment' section has no citations to its reference that "Reincarnation is once again attracting the minds of intellectuals and the general public in the West". Citations are required to indicate that this section is not just speculation.

==Proposed New Page: Reincarnation and Hinduism== 
 
I feel that the topic of "Reincarnation and Hinduism" is a major one which deserves its own page, in much the same way that the topic of [[Rebirth (Buddhist)]] has its own page.  It could contain all the material in the existing Hinduism section here, and  more.  We could then refer readers to the new page at the start of the Hinduism section of this article, instead of referring to [[Samsara]], as we do now, which is about much more than Hinduism.

: Have made this change. [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] 03:55, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
:: Theory of reincarnation started in Upanishads as stated here in this article. Separating hindu part in some other page and then linking is more like cheating as re-incarnation is associated more with hinduism than any other religion. Even other religions borrowed it from hinduism. If two concepts are tightly coupled than creating separate pages almost cheats the reader by giving incomplete story.[[User:Skant|Skant]] 02:36, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
::: The page size limit for wikipedia should be raised so that an article can grow upto 5-6 pages if needed. With good internet browsers and good scrolling facilities/ page-size adjustments available in browsers, viewing 5 pages by scrolling is less difficult and much faster than moving between links of different pages (so if context needs information to be together, then we should try to keep it together and shouldn't use page-size as an excuse to make things less informative or irrelevant, this should actually be debated by wikipedia and let us see what arguments we can have!).[[User:Skant|Skant]] 02:36, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

== POV ==
I have added the POV because of a strong bias in the structure and tone of this article.  The scientific research section is my primary concern, however the rest of the article has a biased tone as well.  Take this for example;

"Some scientists and skeptics, such as Paul Edwards, have analyzed many of these accounts. In every case they apparently found that further research into the individuals involved provides sufficient background to weaken the conclusion that these cases are credible examples of reincarnation. Philosophers like Robert Almeder, having analyzed the criticisms of Edwards and others, say that the gist of these arguments can be summarized as "we all know it can't possibly be real, so therefore it isn't real" - an argument from lack of imagination."

The structure alone points a a reincarnation bias.  By including both arguements for and against the existance of reincarnation in the same section the article seems to be presenting a viewpoint then promptly shooting it down.

Another area of concern is the "Contemporary movements and thinkers" section.  The majority of groups listed in this section are religous.  By catagorizing them as "Contemporary movements and thinkers" the article seems to give them some sort of legitamacy in a encyclopedic or scientific context.  Religions are by definition based on faith.  Therefor they cannot be used to provide scientific support or critisizem for any topic.  If this section was named "Religious view of reincarnation" it would be far more neutral.  As it stands it is unacceptable and when I have a bit more time I will change it.  There are many other problems similer to this and I suggest that a total restructering be done, which I would be happy to help with.
[[User:Foolishben|Foolishben]] 01:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

:From my perspective the title '''Contemporary movements and thinkers''' is general enough to cover the information given and wouldn't agree that the title in itself constitutes a strong [[WP:POV|bias]]. The scientific section is seperated below under a different header. Not all viewpoints in the Contemporary section are necessarily ''religous'' - unless anything concerning reincarnation is to be classified in that way. What do others think? It could do with a tidy-up maybe to remove any POV remarks? Regards, [[User:GourangaUK|Gouranga(UK)]] 12:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

::Gouranga, Thanks for shifting the NPOV tag.  I agree with what you have said, although I have suggested a new section heading: "Contemporary perspectives".  And I would also like to see a new sub-section relating to "Reincarnation in popular western culture", eg., films, novels, songs, which could help to reduce the perceived religiosity of the article as a whole.  I have also reduced the length of the Hinduism and Buddhist sections slightly.  And, yes, the tidy-up you mention is a good idea. [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] 06:57, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

: The paragraph begining 'Some scientists and skeptics, such as Paul Edwards...' is still very biased. Edwards being described as 'skeptic' while Robert Almeder is described as 'Philosopher' not 'Supporter' shows a degree of bias. Also, Almeders statment describing an 'argument from lack of imagination' is in no way a valid argument against Edwards views (See article on the Flying Spaghetti Monster for an example). Adding fallicies such as this undermine the reliability of this section.[[User:Aequitas1234|Aequitas1234]] 16:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:: Have removed the implication that Paul Edwards is a skeptic, but would make the general comment that it's actually quite difficult to do justice to everyone's views in such a small section, which is why the main [[Reincarnation research]] article is referred to.

:::This last comment by [[User:Johnfos|Johnfos]] is typical of the vast hogwash that characterizes the article itself.  There is NO credible attempt to present a balanced view of reincarnation.  '''No one''' has suggested that the article should ''do justice to everyone's views'' -- this is a "straw man" -- a bogus goal mentioned for the sole purpose of refuting it.  What '''is''' essential for this article to be remotely worthy of not being removed entirely is a credible section containing views of those who hold that there does ''not'' exist adequate evidence to believe in reincarnation.   There are a large number of scientists, for example, who have pointed to the absence of any credible evidence to date in favor of reincarnation, but there is '''no''' attempt to present '''any''' of these views, no less ''everyone's views''.

Henry Trigg is mentioned in sites about Stevenage, Hertfordshire because of the coffin which was in the barn until the 1940s. The incident of his burial and expected return is listed in the XXI Annual volume of the Gentleman's Magazine for 1751, February, page 91.  Thus there are evidential sources for Trigg's existence.  As to "notability", surely the exclusion of a fact or person just because lots of people don't already know about it/them is a nonsense. On that basis, no unknown fact would be published on Wikipedia!  Surely the encyclpaedia is there to inform about what is not known, or to clarify what is not fully understood.  This article should welcome balance by including someone who has not notoriety like Patton and was in an ordinary position and yet had an extraordinary belief in his reincarnation.

==Added information on William Butler Yeats==
Yeats' theory of reincarnation as expressed in A Vision deserves note, especially since it is rather unique (not dependent on linear time).  This seems congruent with certain ideas current in quantum physics (such as e.g. probable realities; that time is not linear but multiply ramified).

According to Swammerdam there shouldn't be any time dependence between previous and next lives.

'One of the scientific theories of reincarnation could be found in Johann Swammerdam's book "Karma for Dummies". A pity, it has been never published, but only some it's parts [45] can be found in the net."


1. Johann Swammerdam lived in the 1600's. The "For Dummies" series started in the 1990s.

2. The only page referencing this fictitious work is the one listed. Said link is all gibberish.

3. I would am going to delete this reference if I can.

Wonderful. 

1.Have you ever heard about people with similar names? Obviously, it's NOT Swammerdam from 17 century.
2.Yes, it's the only link I found.
3.It's the ONLY explanation made me and some of my friends understand that reincarnation can be real. It seems to be much more interesting than various idiotic reports about various people who claim that they have seen other people, who told that they remember that they lived before...

It's not proved. There is zero evidence that it is it true or demonstratable. reincarnation is a belief, and not one shared by everyone. it perfectly complements the human desire for immortality resulting from the fear of death and mortality.

Yes, you are absolutely right, I am new here. And I am not going to spend much time improving the world. But some of my friends and me are sure we should share this link with others. You can check - the guys from RIS don't even bother to seed the links to their site.

You also may be absolutely right that the link I try to save doesn't complain some rules. And I am absolutely sure that the formal view will allow to remove about a half of the links in the article. Shall we?

You also are absolutely right, I've been blocked for 3RR breach. No problem.

Well, you really seem to be a person who can be right. But the harmony is not in being right.

I won't spend time in typing why the concept of reincarnation is important to me and to some more people around me. The idea is that for long years I had no explanation how such process can take place in our world. When I found the text, I was impressed. Yes, it's not clean, it needs some efforts to understand the language... I don't care. Now I KNOW that there is logically, physically and mathematically explained reason to include reincarnation in skeptical mind. I am sure that other people who need to KNOW rather than to trust will appreciate this set of thoughts.

Reliable publications are those with an established structure for fact-checking and editorial oversight. A world-renowned mathematician may not be a reliable source about biology.

Not all the links are published works, if we mean paper.

== Josephus/Reincarnation in Judaism ==

This part seems way off to me. The reference given after the quotation is simply to the full text of Book II of Josephus's The War of The Jews. Therefore it's not a reference to someone saying that's what Josephus was talking about, and the idea that he was referring to reincarnation seems to be the writer's own interpretation. Possibly that even counts as original research, I'm not sure, but it seems to be unsubstantiated by any other research. In any case, it would seem to me to be far more likely that what Josephus was getting at was the Pharisees' belief in a physical resurrection of the dead at the end of the world, as opposed to the Sudducees who did not believe in the resurrection (the Bible records that they once tried to get Jesus to side with them on this, see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:23-33;&version=31; Matthew 22:23-33]).

So, it seems to me that there isn't anything (or at least anything unambiguous) to suggest that the Pharisees believed in reincarnation in the time of Josephus, and that that part of the article ought to go. [[User:Jenesis|Jenesis]] ([[User talk:Jenesis|talk]]) 20:08, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

==Classical Greek Philosophy==

'''Gouranga(UK)''':  Please be so kind as to not summarily reverse my edits, especially not based on a false attribution of bad motives!  I am a scholar and simply wish to see the facts accurately reported.  If there were evidence, for example, that Socrates believed in reincarnation I would be the first to state it.  Note that in the previous version, no authoritative references were supplied in the Greek philosophy section.  If you disagree, may I suggest that a more appropriate response is to supply counter-evidence, not to delete all edits.

The case of Pythagoras can perhaps be conceded (but only in a short article; the issue is actually  fairly complex, for we don't have any writings from Pythagoras himself, and must rely on hearsay, much of it biased).  

For Socrates, any student of Greek philosophy knows that, again, we have no written works by him.  I could show with dozens of scholarly citations that a belief in reincarnation is not generally attributed to Socrates.  However, the burden of proof is on the one who makes the positive assertion -- in this case, the claim that Socrates did believe in reincarnation.  Note that the quotation in the original article is not from Socrates himself, but from Plato, who uses Socrates as a fictional character in the dialogue, ''Phaedo''.  As I pointed out, the writer Xenophon, who wrote an actual historical biography of Socrates, does not mention reincarnation.  How can you justify removing such an obviously relevant fact as that?

In the case of Plato, opinion is about evenly divided as to whether he believed in reincarnation or not.  I would like to give the reader the benefit of both sides of the opinion.  Previously, only one side was presented.  Do you not agree that, in an encyclopedia article on reincarnation, all sides should be fairly presented?  

Concerning Christianity, the popular myth that early Christianity taught reincarnation is so absurd that any serious historian would find it ridiculous.  

Finally, even if it were my wish to promote some kind of general 'anti-reincarnation' view, which your brief comment seemed to falsely imply, that alone is not grounds to reverse the edits.  People of all opinions are entitled to supply additional facts and points to this neutral article (that is what makes it neutral and objective).  However, if you summarily negate the opinions of those you disagree with, then *that* is what makes the article biased -- would you not agree?

If you disagree with any of my edits then please say so here, and we can address each issue individually.  However, my sincere wish is that you simply leave the edits as-is, on the principle of "good faith" (see top of this page).  Otherwise, after much pointless discussion, and wasted time on both our parts, you will see that all my edits are factually based.

In any case, it is not polite to simply delete an entire set of edits, giving no consideration to the time and effort the other person put into placing them, checking references, etc.

: I made a minor change to the description of the Phaedo dialogue used in this page; I omitted the word "fictitious" from the description. The Dialogues are Plato's philosophy, written in the dialectic. It is, I know, debatable how much of dialogues represent the accurate philosophy of Socrates, and what parts that of Plato. I understand the common consensus to think of it as both. With regards to Plato directly, please consider the introduction by Huntington Cairns in the Bollingen Series LXXI, Collected Dialogues: 
<blockquote>
:: [Plato] was poet, thinker, scientist all in one and there has been no such combination of powers displayed by anyone before or since. to understand Plato is to be educated; it is to see the nature of the world in which we live. The vitality of what he has to say is due to one factor. He took his point of departure from what is and not from what man wants. One by one he took up the great problems and if he did not solve them he left them at least in a framework in which subsequent ages could see them in their essential nature. He as been misunderstood, and adapted to points of view completely antithetical to his own; but these aberrations have always run their course, and it is by a return to Plato's insights that the thought of the West has continually renewed itself.
</blockquote>
: It should be noted that Socrates (Plato) does not effectively prove reincarnation, nor disprove it for that matter, it is presented in the Phaedo as a mystical concept, and left open for choice of the individual to believe in or not to believe in.

== Relationship to Shaivism and Sri Ramakrishna ==

"The followers of full or partial Dvaita schools ("dualistic" schools, such as bhakti yoga), on the other hand, perform their worship with the goal of spending eternity in a loka, (spiritual world or heaven), in the blessed company of the Supreme being (i.e Krishna or Vishnu for the Vaishnavas, Shiva for the Shaivites). [9]"
Note the above text: firstly, Sri Ramakrishna is not a Dvaitan, I have Gospel of Ramakrishna and I would like to know which page this was taken from...Sri Ramakrishna is an Advaitan but not pure Advaitan, he relates to the real existence of God/dess(Kali for him) but he does follow the ideal of becoming one with pure Brahman...
Secondly: The majority of Shaivites do not believe in Dualism, they practice a form of Advaita(Isvaravada)- [[monistic theism]]..Thus their supreme loka is Parashiva/Parabrahman, so thus they are not going to live with Shiva in a loka(although shiva is brahman-think about shivo'ham I am Shiva, and also all is shiva) in the sense of a heavenly plane that refers to mainly Vaishnavism..[[User:Domsta333|Domsta333]] ([[User talk:Domsta333|talk]]) 05:34, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

: My thought is that Ramakrishna must have been talking about the Dvaita school in this quotation, rather than saying he was a follower of it? The book has an ISBN so it should be possible to obtain a copy and check this. I understand there are both monistic and dualistic schools of Shaivism, and the quotation is refering to the dualistic one's specifically, I will address this now. Thank you for pointing it out.

== Notes to the discussion about reincarnation, the Bible and Christianity ==

By Jan Erik Sigdell (Slovenia). Some facts contributed by the author of the book in German: ''Reinkarnation, Christentum und das kirchliche Dogma'' – "Reincarnation, Christianity and the Dogma of the Church" (Ibera, Vienna, 2001).
 
'''To die once, Hebr. 9:27'''
“And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment”, hence: die once – live once – no reincarnation. The Greek word here translated as “once” is ''hapax''. Greek dictionaries tell us that the word can also mean: “once and for all”, “at once, suddenly”, “one day, eventually”. Hence, the contradiction to reincarnation is only apparent and related to a tendentious and subjectively chosen translation that fits the purpose.
 
'''John and Elias, Matth. 11:14, 17:10-13'''
John the Baptist is Elias (in earlier texts: Elijah). As a contradiction to this literal understanding, John 1:21 is referred to, where John the Baptist denies being Elias. His words are chosen to contradict what Jesus said! Should we believe him more than Jesus? The Christian view must be, that Jesus knew what John didn’t know. Very few consciously know their past personality and it may very well be that John wasn’t one of them. Or he may have avoided the question, telling only half the truth: “I am not Elias (now, but I once was)”. In any case, the mere fact that people asked him about this demonstrates that they took Jesus’ words literally.
John the Baptist was killed. Could this have been his karma? Read 2 Kings 18:40: “And Elias said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elias brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there” [some 400 persons…]. So Elias had murdered...

'''The man born blind, John 9:2'''
A disciple asked Jesus about the possibility that the man was born blind because of what he did before he was born (one of the two alternatives in his question). This shows that the disciple believed in preexistence. Jesus doesn’t correct him in that, but instead indicates that in this individual case the blindness had nothing to do with having sinned before being born. A general conclusion cannot be drawn.
Medieval theology has suggested, referring to rabbinical sources, that the man could have sinned in the mother’s womb (having had “evil thoughts” there), a suggestion too absurd to take seriously.

'''Two crucified malefactors, Luke 23:39-43'''
One of them regretted and believed in Jesus, and Jesus said to him: “To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.” He will have had his last incarnation. The other malefactor didn’t regret but mocked Jesus. He will still have had many reincarnations to come…
This, furthermore, contradicts the dogma of inseparability of soul and body. If they were inseparable, his soul couldn’t go to paradise with Jesus the same day.

'''Discussion with Nicodemus, John 3-4 and 8'''
Jesus said: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God”. Nicodemus asked: “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?” He didn’t see that it would have to be a new mother. This quotation of Jesus is in modern text versions usually translated: “Except a man be born from above…”, and it is explained that Nicodemus would have misunderstood Jesus as saying “…be born again…” This explanation refers to the double sense of the Greek word ''anothen'', which can mean both (and a few more things, too). But this is clearly nonsense, because they didn’t speak Greek! They spoke Aramaic! The Aramaic language has no double-sense word that fits here, but a single-sense word ''mille’ela'' = “from above” and another single-sense word ''tanyanut'' = “again, anew”. Clearly, Jesus used the latter, since that is how Nocodemus understood it and a misunderstanding is ruled out in the original language.
Later, Jesus says: “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.” This seems to make no sense. Here, the word ''pneuma'' occurs twice in the Greek text, and has first been translated as “wind” and later as “Spirit”. Pneuma means “wind” and in an indirect sense “spirit” – but also “soul”, that which makes the body alive, the “breath of life” (cf. Hebrew ''ruah''). The latter meaning is common in religious texts. Furthermore, “sound” is here a translation of the Greek ''phoné'', which rather means “voice”. Hence an alternative and correct translation is: “The soul goes where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice [whispering] thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born with a soul.” Now it makes sense. Jesus talks about preexistence: The soul comes from somewhere, where it was before, and goes on to somewhere else when the body dies. Of course, preexistence doesn’t necessarily mean reincarnation – but reincarnation necessarily involves preexistence…
 
'''Whom say people that I am? Luke 9:18-19'''
Jesus said: “’Whom say the people that I am?’ They answering said ‘John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again’.” John the Baptist would obviously not be possible, but the other alternatives indicate that some people in him saw a possible reincarnation of Elias or another old prophet.

'''Origen and reincarnation'''
Origen’s relevant original texts were burnt in the 6th century. The only texts remaining to-day are the Latin translations by Rufinus and Hieronymus, the latter only in fragments. Both admit in the introduction to the translation that they have adjusted the text to fit the Dogma and omitted certain “offensive” parts. Thus, clearly, if Origen had written positively about reincarnation, they will have omitted that or changed its wording.
Through burning the original texts, the Church has withdrawn for itself the grounds for proving its allegation that Origen would have contradicted reincarnation.

'''The anathemata against Origen'''
In the protocols of the Council in Constantinople of 553, the condemnations of Origen were mentioned. They were not a subject discussed in the council itself, but this merely confirmed a condemnation formulated ten years earlier in a local synod in Constantinople. The Council instead dealt with the “three Chapters”, three texts by long dead bishops, now condemned as heretical. But before the Council was opened, waiting for the pope to appear, emperor Justinian presented the text from 543 and requested the bishops present to sign it. The pope didn’t come and the Council, therefore, wasn’t opened yet. A week later they gathered again, but the pope didn’t agree and still didn’t come. The emperor, therefore, declared the Council opened without the presence of the pope, clearly against the rules for a Council.
Emperor Justinian wrote in his edict against Origen, in which he ordered the condemnation at the synod of 543, that, according to Origen: “spiritual entities were fallen in sin and as punishment banned into bodies… becoming imprisoned in a body a second and a third time or even still more times…”
The first anathema reads: “If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema.” The Greek words here translated as “monstrous restoration” are ''teratodi apokatastasin''. ''Apokatastasis'' normally refers to the restoration of God’s creation in its original holy order, which is certainly not monstrous… hence it will here refer to something else, but to what? Does it refer to the restoration of a new body for the soul? This would truly be “monstrous” to the Dogma… This may be a reference to reincarnation, without mentioning it by name. And if so, it confirms that Origen was viewed as advocating reincarnation.
Since the condemnation of Origen isn’t a decision by an allegedly “infallible” Council, it has never been officially forbidden to the Christian to believe in preexistence, nor in reincarnation…
 
'''The Council in Nicaea in 325'''
It has been repeatedly alleged that belief in reincarnation was condemned during the Council in Nicaea in 325. No reference to that is found in protocols of the Council. However, it is known that these protocols are incomplete. Parts of them are missing. It is also known that emperor Constantine didn’t allow the Gnostic Christians to speak at the Council and that he gave their propositions and petitions to the fire without opening them. It is historically documented that most of the Gnostic Christians believed in reincarnation, but he didn’t give them the chance to present their views.

'''The third and fourth generation? Num. 14:18'''
“The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.” If this were so, it would be a horrible injustice to punish innocent children, grandchildren and so on for what an ancestor did! And what “mercy” would that be? Such an interpretation is contradicted in Deut. 24:16: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.” The Christian Gnostics interpreted the text in Num. 14:18 as referring to the “third and forth incarnation” of a sinner. That would be just…

== Please edit that: ==

== In Occident: a mainly Greek idea, at the dubious origin ==
Pythagore. Although some believe to detect the belief in the reincarnation at the Celtic druids or other group pagan, it is mainly in the Greek world that the doctrines of the métempsycose flower. In Greek, métempsycose means "transmigration of the hearts". In these doctrines, the heart continues its evolution of existence in existence, and can be possibly incarnated in an animal or a plant. It is towards the Life front century. J.-C. which this belief appears in the Greek world. Its origin is not known with certainty. One does not find of it trace at Homère or Hésiode, it is thus not very probable that it comes from the Greek mythical past. For the Greek historian Hérodote, the belief in the métempsycose would be of origin égyptienne{{ref|1}}. It is also possible that it was inpirée by the Indian hindouism. The contacts between Greece and India however were complicated a long time by the fact that Perse, enemy hereditary of the Greeks, was between two civilizations (it is mainly with the conquests of Alexandre the Large one that the Greek world and the Indian world were in constant contact). Among Greeks, the orphism and the pythagorism will constitute the stones of sitted of the doctrines of the métempsycose. It will influence then poets like Pindare and of the philosophers like Plato. One finds discussions direct of the reincarnation or allusions to this one in Phédon, Ménon, the Banquet, and particularly in the er myth. In the Greek thought, the reincarnation is primarily regarded as a process of purification allowing the rise to be it matter towards the divine one (towards the Platonic Ideas, in particular).

*1{{ref|1}} "They are still the Egyptians who, the first, said that the human heart is immortal and that at the moment when the body perishes, it comes to be placed in another alive being which is born then; that, when it lived in turn all the terrestrial species, watery and air, then it penetrates again in the body of one man at the moment when he is born, after a three thousand years migration." - Hérodote, Investigation, II, 123.

"Some researchers, such as Professor Ian Stevenson, have explored the issue of reincarnation and published evidence of children's memories of earlier lives. Skeptics are critical of this work and say that more reincarnation research is needed."

While this sentence is balanced, it does not reflect the article. That is what the introduction is supposed to do. The article conveys the situation fairly, and the situation is that there is convincing research proving that there is something to the idea, and no one has a convincing way to refute these ideas.

== Sufism and Reincarnation ==

I am curious about the author's interpretation of Sufi notions on death. He/she refers to a book title as evidence of some Sufis believing in reincarnation: "Bawa Muhaiyadeen (see his To Die Before Death: The Sufi Way of Life)." This is probably a misinterpretation of a fundamental tenet of Sufism and Islam in general. When Sufis say "die before you die" they mean the death of the ego. Sufism is about complete surrender to the will of Allah. All preconceptions, desires, and connections to this world are released and total submission is made to God. This is the primary goal of any Sufi. It has nothing to do with reincarnation. That is not to say that some Sufis do not believe in some form of reincarnation, but that would be something of an anomaly and still has nothing to do with "Die before death" or die before dying as some Sufis put it.

== Eastern and Western: Weird organization ==

It's odd that Native American beliefs are included under the umbrella of "Western", considering their ideas developed in complete isolation from the European traditions we associate as being the core of "Western Civilization". In that sense, in Pre-Columbian times Native American cultures had even less connection to European cultures than Far Eastern societies did. Islam and Zoroastrianism aren't particularly "Western" or "Eastern", either. --[[Special:Contributions/76.98.148.217|76.98.148.217]] ([[User talk:76.98.148.217|talk]]) 07:54, 25 October 2009 (UTC)

Agree about Native American - it belongs in a class of its own. However, Islam is considered a Western religion because,
a) it arose in the West (Middle East, the same place Judaism and Christianity are from
b) because Western Civilization/philosophy/thought, was greatly developed and influenced by Islamic Arabs between the 700s and 1400s, and heavy undertones derived from Islam as a religion are representative in these. Notions that developed from a religious interpretation of Islam lead to ideas such as secularism, scepticism, and empiricism (the scientific method).

But Islam also strongly influenced east philosophies.

At any rate, Near Eastern philosophies (Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism) are Western philosophies, while anything East of Persia (India and beyond) is Eastern. [[Special:Contributions/94.4.150.110|94.4.150.110]] ([[User talk:94.4.150.110|talk]]) 00:48, 27 December 2009 (UTC)

== Energy and reincarnation ==

I have a thought about reincarnation that might be relevant to this article. In any case, perhaps this would be of interest to a person who's curious about the possibility of reincarnation.

[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] proved with his famous [[E=mc2|equation]] that everything in the universe is energy. Consequently, it's a scientific fact that upon death every human being will transform into some other expression of energy. Of course, this doesn't validate any notion of a soul moving from one body to another. But doesn't it prove that there is undoubtedly a perpetuated existence of all living beings? Nothing is added or taken away from the universe. Perhaps someone with more knowledge about physics could extrapolate on this.

== Reincarnation in non vedic cultures ==

The theory of attributing reincarnation to the "aboriginal" non vedic culture is entirely speculative. The earliest written evidence containing precise definitions of karma and moksha can be found in Brihadaranyaka by Yagnavalkya. The idea of rebirth can be traced to Rigveda (egs in mandala eleven, there is a description of how a persion is repeatedly put into a mother's womb). The idea might have evolved (probably independently) in the Shramanic culture (having its roots in the non orthodox Sankhya school). One of the references that was referred, suggests that Yagnavalkya was reluctant to teach the concepts of reincarnation to Janaka, and based on this, concludes that reincarnation was previously unknown. In Brihadaranyaka, Janaka is eager to learn the concept of Brahman (not reincarnation) and Yagnavalkya tests the eagerness of his possible student. In the upanishads, lot of such stories have been told (egs: there is a story about a son who tries to learn the concept of Brahman from his father). What should be noted is that the concept of reincarnation was primarily born from the experiences of the seers ( both vedic and non-orthodox ).  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/220.227.207.12|220.227.207.12]] ([[User talk:220.227.207.12|talk]]) 06:21, 8 February 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Suggestions ==

There should be mention of reincarnation research here. It is clearly germane to the subject of the article. And if there's coverage of it, it should be mentioned in the lead per [[WP:LEAD]].

Besides, Stevenson's work has made it into secondary sources that discuss reincarnation aside from reincarnation research. See below.

Now I am alright with removing the Tucker quote because it seems to be original synthesis. I will tag the thing it is being used to rebut at the moment. The rest of the material is good.

And please note that including the reactions of skeptics but not of supporters is POV. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 08:19, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

The current version has four objections/criticisms and one response. The Sagan quote is neither. It gives a nearly neutral presentation of the responses (though doesn't actually describe the research).

It should mention the positive reviews in the journals, which are the most important reactions. If others insist on adding more skeptical material, I will also insist on adding this important material. However I am willing to accept the current version which is somewhat balanced, though as I noted tilted toward the negative side. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 08:26, 27 March 2010 (UTC)

== Sources on reincarnation that include coverage of Stevenson's research ==

Books I happen to have read personally: B. Alan Wallace ''Contemplative science'' by Columbia University Press 2007, p. 13, and Peter Harvey ed., ''An introduction to Buddhist ethics'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, page 419, and [http://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&pg=RA3-PA368&dq=reincarnate+%22ian+stevenson%22&lr=&cd=57#v=onepage&q=stevenson&f=false] (this one is a key academic text studying the development of the concept and related ones that is cited by other major works I could cite, and covers Stevenson's research extensively).

These are other academic texts:

And ''Contributions to Asian Studies: 1974, Volume 5'' by Brill Academic Publishers includes an article by Stevenson and co-authors: [http://books.google.com/books?id=OREVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA36&dq=%22ian+stevenson%22&lr=&cd=12#v=onepage&q=%22ian%20stevenson%22&f=false].

The fact that it received some (in some cases extensive) coverage in medical journals shows that it is also suggestive and interesting. But I understand that this will not be accepted in certain quarters. I think "multivocal" is better. In fact if you look at the etymology I think it must be acceptable to everyone. The section covers Stevenson so he should also be mentioned, and he is always held up as the dominant figure in this area generally by the sources above.

== Unreliable source for mainstream respect ==

 
In the section on parapsychological research the following clause is present:

{{cquote|Though his work did garner some academic respect}}

This is referenced to a work by [[Jim B. Tucker]]. Obviously this does not qualify as a mainstream source, <s>nor does it support the statement, ''per se''</s>. Unless an independent source can be found for this clause, it should be removed.

[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] ([[User talk:ScienceApologist|talk]]) 14:10, 31 March 2010 (UTC)

:The use of the word "mainstream" struck me as original research. That word itself would need a source to back it up. But Tucker, as a university faculty member, is by definition an [[academic]]. He may not be mainstream, but since the article already states that the scientific community at large disagrees with him, the article would not seem to be implying that his research is any more accepted than it is. Whether Tucker is a reliable source about reincarnation is, I think, beside the point; he would seem to be a reliable source for a mundane assertion that support for Stevenson has popped up somewhere in academia.

(I say "prominent" because he does hold a high-level position at his university, and because he's rather well-known in general; I don't mean to imply "mainstream" or anything to that effect.

:::::::::A nitpick: when journals publish research that later turns out to be irrelevant or a sideshow curiosity as this research currently is, we do not expect there to be any rejoinders or papers discrediting the research in the journals. Such papers are only published when other researchers decide to support the research. This never happened with Stevenson. In such cases where research garners no interest in the relevant community, journals generally reject ''all'' papers relating to the subject whether they are positive or negative because there is limited space to publish papers and there are editorial reasons to let sleeping dogs lie. This is essentially the case right now with nearly all parapsychology research. There was a brief flurry of interest in the 1960s and 1970s in some of these subjects, but it's now more than 30 years on and no self-respecting journal would touch this drivel with a 10-foot-pole. Now, I'm not saying that it isn't notable that there was this period of "let's hear what they have to say" in the history of academic science, but that period of time is over. Because of this situation, pretending that we can only accept journal articles as a refutation of the claims of reincarnation is simply not going to fly. The older the journal article is without receiving support or literature citations, the less likely it is still relevant to contemporary understanding. In short, Stevenson is discredited precisely because he is ignored. [[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] ([[User talk:ScienceApologist|talk]]) 14:31, 1 April 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::[edit conflict] While I admit that ScienceApologist raised some valid issues with regard (ultimately) to phrasing, I'm rather baffled by the effort to exclude Tucker entirely. From what the [[Jim B. Tucker]] article says, it looks like Tucker is a respected (and well-known) faculty member at a mainstream university. His eccentric research interests do not make him less credible as a scientist; in fact, his article even calls him a skeptic. Compared to the likes of [[Isaac Newton's religious views|Isaac Newton]] and [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/03/collins.commentary/index.html the guy] who led the [[Human Genome Project]], this makes Tucker sound like [[Richard Dawkins]]. But I digress. The overall theme of the section in question is that Stevenson conducted research on reincarnation. The view of the scientific community, while noteworthy, is not the ''main idea'' of the passage. The main idea is Stevenson, and it follows (as a basic rule of good writing) that the contents of the passage should be weighted ''relative to the main idea, i.e., to Stevenson''. Regardless of what views the scientific community has (and, really, regardless of what Tucker thinks), it is notable ''that'' Stevenson and Tucker were collaborators. Tucker is a [[WP:N|notable]] individual who prominently collaborated with Stevenson. While it might be inappropriate to frame Tucker's views so that they look like ''the'' authoritative views on reincarnation, it is, IMHO, perfectly reasonable to place Tucker in the Stevenson paragraph, framing his views as complements (or counterpoints) to Stevenson's own conclusions. [[User:Cosmic Latte|Cosmic Latte]] ([[User talk:Cosmic Latte|talk]]) 21:19, 31 March 2010 (UTC)
::::::::::That argument, that the "main idea" of the section is Stevenson and should be weighted towards that, is akin to saying the [[WP:PROMOTE|ad shouldn't get off message]]. Already this section is too Stevenson heavy. Weren't there some past-life regressioner research too? [[Raymond Moody]] did reincarnation research.

:::::::::::For the most part, I actually agree with you. My position is that, ''if'' Stevenson is to remain the section's main idea, then Tucker probably deserves some mention.

[[User:Cosmic Latte|Cosmic Latte]] ([[User talk:Cosmic Latte|talk]]) 01:53, 1 April 2010 (UTC)

Stevenson is the main idea, though his line of research is being carried on by others now. Stevenson's ''methodology and rigor'' have been praised in medical journals. This is the mainstream respect. ScienceApologist and LuckyLouie both know about this fact. It seems that this is being removed on a pretext. If we are going to mention reactions to his research at all (and my complete rewrite did not), we must include this, which is ''the most'' important reaction. If he had been doing past-life regression, he wouldn't have gotten the coverage he has. The other reactions to his work, and discussion of his conclusions, have been in non-scientific fora.

I have added in some content sourced to two different medical journals. One is his obituary in the British Medical Journal, which entitled his obituary "Ian Pretyman Stevenson, psychiatrist who researched reincarnation with scientific rigour". I hope that this new addition will meet everyone's standards on every front. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 06:34, 1 April 2010 (UTC)

:Stevenson ''shouldn't'' be the "main idea" of a section about "research" is the point. And it's not all about mainstream respect either. Otherwise you wouldn't have Scientology, Eckankar, and others in this article. It's about ''notability'', including notable research follies like past life regression.

== Lead ==

I have taken out mention of parapsychology research from the lead twice now in a week. Others have taken it out as well. Only one editor keeps putting it back in.

Here, I submit that parapsychology research does not deserve mention in the lead of this article, or, at the very most, deserves very minor mention.

Let's decide exactly how to write the lead. My opinion is that the three major sections of the article should have representation in the lead, but Eastern religions and traditions should be weighted most heavily followed by  Western religions and traditions followed last by Contemporary perspectives. I submit that parapsychology amounts to 10% of the section on contemporary perspectives. Giving rough percentages, I think we should be able to agree on a 45% for Eastern religions/traditions, 35% for Western religions/traditions and 20% for Contemporary perspectives. In this case, parapsychology should be 2% of the lead following the definitional sentence. This roughly corresponds to about 3 to 4 words in our lead. I submit that this is the maximum appropriate weight. However, note that [[WP:WEIGHT]] admits that often such minor opinions deserve outright exclusion. I think we're on the threshhold of that here. Reincarnation research is a minority field ''even within parapsychology''. It's so marginalized (rightly or wrongly so) that there does not appear to be more than 4 people seriously working on it today. Comparing this to the billions of people who actually believe in the subject makes me more convinced that the sentence that Mitsube was trying to include was indeed overly weighted.

Cheers,

:The secondary source coverage is a better guide than your strange statistical arguments. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 19:53, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

To address your point which is not policies, namely, there aren't many people working on this, that is true. But of course, not relevant. There are many reasons why that might be so, but the few that have researched it have gotten significant secondary source coverage, in academic treatments of reincarnation, as I proved above. Why is there not more interest? Entrenched dogma against reincarnation, is one. Similarly unsubstantiated dogma kept homosexuality labeled a disorder for a long time.

Yet, given the secondary source coverage, this research is clearly interesting. And it is well-funded. But really what is there to add? It is a proven fact that thousands of children have reported past life-stories. The journals who published Stevenson's research point out that there aren't really any normal explanations for these phenomena. These reports were scrupulously documented, in all areas of the world. So what else is there to do? You can draw conclusions or not. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 20:06, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== Rebirth (Buddhism) ==

I think the distinction between reincarnation and the Buddhist concept of rebirth could be further explained.  Reincarnation implies taking human form, whereas rebirth does not, reflecting the Buddhist belief in other realms within the cycle of rebirth - those of the gods, demigods, hungry ghosts, hell beings and animals.  Only the last of these has any tangible connection with the human realm but all are possible rebirths. 

RE: "Tibetan Buddhists also believe that a newborn child may be the rebirth of some important departed."
I have objections to this statement.  Most importantly, it fails to distinguish between rebirth, which happens to beings in accordance with their karma, and incarnation (not reincarnation) which a realized individual chooses to do (out of compassion for other beings' suffering).  
The statement would be much better expressed (IMHO) something like: *Tibetan Buddhists believe that an accomplished or realized practitioner (by maintaining conscious awareness during the death process) can choose to return to samsara and exist within, but no longer uncontrollably bound to, the cycle of rebirth.  In this way, many lamas choose to be born again and again as humans, and are called tulkus or incarnate lamas. "  
The one recognised does not have to be a newborn.  Usually the mother/parents will have signs before the birth indicating the child may be a tulku, but the individual may not be formally recognized as a tulku until for years - sometimes not until adulthood.

::SA: I agree that the section needs to be modified. You will observe that I have brought in several religious articles and trimmed them down a bit. Nevertheless the religious sections are extensive and fragmented according to belief. Therefore a general and contextual section must precede them, and the surest basis for this is general academic study of the subject in and of itself. As a religious belief it is not "fringe" in the west - it probably compares with the number of thorough materialists - while in India, which English wiki serves, it may be a majority view. This overall view has primacy, establishing the notability of the subject, views and general features.

::Studies such as those of Stevenson and philosophical arguments are therefore useful. I have not added to these - I'd cut the latter example down - but have simply gathered them for such a general presentation. They have been present for some time and I therefore consider your present edits unhelpful particularly since they are motivated by the extreme point of view that has been frequently blocked. In fact, I have been prevented from improving this section because an edit war on [[Reincarnation research]] has led to full locking. There's a further presentation of Stevenson's work under his own page, too lengthy to be detached from the page that cannot be edited. I find all this spreading unacceptable since it leads to confused, forked presentation. Several other pages, dealing with things like past-life recall, should be mentioned here or even merged in. To allow all this inward merging I moved all the "popular culture" material out, so the page is now around 9k smaller than when I began to edit. 

::Stevenson's studies are, as Clarke says, "hard to explain" because they involve apparently well-documented [[cryptomnesia]]. Fundamentally these take place in the realm of subjectivity and anecdote, but they are well-documented and hard to explain. These papers do not present a detailed "scientific" argument about the consequent nature of mind, let alone the "physical mind" to which some of these articles refer. They raise the question of memory - whether it can have some existence outside a brain. Of course scientists use the term to describe behaviour of materials, but not time and space I think. Apart from a few like Sheldrake, since the successes of molecular biology, the idea has been "fringe", certainly. But the place to mention it will be beside the other researchers and philosophers and this is clearly the only non-sectarian, general treatment and therefoe has precedence. Really, even an ancient Indian like [[Patanjali]] has to be considered also. Your thoughts on this section and on page mergers and splits are welcome of course, particularly if you will help bring about the unlocking of the mentioned page.

::::Redheylin, the best academic studies of reincarnation are not from Stevenson et al. They come from comparative religion departments which treat religious beliefs and dogma to be something other than empirical phenomena. That's important since the vast majority of the people who believe in reincarnation do NOT interact with it under any assumption that it is a scientific subject. I'm fine with a contextual section, but you must base in on comparative religious academics: not on New Age reincarnation theosophist researchers at dying parapsychology programs. Sheldrake, Stevenson, and the other woo-woo fringe academics belong at the END of the article with a rigorous mainstream treatment of the subject following literature, philosophy, and religious studies. As Nealparr pointed out, it's ridiculous that Plato isn't in our lead but we are insisting on including Stevenson's much ignored research.

{{od}}Please, no one but no one in academia takes this reincarnation research business seriously. It's a joke. Sure, Stevenson's methodology was laudable, but his work has been debunked subsequently by numerous skeptical outlets with little in the way of rebuttal. And parapsychology, as an academic discipline, has been steadily declining at mainstream research institutions since the 1970s as they seem to have essentially a bunch of misinterpretations, null results, and in some cases outright fraud to show for themselves. This is neither here-nor-there because we have a full panoply of relevant academics who discuss reincarnation from the perspective of comparative religion. That's the correct focus for this article and parapsychology fantasies need to be relegated to the fringe position that they currently enjoy in academia by virtue of their simple minority statuses. Just because someone is a full professor doesn't mean they can't be on the fringe. Our guideline you yourself reference is pretty clear on that point.

:The article is [[Reincarnation]]. The subject can be, and has been, approached from an anthropological/comparative religion view, from that of folklore and popular culture, historically, by means of psychological methods/studies and also in the dimension of philosophical speculation, including that based on materialist conceptions of the mind-body problem. Outside psychology there has been little actual scientific study since there is no quantifiable physical paradigm to test. However, it is not possible entirely to separate study of the religious aspect of the phenomenon from the philosophical and empirical, since Pythagoras, Plato, Patanjali and Gautam Buddha all claim rational and empirical bases for a theory whose origins cannot be determined. The origins of popular modern western belief also cannot properly be determined either, but overall the subject is not "fringe", nor is it generally derived from simple childhood faith - Stevenson's work is a noteable product of this modern religious phenomenon that well delineates some possible reasons for its attraction. Obviously the reasons other people do not accept it are equally important.

:Although some of these separate viewpoints currently have separate pages, this highlights the importance of such views to the overall subject and these standpoints, linked, must therefore be prominently displayed and briefly explained. You state that articles based on religious studies are "better" than any others, but this means no more to me than contending that a picture of Donald Duck is "better" than a screwdriver. Your personal preferences should not interfere with the addition of a neutral and comprehensive introductory section. 

:Since any article must proceed from the general to the special, such an overall view of the subject must precede the treatment of various religions separately. For chronological reasons any extended account of modern thinking may come after the religions, but in this case it is not intended to treat Stevenson, for instance, or this natural philosopher with anything more than brevity unless the page [[Reincarnation research]] is to be merged here. 

:You write: "Sure, Stevenson's methodology was laudable, but his work has been debunked subsequently by numerous skeptical outlets with little in the way of rebuttal." I'd be grateful if you'd supply the best of such rebuttals for inclusion. I'd ask you carefully to differentiate between work showing flaws in method, that suggesting alternative explanations and that raising questions in another arena of thought, such as assertion of brain-memory identity. Please supply brief sentences and verifiable links for each.

:You have complained about the lack of material on Plato - I have added a section. I have considerably extended the Greek and other comparative religious sections already. You write; ''"Major scholars of Eastern religions do not have their work referenced here, neither do the relevant anthropologists, philosophers, and literary critics who have commented on this subject. This is a travesty."'' But again, I have been adding such material, whereas you yourself have added nothing. This is a travesty of an argument.

:I would simply like to enquire if any editor supports or objects to the construction of such an introductory section as I have proposed, the basis of which has twice been destroyed by Science Apologist. As I understand it, his proposal leads to the result that this page must be renamed [[Reincarnation in religion, anthropology, philosophy and literature but excluding any modern westerners who thinks there may be anything in it]] - If SA would like to second the proposal, or suggest a snappier title?

::The issue I have is not with your additions but with your spin (which is currently out of the article in a way that is satisfying to me). You seem to have a goal of presenting reincarnation as something which has scientific basis: and this is a misleading direction for the article. Parapsychology is a marginalized and [[WP:FRINGE|fringe]] subject. We can have ''brief'' mention here, but making it the first section or prominent in the lead or related to some sort of overarching claim about "natural philosophy" is ridiculous. The section that Johnfos restored at least dealt with the subject in a balanced way since I worked on it with Mitsube (and this, by the way, is the answer to your insistence that I haven't added anything) even though it is probably a bit long-in-the-tooth about Stevenson. The point is, lensing this article through reincarnation research is inappropriate because the subject isn't as [[WP:PROMINENCE|prominent]] as comparative religion treatments. I am under no obligation to do anything but marginalize the overly-weighted sections. In other words, I am under no obligation to add, add, add.

:::Your contention that I am "presenting reincarnation as something which has scientific basis" is absurd, first because I have worked only on religions and popular culture, second because, despite several requests, you are unable to clarify what you mean by "scientific basis" - the only studies I know of are in the realm of psychology - by researchers who only become "para"-psychologists by dint of the fact that they research the topic. There are a few discussions in terms of philosophy of mind - these began with Patanjali and Pythagoras - and there is comparative religion. Your own revelation, that there is no "physics of mind" is indeed a profound and significant insight that deserves to be shared with the world, and, handily, notables like Arthur C Clarke and Carl Sagan have offered comments on this in respect to Stevenson's work - a fact that demonstrates the prominence of his work.

:::The only comparative religion at present is the western survey and a very unbalanced and inadequate part of the lede. I have inserted quick notes on Greece, Ismaelis and gulat, Manichees and Druids and merged Buddhism and Kabala and, together with modern developments, the lede is inadequate. "Comparative religion" cannot be entirely distributed between the separate religions, neither can it be entirely divided from philosophy and empirical research, neither can the modern era entirely be separated from ancient times, nor east from west. This is why I chose to migrate upwards all material that did not relate to specific religions. It is not proposed to give a full account of any matter, but to provide linked sentences approximating to the first line of the lede of the linked page.

Stevenson's stuff was praised in its time, but it is pretty much ignored today. Pretending that it is ''au courant'' or indicative of empirical basis for reincarnation beliefs is the problem. Mentioning it as an historical oddity is fine. The faint praise of a late astronomer-skeptic and the oblique excitement of a late science fiction pedophile does not, in my mind, make Stevenson's work particularly more noteworthy than the relatively modern treatments found in [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=69035 Tony Walter's work], [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=blXxk8-RXHAC Paul Yevtic's work], or [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=KX0yl4j_nvQC& Peter Bishop's work].

== Reincarnation and rebirth ==

Mitsube: the Buddhist content on this page very strongly pushes the doctrine of no-self and a consequent supposedly univeral adoption of the term "rebirth" in contradistinction to "reincarnation" in English Buddhist studies. While I understand that the distinction of doctrine is important and the useful terminology is advocated by some, I also find by Googling that usage of the term "rebirth" is not more universal than usage of "reincarnation", "transmigration" etc. in Buddhist context.

Further, I find that pages on the related concepts of samsara and karma, which are separated according to religious doctrines, offer views that, to the general reader, would appear contradictory. For example, [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)]] quotes the Dhammapada;

''"the tears you have shed while transmigrating & wandering this long, long time — crying & weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing"''

It seems to me that a Mahayana/Theravada POV fork is possible: there's no accessible bridge between these two statements for the general reader, who is not informed of different schools nor of how this apparent self-contradiction of Buddha can be resolved. You have supported the "reincarnation" of the page [[Rebirth (Buddhism)]] but it seems to me these pages only perpetuate such forks, making Wikipedia a manual of dogma without historical and comparative religious context, in which much repetition and duplication only hides the logic and sequence of philosophic differences from the reader while providing a playground for quarrelsome editors on a thousand fronts. The above page carries no information not also present on this page, but it avoids comparative/historical/philosophical analysis there, lacks structure and even forks with other Buddhist content. It just exists for POV-pushing. "Anatta" is important here to allow a special Buddhist page, but on the Samsara page it is nowhere to be found, just souls wandering miserably forever. There the Noble Truths are the excuse to have another page from the poor, bog-standard, ordinary Samsara page that is only good for Hindus.

I have mentioned a few other such latent forks I have recently found in the treatment of this subject, for example the account of Indo-European versus non-IE origins, the presentation of Stevenson' work, of the Greeks. I'd ask you to offer your skills in the improvement of this dismal record, to refrain from supporting the inclusion of duplicate material elsewhere and instead to seek systematic, accessible and neutral presentation of key concepts shared among Indian religions. [[User:Redheylin|Redheylin]] ([[User talk:Redheylin|talk]]) 17:57, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

:Redheylin, first of all I think you have done good work on this page. Now I have two points. First, can you provide extracts on the proposed proto-Indo-European reincarnation idea? Excluding a possible new translation of one sentence in the Rig Veda, there is no evidence of reincarnation in the earliest Vedic texts. So what do the sources say?
:Now about reincarnation vs. rebirth, the material in the intro is reliably sourced. You can look at the link.
:Now about anatta, that is a pan-Buddhist doctrine. Mahayanists believe in it as well. Even in one sutra which seems to teach Self, it says that the "Self" it teaches is really not-Self. If you want to get nitty-gritty, the Buddha never said that there is no self, but he did say that no self could be perceived, and all doctrines of self lead to suffering.
:About the samsara page, this is where the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)#Buddhism|stream of consciousness]] idea comes in. The past life is not entirely different, so it is permissible to say "you suffered then". But it's not entirely the same so you cannot say "you are the same person". It is just the same as changing from one day to the next. You are not the same person you were yesterday, but in another sense you are. If this article doesn't explain this clearly I should work on it. It is explained pretty well [[Anatta#Anatta and moral responsibility|here]].

::Mitsube, thank you but you have misunderstood. I have not doubted that "reincarnation vs. rebirth...is reliably sourced" but said that greatly undue weight is put upon this source, even to the extent of the very structuring of articles, and that this has resulted in forking, internal contradiction, duplication and redundancy and prevented historicism and clear comparisons. I see no value in this given that the majority of Buddhist scholarship in English does not appear to observe the distinction of terms here proposed as fundamental. Further, I had not personally requested an explanation of doctrine or links - I had pointed out that the reader of the articles lacks such apparatus. Here I must add that the linked section itself would need to be examined for independence of source before being explained or linked elsewhere. Next, as things currently stand, I believe you'll need to paste your work into at least four pages; this, the reincarnated Buddhist page, the general Samsara page and the Buddhist samsara page.

:::::::::Missed this - better not to break posts up then I suppose. In my view, already stated, historical and philosophical differences can only be presented in historical and philosophical terms. Philosophically and historically Buddhism forms a continuum with Hinduism, so that many statements of criticism of the one standpoint are also defences of the other. Wiki is not a dictionary or a "how-to" manual and should be topic-driven, not belief-driven. This applies to a wide range of pages. The present page merely shows that all the information currently available on reincarnation in Buddhism fits on the general page but is currently spread over several pages that contradict each other as it is only to be expected they would. The present interest seems merely in getting as many Buddhist pages as possible for I see no move towards actually fixing the incoherent view wiki offers, and is being forced to continue to offer. Wherever I find edit war I find fundamental imbalances and inconsistencies of presentation that invite it. [[User:Redheylin|Redheylin]] ([[User talk:Redheylin|talk]]) 00:28, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

I'm not sure what you mean by "Philosophically and historically Buddhism forms a continuum with Hinduism". I don't think you could find reliable sources making that statement. And I don't know what you're asking for, for the articles on the Buddhist theories of rebirth and samsara to be deleted by redirecting the names somewhere else? That seems like a pretty bizarre idea to me. These articles should be expanded not deleted. And the current reincarnation article is already too long. If there are contradictions between the articles then they should be cleaned up, not deleted. [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 06:08, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:"I don't think you could find reliable sources making that statement" - first page I tried: Flood, p 17; "These Sramana traditions, including Buddhism and Jainism, developed during the first millennium BCE and were in conflict with brahminical, vedic orthopraxy". In fact it could not be otherwise - it can not be a coincidence that all use the same terms such as ''karma, samsara''.

: "the articles on the Buddhist theories of rebirth and samsara to be deleted by redirecting the names somewhere else? That seems like a pretty bizarre idea to me. These articles should be expanded not deleted." The articles are expanded by bringing them into closer contact with others on the same subject. Nothing was deleted; the entire contact of the "buddhism" page is included here already, but it gains clarity and substance through a historical presentation, comparison and distinction.

:"And the current reincarnation article is already too long." It's as long as it ought to be. If it should be split it would not necessarily be best to split it into separate sects. Material that I have pulled out of there now forms half the article, so if that general treatment, made up of related information that was previously spread through separate sects, were to be detached, for instance, all the sects could still remain together - "reincarnation in religion" as distinct from in popular culture and science. But the matter is a general one: it applies to many pages, particularly in religion where, as I say, people wish to present doctrine as a timeless truth hermetically different from all other knowledge by virtue of its self-evident rightness - and then fight with critics who clearly know that this is wrong and the other is the only truth.

== Definition/etymology ==

The very first sentence of this article says that reincarnation literally means "to be made flesh again."  This is actually quite a bad gloss, if you ask me.  First and foremost, "to be made" is a verb, and "reincarnation" is a noun--no matter what, the definition needs to be in the form of a noun, not a verb.

Secondly, the definition is in the passive voice, and it shouldn't be.  "To reincarnate" means "to make flesh," not "to be made flesh."  There is a very significant difference.

My proposal would read something like this: "the act of making (s.o./sth.) flesh again."  [[Special:Contributions/71.77.10.216|71.77.10.216]] ([[User talk:71.77.10.216|talk]]) 10:45, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

== Questions for ScienceApologist ==

ScienceApologist, can we remove the labels ("believers in reincarnation", "apologists for reincarnation")? The secondary sources don't present things in this suggestive way. Can we just leave the facts? People who go to the Ian Stevenson article will clearly see that he believed in reincarnation. And putting that in here presents only that side of him, not that the fact that he was a careful, methodical, even obsessive researcher. So instead of describing him in one sentence, let's leave these things out. Also, calling Almeder an apologist for reincarnation is unsupported, and is casting an aspersion. Calling the journals "low-impact factor" is not supported and irrelevant even if true. I accept "pseudoscientific interpretations of this work have been roundly criticized by skeptics" without the "roundly", which is an endorsement. Also why do you need to remove the information about children remembering past lives from the Sagan quote? Regards, [[User:Mitsube|Mitsube]] ([[User talk:Mitsube|talk]]) 23:56, 28 March 2010 (UTC)

:::The current version of the article is largely alright, but the current language at the end of the section completely sidelines what attention the medical community did give Stevenson. For example, the review of ''European Cases of the Reincarnation Type'' in the American Journal of Psychiatry described called the book "an inspiring example of application of a painstaking protocol to sift facts from fancy". There are also numerous positive statements about his work in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. This is a good summation: "Though Stevenson’s efforts did not produce mainstream acceptance of his work, it did garner some respect in mainstream circles. The Journal of the American Medical Association reviewed one of his books in 1975 and stated that “in regard to reincarnation he has painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases... in which the evidence is difficult to explain on any other grounds.”" I'm adding in that bit of information (not the quote from the Journal of the AMA), but as I hope you will both agree, what I added is entirely accurate and doesn't slant the section either way, and gives the "negative" statement the last word, which should appeal to some.

== Parapsychology: Lead and article context ==

Reincarnation research is a bizarre article that probably should be dealt with separately, but essentially three points come out of it:

#Parapsychological research by Stevenson and Tucker
#Past-life regression
#Surveys about belief

The final subject is, I think we can all agree, highly relevant to this page. The first subject is not well-discussed there nor here, so work should be done. The second subject is absent here and arguably doesn't belong there. I'd like some people's thoughts on this.

But primarily, I'd like to discuss how [[WP:PROMINENCE|prominent]] people think Stevenson and Tucker are to this particular subject. I contend that they are actually minor players and should be folded in to some modernist consideration section as a historical oddity since they are so marginalized. Others seem to think they deserve considerable more prominence, but seem to argue that they do because they are accomplished scientists or have uncovered empirical evidence for something. Amazing new discoveries, of course, should be kept out of Wikipedia until verified by independent sources which has manifestly not happened for Tucker and Stevenson's stories.

So I propose to incorporate Stevenson and Tucker into the section on modern Western beliefs about reincarnation. I also propose making the sentence in the lead into something more like a clause to tack on to the mention of New Age and Theosophist beliefs.

Please respond.

Indeed, Stevenson discusses his "discontent with psychoanalytic and other current theories of human personality" as being the driving force behind his work, and refers to a 1977 article he published entitled "The Explanatory Value of the Idea of Reincarnation", for which he had "more than 1,000 requests for reprints from scientists all over the world". In this article Stevenson drew attention to reincarnation as a hypothesis of explanatory value for a wide variety of unsolved problems in psychology and medicine.  So, in summary, Stevenson was a psychiatrist who considered that the concept of [[reincarnation]] might supplement those of heredity and environment in helping [[modern medicine]] to understand aspects of human behavior and development.<ref>Ian Stevenson.

Pretty clear. Those interested in parapsychology, like Stevenson, always find inspiration from such sources even while trying to crowbar a separation in methodology. It's no different from [[creation science|creation scientists]] who use the Bible as their inspiration for going out and discovering Noah's Ark. Pseudoscientific rationalizations are often derived from dogmatic investigations of that sort. I also love the self-aggrandizement.

{{od}}That Stevenson didn't like Freud is part of why he appealed to theosophy since Freud viewed such story-telling as being a realization of the unconscious not unlike psychoses. The way he positions himself as a defender of the faith in the reality of reincarnation is the crux of my claim, and it is directly indicated by what is written in the source. That you don't seem to understand this is only indicative of your continued refusal to understand the basic reason why Stevenson's work is wholly outside the mainstream. Stevenson's attempt to obtain an empirical basis for theosophical concepts could only come after being exposed to and accepting these concepts at face-value. This feature of Stevenson's worldview is also seen in the way he ignored (perhaps unwittingly -- faith as such does impose special blinders) the obvious problems with assuming presuppositions had to be confirmed by the evidence he gathered.

#It is claimed that I removed the information about when the memories occur. This is false. The information is still there. Please read carefully.
#It is claimed that I keep removing the word "scientific", which is sourced to the British Medical Journal. It is true that I usually refer to "methodological rigor" rather than "scientific rigor" this is because the source does not specifically say that Ian Stevenson was functioning as a good scientist. The sources agree his methodology was good, but good science must also come to well-supported conclusions. No one outside of Stevenson and his fellow reincarnation believers thought that his conclusions were scientific. Thus we refer ONLY to his methodology when describing independent praise.
#It is claimed that "similar" is too vague, and so functions only to obfuscate. However, the sources do not indicate that the locations of the birthmarks were anatomically identical: only that they were on similar locations of the two bodies.
#It is claimed that "in some cases" is needed, because that didn't always happen. But this is not verified by any of the cases. He investigated possibilities for alternatives, but it is not for us to judge whether it is possible to find alternative explanations for all the cases or not and he never stated that such was impossible. Thus we should just point out that he investigated alternatives and leave it at that. [[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] ([[User talk:ScienceApologist|talk]]) 09:06, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

##No. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reincarnation&action=historysubmit&diff=361636421&oldid=361632902 You said] that the children he studied were between 3 and 7. You removed the data about when the memories occur, begging the question, why did he choose to study children in that age range? That's bad writing. Why did you do that?
##You removed the phrase "scientific rigor of his methods", which is sourced to the article entitled "Ian Pretyman Stevenson, psychiatrist who researched reincarnation with scientific rigour". So the sentence in this article is sourced, and not only that, it refers specifically to his methods. The source isn't so specific. So, what you wrote above doesn't make any sense at all.
##Let's see what the source says: "Further evidence of invariance is to discover that vastly different cultures appear to share with very similar behavioral and physical manifestations in these phenomena—as in the case of birthmarks symbolizing injuries in the previous personality or the apparent high incidence of violent unexpected death in many of those who are reincarnated ... The intensive study of these children has revealed several provocative  findings, such as the apparent increase in death due to violence in those who reincarnate and the startling correspondence found  between birth marks on the child and similar marks or distinguishing features present on the body of the reincarnated personality during their lifetime, such as wounds, injuries, and other stigmata." I had corresponding earlier. I think you removed it. Hopefully you won't remove it again. Besides, it's "Stevenson believed". So it's not even saying it's true (though it is). I'll put in "in correspondence with" hoping you won't revert that.

#The poorly used phrase in the source "scientific rigor" is referring to Stevenson's methods. Let's be clear about that rather than vague. The source is quite specific. Read it beyond the title.
#similar is used in the source. I like it. Corresponding is a bit weird so I removed it, but if you want to try to work it back in with the word similar, for example, "correspondence found between birth marks on the child and similar marks on the deceased".
#I'm fine with the current wording.

:That "similar" is general, referring to similarities across cultures, i.e. the general trend of birthmark correspondence. A man getting hit by a car in Virginia and an Eskimo getting impaled by a spear, with the corresponding birthmarks on young children, is what the author is talking about. And they are not just in similar places. As an informed expert you must have looked at one of his books where he has photographs and detailed physiological descriptions. In one example I saw, a birthmark looked just like the spread of the shotgun blast that corresponded to the fatal wound of someone who died, in the manner you might expect. "Correspond" is from the source, where it is stated as fact, we are only saying "Stevenson believed" it,
:I am not trying to get the word "scientific" applied to everything Stevenson did. That's why I put in "of his methods". What's wrong with that?

::Well, I totally disagree with how you interpret that statement which uses the word "similar", but it's not that important. I tried to reword it using "corresponding". I have looked at the photographs and descriptions. There is no rigorous correlation attempted nor any null hypothesis tested for these birthmark-correspondences. The plural of anecdote is not data, I remind you.
::What's wrong with calling praise for Stevenson's method "scientific rigor" is that the [[scientific method]] has some steps that Stevenson arguably skipped. Stevenson's scrupulosity in collecting data is laudable, but science is more than collecting data. That's the reason I think it better to simply refer to his methods which is indeed the way the sources praise him. Indeed, even those who praised him argued that more work was needed. An unfinished and unconfirmed work is not "scientifically rigorous" in the normal sense. It's just important to keep the word "scientific" away because there is obvious controversy over whether Stevenson was engaged in a kind of pseudoscience. Best not to spoonfeed the reader that the work was in any way scientific. Let them come to their own conclusions, especially when the sources themselves are skeptical of Stevenson's ultimate conclusions.

A high number of reincarnated personalities report violent death, which the child alludes to. 6) In some cultures the individual who “reincarnates” predicts his or her next incarnation and may appear in a dream to the expectant mother of the child to announce an intention to reincarnate in the baby. 7) After the age of 10 these child subjects usually develop normally.</blockquote>

{{od}}Mitsube -- you are misinterpreting and reinterpreting sources to suit your own agenda rather than accepting the the fringe nature of Stevenson's claims.

First of all, you don't have any sources which establish Stevenson's conclusions as "scientific" objectively. This canard about Stevenson's work being "overwhelmingly well-sourced" as "scientific" is just that, a canard. Since there is obviously a controversy about Stevenson's work and whether it is scientific, we can't just state it outright that it is scientific. We can state that Stevenson's work was praised for its methodology and protocols, but Stevenson simply wasn't doing science according to some. We cannot simply [[WP:SS|summarize]] Stevenson's work as being scientific when there are plenty of sources which dispute that.

Secondly, the AJP article is a book review of Stevenson's work. It is summarizing Stevenson. It is not a recipe for taking Stevenson's word as gospel. Just because it is written in a journal doesn't mean that it somehow has magical powers. Since this is a review of a book written by Stevenson, this is absolutely "according to Stevenson". I don't see how anyone could argue otherwise. I am not "disputing a scientific journal", I'm putting it into its appropriate context. If you disagree, take it to [[WP:RSN]] or [[WP:NPOVN]].

Thirdly, you haven't explained why you are listing all those continents.

===Re:Scientific===

If you keep insisting that we describe Stevenson's work as being praised for its "scientific rigor", I think we'll have to begin the impeachment process with the following source:

[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119242621/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 NYAS report by Paul Kurtz],  Paul Edwards' book ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination'', and Robert Todd Carroll's critique in ''The Skeptics Encyclopedia''.

Even Eugene Brody admitted that Stevenson's work was generally regarded as "unscientific": [[http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1977/09000/Research_in_Reincarnation_and_Editorial.1.aspx].

That's what we have.

[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] ([[User talk:ScienceApologist|talk]]) 15:24, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

A VERY reliable source sourcing the perspective that Stevenson was involved in rank pseudoscience. We can

:Let's be clear. The material I have currently is "praised for the scientific rigor ''of his investigations''." That is sourced to three scientific journals. The "of his investigations" is key here. The statements does not include in its scope any conclusions people may make. Stevenson himself proposed explanations alternate to reincarnation, viz. ESP. Kurtz doesn't dispute the scientific rigor of the investigations, and Edwards and Carroll are self-published skeptics who don't have the same standing as material published in scientific journals, so they can't be used to dispute material found therein.
:About Brody, it seems that you have not read the entire passage carefully enough. I'll reproduce it here. He say: "Publication of papers on these topics may imply editorial endorsement of nonscientific ''philosophies and conclusions'' ... our decision to publish this material ... recognizes the scientific and personal credibility of the authors, the legitimacy of their research methods, and the conformity of their reasoning to the usual canons of rational thought."
:So I am upholding the distinction we have repeatedly made about methods (scientific according to journals) and conclusions (speculative) by including the phrase "of his investigations".

Science is indeed a collective voice in many cases, as represented by the thousands of peer reviewed journal entries published by reputable sources. The point is that you have a lot of respected people that say "no, its simply too ridiculous to even bother considering", and one very isolated doctor that tried to convince them otherwise.

Well, that makes life, the universe and everything scary, Tamalie. But things get scarier the more we do not look at them. Maybe the shadow on your bedroom wall looks like a monster. If you get up and have a closer look, you find it's a shadow, not a monster. But so long as you hide under the bedclothes it goes on being maybe a monster.

== Different Than Metempsychosis ==

This page offers limited information on the ancient Greek development of metempsychosis (a topic of intense academic debate, particularly in regards to its likely Western origins), including details of the semi-legendary Pythagoras, his influence on the thought of two and a half millennia including that touchstone of Western philosophy, Plato. The person who advocated for the integration of the page 'metempsychosis' into this page, while claiming that "all the information from [metempsychosis] is reproduced here" (or something to that effect) is simply lying. That metempsychosis is a key phrase in perhaps the most important novel to date, Joyce's Ulysses, argues for a separate page. The editor repeatedly impaled him(or her)self on [their] own arguments in discussion (see Metempsychosis Talk). If a fuller discussion does not take fruit, I will restore the page Metempsychosis, against the tyranny of a single editor. The editor in question would benefit by soliciting citations or expert review. His or her lack of distinction has been made clear. This is not a question of ideology but basic practices. Unilateral deletion of contributed content is not generally a hallmark of Wikipedia. I hope interested intermediaries will note this.

== NOTES by Jan Erik Sigdell TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT REINCARNATION, THE BIBLE AND CHRISTIANITY ==

Some facts contributed by the author of the book in German: ''Reinkarnation, Christentum und das kirchliche Dogma'' – “Reincarnation, Christianity and the Dogma of the Church” (Ibera, Vienna, 2001).

'''To die once, Hebr. 9:27:''' --
“And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment”, hence: die once – live once – no reincarnation. The Greek word here translated as “once” is hapax. Greek dictionaries tell us that the word can also mean: “once and for all”, “at once, suddenly”, “one day, eventually”. Hence, the contradiction to reincarnation is only apparent and related to a tendentious and subjectively chosen translation that fits the purpose. [Cf. this note.]

'''John and Elias, Matth. 11:14, 17:10-13:''' --
John the Baptist is Elias (in earlier texts: Elijah). As a contradiction to this literal understanding, John 1:21 is referred to, where John the Baptist denies being Elias. His words are chosen to contradict what Jesus said! Should we believe him more than Jesus? The Christian view must be, that Jesus knew what John didn’t know. Very few consciously know their past personality and it may very well be that John wasn’t one of them. Or he may have avoided the question, telling only half the truth: “I am not Elias (now, but I once was)”. In any case, the mere fact that people asked him about this demonstrates that they took Jesus’ words literally.

John the Baptist was killed. Could this have been his karma? Read 2 Kings 18:40: “And Elias said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elias brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there” [some 400 persons…].

'''The man born blind, John 9:2:''' --
A disciple asked Jesus about the possibility that the man was born blind because of what he did before he was born (one of the two alternatives in his question). This shows that the disciple believed in preexistence. Jesus doesn’t correct him in that, but instead indicates that in this individual case the blindness had nothing to do with having sinned before being born. A general conclusion cannot be drawn.

Medieval theology has suggested, referring to rabbinical sources, that the man could have sinned in the mother’s womb (having had “evil thoughts” there), a suggestion too absurd to take seriously.

'''Two crucified malefactors, Luke 23:39-43:''' --
One of them regretted and believed in Jesus, and Jesus said to him: “To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.” He will have had his last incarnation. The other malefactor didn’t regret but mocked Jesus. He will still have had many reincarnations to come…

This, furthermore, contradicts the dogma of inseparability of soul and body. If they were inseparable, his soul couldn’t go to paradise with Jesus the same day.

'''Discussion with Nicodemus, John 3:3-4 and 8:''' --
Jesus said: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God”. Nicodemus asked: “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?” He didn’t see that it would have to be a new mother. This quotation of Jesus is in modern text versions usually translated: “Except a man be born from above…”, and it is explained that Nicodemus would have misunderstood Jesus as saying “…be born again…” This explanation refers to the double sense of the Greek word anothen, which can mean both (and a few more things, too). But this is clearly nonsense, because they didn’t speak Greek! They spoke Aramaic! The Aramaic language has no double-sense word that fits here, but a single-sense word mille’ela = “from above” and another single-sense word tanyanut = “again, anew”. Clearly, Jesus used the latter, since that is how Nocodemus understood it and a misunderstanding is ruled out in the original language.

Later, Jesus says: “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.” This seems to make no sense. Here, the word pneuma occurs twice in the Greek text, and has first been translated as “wind” and later as “Spirit”. Pneuma means “wind” and in an indirect sense “spirit” – but also “soul”, that which makes the body alive, the “breath of life” (cf. Hebrew ruah). The latter meaning is common in religious texts. Furthermore, “sound” is here a translation of the Greek phoné, which rather means “voice”. Hence an alternative and correct translation is: “The soul goes where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice [whispering] thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born with a soul.” Now it makes sense. Jesus talks about preexistence: The soul comes from somewhere, where it was before, and goes on to somewhere else when the body dies. Of course, preexistence doesn’t necessarily mean reincarnation – but reincarnation necessarily involves preexistence…

'''Whom say people that I am? Luke 9:18-19:''' --
Jesus said: “’Whom say the people that I am?’ They answering said ‘John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again’.” John the Baptist would obviously not be possible, but the other alternatives indicate that some people in him saw a possible reincarnation of Elias or another old prophet.

'''Origen and reincarnation:''' --
Origen’s relevant original texts were burnt in the 6th century. The only texts remaining to-day are the Latin translations by Rufinus and Hieronymus, the latter only in fragments. Both admit in the introduction to the translation that they have adjusted the text to fit the Dogma and omitted certain “offensive” parts. Thus, clearly, if Origen had written positively about reincarnation, they will have omitted that or changed its wording.

Through burning the original texts, the Church has withdrawn for itself the grounds for proving its allegation that Origen would have contradicted reincarnation.

'''The anathemata against Origen:''' --
In the protocols of the Council in Constantinople of 553, the condemnations of Origen were mentioned. They were not a subject discussed in the council itself, but this merely confirmed a condemnation formulated ten years earlier in a local synod in Constantinople. The Council instead dealt with the “three Chapters”, three texts by long dead bishops, now condemned as heretical. But before the Council was opened, waiting for the pope to appear, emperor Justinian presented the text from 543 and requested the bishops present to sign it. The pope didn’t come and the Council, therefore, wasn’t opened yet. A week later they gathered again, but the pope didn’t agree and still didn’t come. The emperor, therefore, declared the Council opened without the presence of the pope, clearly against the rules for a Council.

Emperor Justinian wrote in his edict against Origen, in which he ordered the condemnation at the synod of 543, that, according to Origen: “spiritual entities were fallen in sin and as punishment banned into bodies… becoming imprisoned in a body a second and a third time or even still more times…”

The first anathema reads: “If anyone assert the fabulous pre-existence of souls, and shall assert the monstrous restoration which follows from it: let him be anathema.” The Greek words here translated as “monstrous restoration” are teratodi apokatastasin. Apokatastasis normally refers to the restoration of God’s creation in its original holy order, which is certainly not monstrous… hence it will here refer to something else, but to what? Does it refer to the restoration of a new body for the soul? This would truly be “monstrous” to the Dogma… This may be a reference to reincarnation, without mentioning it by name. And if so, it confirms that Origen was viewed as advocating reincarnation.

Since the condemnation of Origen isn’t a decision by an allegedly “infallible” Council, it has never been officially forbidden to the Christian to believe in preexistence, nor in reincarnation…

'''The Council in Nicaea in 325:''' --
It has been repeatedly alleged that belief in reincarnation was condemned during the Council in Nicaea in 325. No reference to that is found in protocols of the Council. However, it is known that these protocols are incomplete. Parts of them are missing. It is also known that emperor Constantine didn’t allow the Gnostic Christians to speak at the Council and that he gave their propositions and petitions to the fire without opening them. It is historically documented that most of the Gnostic Christians believed in reincarnation, but he didn’t give them the chance to present their views.

'''The third and fourth generation? Num. 14:18:''' --
“The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.” If this were so, it would be a horrible injustice to punish innocent children, grandchildren and so on for what an ancestor did! And what “mercy” would that be? Such an interpretation is contradicted in Deut. 24:16: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.” The Christian Gnostics interpreted the text in Num. 14:18 as referring to the “third and forth incarnation” of a sinner. That would be just…

== Christianity and Reincarnation ==

The existing page says that "Christian doctrine" rejects the concept of reincarnation even though 24% of American Christians believe in it and 31% of regular churchgoing Catholics in Europe expressed a belief in reincarnation.

It seems to me that the term "Christian doctrine" is innacurately global.  It does not recognize that there is huge diversity in the doctrines of any number of Christian churches on any number of subjects, e.g., the virgin birth, baptism by immersion, transubstantiation, justification by faith alone, creationism vs. evolution, gay marriage, to name a few.

It does seem to me that most MAINLINE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES reject the concept of reincarnation, but there are many denominations, some of which do not claim to have any doctrines, and so, therefore, some may entertain the possibility of reincarnation.  It would be extremely difficult to exhaustively research the doctrines of hundreds of Christian denominations.

At the same time, a reliable source--Geddes MacGregor, Emeritus Distringuished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southern California and an Episcopal priest--concludes that belief in Christianity and belief in reincarnation are not mutually exclusive.  See cites from Quest <ref>[http://www.questbooks.net/title.cfm?bookid=350]</ref> and Amazon <ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Reincarnation-Christianity-Rebirth-Christian-Thought/dp/0835605019/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1298862956&sr=1-3]</ref> where sample pages are available.

I see value in deleting the reference to "Christian doctrine" and replacing it with "mainline Christian churches" and adding a reference to MacGregor's work.

I apologize if this post is in the wrong place or if I should have appended it to someone else's subject because I didn't see an easy way to do this.  I'm new to Wikipedia and appreciate the guidance I've received from Dr. K and a Macedonian so far.  I don't wish to argue, simply make observations from my perspective with hope that the Wikipedia community will see value in my observation, or at least that it will spark a discussion that eventually lead to consensus on the subject.

I'm glad that there are people who are willing and able to spend a lot more time on this than I am.

:I am not a Christian so I have no bias in what is included. It seems to me that every major Christian denomination rejects reincarnation. Christian doctrine is the official teachings of the church, not what people think. In my view it would be right to say "it is generally accepted that Christian doctrine..." and then add a single sentence giving Prof MacGregor's view that they are compatible with a citation.

:I don't think that you could change "Christian doctrine" to "mainline Christian churches" unless you find and cite a church that is generally accepted to be Christian that ''explicitly'' accepts reincarnation.

I've seen the History Channel documentary ''Hitler and the Occult'' more than once. HC is a legitimate resource. Hitler's suicide on April 30 and his command to have his body burned was no 'coincidence' - ''There Are No Coincidences (there is synchronism)''.

== Hinduism ==

Thanks for the helpful text on this theme, [[User:‎Kapil.xerox|‎Kapil.xerox]].

Regarding the current wording in Hinduism section. The article says reincarnation idea is non-Vedic? Not true. Quoting from "The Brahmasutras and their principal commentaries by B.N.K. Sharma" - Rig Veda 4:27:1-2 record the experiences of Vamadeva on the basis of awareness of his own former lives. RV 4:26:1 goes on to say (of Vamadeva) - "I was Manu and Surya. I was Rsi Kaksivan the Brahmin". Madhva in his commentary on the Brahmasutras uses these sruthi verses in the aphorism 1:1:28-31 of the Brahmasutras Antaryami Pranadhikaranam. Could someone repsond on this issue? If not, I can go ahead and provide this quotation in support of reincarnation in the RV to add to the already present RV verses.

== Stevenson et al ==

Mentioning the research on reincarnation done by Stevenson et al seems perfectly proper...why would it be giving undue weight to peer-reviewed research to mention this in one sentence, especially since critical responses are also included? -- Also, though the mention of particular works is not necessary here, links to the titles of their works do not seem terribly obnoxious.

:::::Stevenson's research and "reincarnation research" in general is of minor significance to the topic of the article. It is fringe, at best, and has not been widely recived in the academic community. By far most of it has been published in books and journals with no semblence of academic review, primarily his own sham journal. This work is not widely cited by independent scholars in their own peer-reviewed work, and has indeed been largely ignored. Those who have examined it have found it wanting to the point of being implausible at best, methodologically flawed to the point of being useless, or just plain pseudoscience. His credibility in this field is irreparably damaged by the fact that he set up a fake journal in which to promote himself and his work. Few scholars writing about reincarnation in real academic sources mention Stevenson, and there is no evidence that academic experts on reincarnation even know that he existed. To give more than a very brief allusion to it in this article violates [[WP:WEIGHT]] and [[WP:ONEWAY]].

== Don't most Jews believe in reincarnation? ==

I was told by a rabbi at a forum that pretty much all Orthodox Jews, both Sephard and Ashkenazi, believe in Kabbalah, and, therefore, in reincarnation, contrary to what this Wikipedia article is saying. Which is not to say that many actually know Kabbalah; most simply don't get that far in their studies. The source seemed authoritative, and was not contradicted by anyone else, so I'd say it's worth checking.

I was told Moroccan Jews are the largest exception of that rule. 

You don't hear much about reincarnation because 1) Jews are not encouraged to  prozelitize, and 2) Judaism was born as an anti-Egyptian religion of sorts, and as a result, the Egyptian obsession with the afterlife is discouraged. Jews are pretty much told that this world is what matters now, everything else we are going to find out when we get there. But yes, I believe reincarnation is a bigger part of Judaism than the article says.

== Mormonism ==

The main article suggests merging pre-existence with reincarnation. Pre-existence is a very big deal in Mormonism, and is completely different from reincarnation. Even for non-Mormons, pre-existence does not have to mean physically existing or existing on this world or with a different name. Pre-existence and reincarnation are fundamentally different. For this reason I vote to keep the topics separate. [[Special:Contributions/85.211.155.41|85.211.155.41]] ([[User talk:85.211.155.41|talk]]) 15:58, 5 May 2013 (UTC)

The following text was removed from the lead: "and the Shia sects such as the [[Alawi]] Shias". Does anyone know whether this group incorporates beliefs in reincarnation? Should the text be restored or not? [[User:Hgilbert|hgilbert]] ([[User talk:Hgilbert|talk]]) 00:36, 14 June 2013 (UTC)


I suggest that preexistence should not be merged with reincarnation, because in some religious sects the belief is that the current birth is the only one and the soul exists before the current birth till it is ready to take birth.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ddmisra|Ddmisra]] ([[User talk:Ddmisra|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ddmisra|contribs]]) 23:51, 18 June 2013 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Non-personal reincarnation ==

I believe that some people believe that reincarnation is possible without there being a soul. For example, in buddhism, the empty not-self is reborn every time one dies (according to some schools). The core of the being is not a singular entity (anatman), but just pure consciousness, without "I".

In the concept of [[trikaya]], there are three bodies that describe something that is a bit like a soul. The pure everything-that-exist-at-once dharmakaya being like the atmosphere, the intermediary sambhogakaya being like clouds and the experience-of-being-a-human nirmanakaya being like the rain that falls from the clouds. The dharmakaya is eternal, while clouds move over the surface of the earth and the rain being our temporary experiences as humans. 

Here, the "I" is just a temporary manifestation of something entirely different, and not at all like what we usually mean with a soul. I would say that this is a belief that does not include souls (or an I) at all. The concept of a soul is merely added so that we (people with a western culture) have words to use for describing it.

== African vodun section ==

On investigation of the link and book title, I removed the most obvious promotional material from this section, but have the impression that the whole section relies on a spurious source. There is better more authoritative, well-researched material out there. Generally, the terminology is not classic to writings on vodun/voudon/voodoo.

== 'Reincarnation...now scientifically confirmed concept' ==

''''''Reincarnation''' is the religious or philosophical concept - and now scientifically confirmed concept...''' I added "now scientifically confirmed concept" because the book [[Soul Survivor]] strongly documents reincarnation. ''Reincarnation Theory & its 23 Principles/Theory of Luck (ex. Einstein returned as Watson)'' (http://7seals.blogspot.com ) is another strong scientific proof as is all the work of [[Dr. Ian Stevenson]] and his associates at [[University Of Virginia]] and the many psychiatrists practicing [[past-life regression]]. - Benjamin Franklin [[Special:Contributions/75.74.157.29|75.74.157.29]] ([[User talk:75.74.157.29|talk]]) 00:04, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

::It's correct WP policy to remove this passage, but it's worth noting that science doesn't make claims one way or another about reincarnation, which is outside its remit, and that there is certainly no "scientific consensus" about the subject. Some scientists make such claims, but without any scientific basis for either side of the issue, they are just expressing personal beliefs. And no, a few skeptics who are not specialists in a field do not a consensus make. [[User:Hgilbert|HGilbert]] ([[User talk:Hgilbert|talk]]) 10:39, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

and the scientists are arguing for Shariah law all over the western world, which means they are duffases.

Nostradamus speaks openly about it, but it is in Early modern era latin, and a part of his private correspondence, and a difficult book to find, UCLA and Cal Berkeley have each a copy. 

Scientists at Cal make weapons to harm and kill defenseless humans, how  can you argue they are the boarder guards, duffasses?

== Orphaned references in [[:Reincarnation]] ==

I check pages listed in [[:Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting]] to try to fix reference errors. One of the things I do is look for content for [[User:AnomieBOT/docs/OrphanReferenceFixer|orphaned references]] in wikilinked articles. I have found content for some of [[:Reincarnation]]'s orphans, the problem is that I found more than one version. I can't determine which (if any) is correct for ''this'' article, so I am asking for a sentient editor to look it over and copy the correct ref content into this article.
