== Rename Google Inc. to Alphabet Inc.? ==
Why create a new article, according to Larry Page, Google Inc. is replaced by Alphabet Inc., all shares for GOOG will be changed to Alphabet, etc. Google Inc. ceases to exist, it's practically just a rebrand.
"Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publicly-traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG.", as written on [http://abc.xyz abc.xyz]. --[[User:YannickFran|YannickFran]] ([[User talk:YannickFran|talk]]) 21:29, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

== Disputed ==
We're all getting ahead of ourselves. Alphabet is still a subsidiary of Google (rather than Google a subsidiary of Alphabet). The restructuring was just announced hours ago hasn't happened yet. This article is describing future events is past or present terms. Just because there was an announcement, doesn't mean it has happened. The stock swap GOOGL/GOOG stock swap hasn't even happened yet. Although, as we speak, Google is probably transferring assets into Alphabet to prepare for the stock swap, which should be considered current events.

Nice work correcting the article, but I think the [[Alphabet Inc.#Process|Process]] section has the definition of "merger all wrong. A merger is when two or more companies disband and fold their operations into one new company. This is a different kind of corporate restructuring that doesn't meet the definition of "merger." [[User:Tcrow777|Tcrow777]]<sup> [[User talk:Tcrow777|Talk]]</sup> 09:15, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

==In popular culture section==
This section about hooli.xyz and ''Silicon Valley'' TV series may be arguable as a relevant section for Alphabet. Some editors may opt to keep it adding some more relevant focus or link to Alphabet. Some others may prefer to delete it altogether.

:: Actually the section was titled "Easter eggs" earlier before I retitled it "Trivia". I am renaming it for now as "In Popular Culture" instead. I thought Easter eggs was an even more odd term to keep on the page! Naming of section can be amended, but calling it Easter eggs was unacceptable.

::The section is still a stub. "In popular culture" isn't quite right either, because Alphabet isn't being referenced in pop culture, but rather Alphabet is referencing the series in the easter egg. "Easter egg" is actually a more focused name, and is better than either "trivia" (meaning misc. info) or "in popular culture."

== New names for some "Google ..." formatted subsidiaries? ==
It appears that some of the companies previously called "Google something" are going to drop the Google from their name.

:We shouldn't rush to decide articles name yet. Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]] we have to use commonly recognizable names. Google's Fiber network is still prominent as "Google Fiber", not "Fiber (Alphabet Inc.)". Even most reliable sources still call it "Google Fiber" at the moment. This could change after the restructuring is complete. Until then I think we should keep using "Google Fiber" as the article title.

== Relevance in lead section ==
Someone has challenged the relevance of the last two sentences in the top section. IMO, these sentences are absolutely relevant. The CEO of Alphabet and future CEO of Google is absolutely relevant, as well as the stock tickers, which is probably the first piece of info web searchers would want to know.

: Sorry but I'm reverting this back. This is not consensus. Keep the tags and allow the discussions to flow for several days. This is not relevant at all for the lead. It is entirely irrelevant for the Alphabet article to state in the lead who will lead Google. This relevant for the Google article but not for Alphabet lead section. Furthermore, a lead is a concise summary of the article that does not have to include intricate details important for a specialised audience. The lead is a general overview of the subject. Intricate details go into the body, not the lead.

== Alphabet status ==
So if you look at the copyright citation at the end of https://abc.xyz, it says Alphabet Inc. This means that the company has already been legally incorporated enough to hold copyright. While the merger hasn't taken place yet as far as we know, the company still exists. We ought to continue speaking in the future tense about the company as far as how to it will end up, but it suspect that its current status is as a dummy subsidiary of Google until the merger takes place. I think it would be inappropriate to talk about the company in its present status in the article as it's just that way as a legal expedient; instead, we should talk about how it is going to function in the long run, that being as the parent-umbrella company like we do now. --[[User:krimin_killr21|krimin_killr21]]([[User talk:Krimin killr21|talk]]) 07:12, 20 September 2015 (UTC)

== The "Restructuring process" doesn't make sense ==
Quote: ''"Alphabet was created as a subsidiary directly owned by Google Inc.

Then Google merged with that dummy subsidiary while converting Google stock to Alphabet stock. The post-merger subsidiary, no longer a dummy, changed its name to "Alphabet Inc."''

So, at very beginning, A is G's subsidiary. Then a dummy subsidiary of A (a grandchildren company of G then) created: let's call it D. Then G merged with its grandchildren company D, so it became A's subsidiary. But how could "The post-merger subsidiary, no longer a dummy, changed its name to "Alphabet Inc.""? "Post-merger subsidiary" here could be ambiguous, but followed by "no longer a dummy", I assume it means the one created by merging of G and D.

:Regarding Drummond he is just it for Google as per this source.[https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/people/1952796-david-c-drummond] However with Porat she does hold both positions as per.[https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/people/2536317-ruth-m-porat] --[[User:Emir of Wikipedia|Emir of Wikipedia]] ([[User talk:Emir of Wikipedia|talk]]) 12:42, 9 September 2017 (UTC)
::I believe you mean Drummond just for Alphabet (like it is in the source)? Anyway, although I don't doubt Bloomberg's reliability, these 'overview'-esque pages are not usually satisfactory. Nontheless, I'll edit out both pages to reflect what is said, yet I hope be find better sources for the cases at some point.

:::Oh yeah. I meant just for Alphabet not Google, but I found two better sources.

== DIVISIONS ==

Business segment (Business Division) or simply Division is used to categories each business or services a company is in and they operate as corporate units in the case of Disney or subsidiaries in case of Time Warner.
:Google is an operating subsidiary of Alphabet incorporated as Google LLC under the laws of Delaware. By our definition, that is not a division. If you can provide sources that say Google is not incorporated, and as such a division, the info may be inserted, though as long as that is not the case, it shall not be included in the article.

:[[Template:Infobox company]] says {{TQ|The primary functional or operational business divisions of a company, listed alphabetically. These divisions align with the internal organizational structure of the company and may or may not align with the company's legally incorporated subsidiaries. If there is more than one entry, use ubl to format the entries. If there are more than five divisions and the article body lists them or discusses them, consider linking to that part of the article rather than listing them in the infobox.}} --[[User:Emir of Wikipedia|Emir of Wikipedia]] ([[User talk:Emir of Wikipedia|talk]]) 19:53, 6 November 2017 (UTC)
