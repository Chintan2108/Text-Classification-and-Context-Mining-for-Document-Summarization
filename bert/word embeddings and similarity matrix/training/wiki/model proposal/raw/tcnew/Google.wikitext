== Criticism - Jon von Tetzchner ==

== Misplaced paragraph under the Acquisitions and Partnerships headline ==

The paragraph "On August 23, 2018, Google deleted 39 YouTube accounts, 13 Google+ accounts and 6 blogs on Blogger due to their engagement in politically motivated phishing, the deleted accounts were found to be tied with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)" seems out of place under the headline "Acquisitions and partnerships" since every other entry is some form of purchase or sale. I edited to remove that paragraph with that reason but it was reverted with a cryptic commit message. I'm thinking that information fits better in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google since no other specific instance of censorship seems to be mentioned in the main article (?).

:controvsey is listed in the wiki's main page of most major companies, but ommitted in google's main page---there's  no reference to the constrovsy in [[history of google]], nor a summary of it. i suggest to revive a section on summarizing  controvsey in the main page. After all, wiki is not a fan's page. [[User: Yau | Yau]]-- 1 May 2006

::There is a 'see also' link in the history section to the 'recent criticisms and controversies'. This is sufficient.

==Evil?==

This article states that the company code of conduct is "Don't be evil."  I'm fairly certain it is actually "Do no evil."  However, I can't find any online evidence for this (or the other one).

Is the conspiracy theory that Google is a front/in cahoots with the NSA still considered too whacko for inclusion amongst the criticisms and controversies section?

:Hm...depends on just how many people actually put that idea forth. I think a more immediate problem right now we can flesh out in further detail is the criticism surrounding their caving-in to Chinese censorship. I can tell people are pretty upset by that.

== rv. infobox removal ==

TakuyaMurata:
:Replacing the infobox with an HTML table is nonsensical considering that all that needless code is precisely the reason why templates exist. If you're going to make nonsensical edits, you'll have to edit every article that uses a template and ''attempt'' your replacement. Go ahead. Try it. I dare you. Start with [[Harvard University]]. Let's see how far you get. [[User:Adraeus|Adraeus]] 01:11, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:It actually has some point. The beauty of wiki is that you don't have to learn how to write a page. With the template, you first need to ''learn'' what parameters are and how they would be renderred. With a wiki-table (not that was not HTML one by the way), it is easy to see for newbies how the table is made. Anyway this is an explanation why I replaced the template by a table, I am not going to to convince you since I can now see a trend of an infobox. Incidentaly, fixing errors is always the way to go, regardless of whether it is hard to do or not. -- 18:12, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)

== Google's innovativeness and sense of humour ==

Google has a couple of innovations
* Uncluttered interface at a time when sites wanted to add more links and more features, thus cluttering their webpages.
* Built in calculator
* Modifying the Google logo to signify certain events
* I'm feeling lucky

Sense of humour
* PigeonRank
* Recruiting on the moon
* GMail news released on Apr 1 was thought to be a joke
* The link to lunar.google.com has been removed - it should be added in again (as it is pretty funny when you zoom all the way in to the surface)
-NOTE: This page is now situated at [http://moon.google.com moon.google.com]

These might be included in the article.


::This list of features are things that someone may want to add to a relevant section of the article or a spinoff article. However, the phrase 'Goggle is well known for its innovative, clean products' is, on its own, vague and a matter of personal opinion.

== languages: Leet ==

Looking at the Google site, it doesn't seem that Leet is offered any longer as a language. For another joke language, Google currently offers Elmer Fudd ("I'm Feewing Wucky!").

== 'Googol' vs. 'Google' ==

I had added the story about the check being made out to 'Google, Inc.' back when they were looking for investors, and that is how the misspelling is now the name of the company.  The story was deleted a few days later, saying it was false.  I found the source so I'll be putting it back in...

"Unable to interest the major portal players of the day, Larry and Sergey decided to make a go of it on their own. All they needed was a little cash to move out of the dorm — and to pay off the credit cards they had maxed out buying a terabyte of memory. So they wrote up a business plan, put their Ph.D. plans on hold, and went looking for an angel investor. Their first visit was with a friend of a faculty member.

Andy Bechtolsheim, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, was used to taking the long view. One look at their demo and he knew Google had potential — a lot of potential. But though his interest had been piqued, he was pressed for time. As Sergey tells it, "We met him very early one morning on the porch of a Stanford faculty member's home in Palo Alto. We gave him a quick demo. He had to run off somewhere, so he said, 'Instead of us discussing all the details, why don't I just write you a check?' It was made out to Google Inc. and was for $100,000."

The investment created a small dilemma. Since there was no legal entity known as "Google Inc.," there was no way to deposit the check. It sat in Larry's desk drawer for a couple of weeks while he and Sergey scrambled to set up a corporation and locate other funders among family, friends, and acquaintances. Ultimately they brought in a total initial investment of almost $1 million."

source: [http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html]

:Why did you insert this story in the Etymology section of the article?  Larry and his officemates already had come up with the name (and spelling) Google by mid-September 1997, prior to the visit with Bechtolsheim.  Thus, this story has nothing to do with the etymology of the name Google.

::I think there's been a misunderstanding of the point of the quoted passage - the non-existence of anything called "Google Inc" was not because that wasn't its name, but simply because it ''didn't exist yet''. The section just above that quoted already mentions "Google, as it was now known" but the meeting with Bechtolsheim was to show their business plan and demo - not to ask for investment in a pre-existing company - so there was simply no account to pay a cheque into yet. Google was already the name of their project, but you can't pay a cheque into a project. [I'll fix the article in a sec] - [[User:IMSoP|IMSoP]] 17:38, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

A play on words by definition needs two sides to it. Despite what Google says, I don't see any play on words in the name Google -- it's just a misspelling. I haven't changed anything yet, but I think if we are to keep this 'etymology', it must be explained what the play on words is.[[User:JudahH|JudahH]] 01:17, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

==Rename the April Fools section?==
I think it would be appropriate to rename the April Fool's Day Jokes section of the article to Jokes by Google (or something like that).  Why you ask?  Becuase not all of the jokes that Google have done are on April Fools day - take today for example if you click [http://moon.google.com/ here] and zoom all the way in it shows "cheese".  Also related to google moon are [http://www.google.com/help/faq_moon.html this], a FAQ about Google moon, and [http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html this] a site about a new center Google is "building" on the moon.

== anyone think the search results are biased? ==

Heres why I think so, I did a search for; [[career]] and the least desired results is what I got.

1. 268,000,000- 271,000,000 results found

2. The first results on the first page was dispointing mostly big company based websites.. and i'm not very enthuastic to find a job through those sites.

After skipping forward about 98+ pages it reverted to 86 pages and the list was ommited with only 851 - 860 results shown. with 268,000,000 found.

The second time after ommited results were accepted It stopped at 100 with only 991 - 993 results shown. with 271,000,000 found.

So the about 271,000,000 million other pages were never shown. and quite frankly(I don't normally say that) I think google isn't as big as what they claim. I dont really know if more results is benificial or less is. Just a little obversation from using google daily

:I think this bias is an inherent part of [[PageRank]] itself. To get answers to some of your queries regarding the comprehensiveness, I can ask you to read [http://aixtal.blogspot.com/2005/02/web-googles-missing-pages-mystery.html this]. -- [[User:Sundar|Sundar]] <sup>\[[User talk:Sundar|talk]] \[[Special:Contributions/Sundar|contribs]]</sup> 08:41, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

== Number of employees ==

The article states that there are 4000 people working for google, whereas the factbox states that there are only 3000. Maybe this could be investigated further.

:Well, if I remember right, one of the founders themselves wasn't too shure about the # of Googlers. --[[User:Jmchuff|Jason McHuff]] 07:56, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

== Spelling mistake? ==
[[Googol]] says the spelling of Google was a spelling mistake, and has a quote.  However, this entry claims the spelling was a "play" on the word, implying that it was intentional.  Which is right?
:This [http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html] link at google's website says its a play on the phrase, but that may be an oversimplification or a cover up since there is some evidence that it was a mistkae.  [[User:BrokenSegue|This link is]] [[User talk:BrokenSegue|'''B'''roken]] 01:27, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

I heard somewhere that, when the two founders of Google were trying to invent a name for their new search service, they struck on the word Googol, but misspelled it.  When this was pointed out to them, they decided to keep the original (incorrect,) spelling, rather than change it to the less 'trendy' (i.e. slightly awkward,) Googol.  In true Google fashion, spelling doesn't get in the way of anything!

== Hardware ==

I added some additional information about the original hardware Google used. It may be incorrect as I was going off this site: http://web.archive.org/web/19990209043945/google.stanford.edu/googlehardware.html (which was the original google site)... however the images won't load.

If anyone knows the exact hardware they used, it would be interesting to note.

I also added the Google logos. If anyone knows of any other official logos and also year dates for the cutrrent logos, please add them.

== Logo ==

I removed the logos which were added above because when I looked at googles site they had the said logos listed under "fan logos" so it seemed it was misleading to list them as previous versions of the official logo.  In it's place there is now a link to the [http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html Google holiday logos].  It feels an awkward place for it so it should probably be moved someplace else.  Cheers, [[User:Flyer_13|flyer_13]] [[User talk:Flyer_13|talk]]  03:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

===Logo's are Official Logos!===

The logos I have had to add twice now because people have been removing them are actually the official logos which Google had used since their beginnings. Yes google has them listed under fan logos, but if you actually read the text, it says: '' Finally, here are progressively older versions of our logo, dating back to the days before we were Google...'' For God's Sake!

Logo's put back again, hopefully for the last time.

:As you quoted these logos are simple tests did before the company even existed (they cannot therefore be offical logos). I really don't think that they have to mentioned since they are not notable. [[User:Corti|Matteo]] 08:23, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

I moved the 'etymology' section (previously under history) back to the opening paragraph. I believe that this information is important enough to warrant being mentioned up front. I also do not think it belongs as a sub-section under 'history' because, while it can be considered a part of the history of the company, it does not seem to fit in with the order of the story being told in that section.

Googirl's name and layout were choosen as a mere tribute to what we consider to be the best search engine of the world, and represents our hope to become the best celebrity pictures search engine."

==Article Cleanup==
I just finished a major clean-up of this article. The history section has been shorted, and much content has been moved to a new [[History of Google]] article. I also moved the entire controversy section over to the history of google article as well (after all, today's controversy is tomorrow's history, eh?).

The external links have also been cleaned up greatly, removing much of the linkspam, and moving many of the links to news articles to references within the text. The article now makes use of [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]], so future news article references should now make use of that format. Any external links inserted without the footnote formatting should ideally be converted to this format. The primary reason for this is that, if we insert the author, title, publication, and date information into the reference, instead of just the link, if the site is later removed by the original publisher, we still have information regarding where the citation came from and can still track it down.

== Consensus on Other links ==

I think we need to arrive at some kind of consensus as to what kind of links belong in the "Other links" subsection of "External links." Should these be non-Google sites about Google? Sites offering deeper understanding of Google? Sites offfering critical views on Google? What kind of Other links would add value to an encyclopedic article about Google? Thoughts?

Meanwhile, there has been a minor [[revert war]] on whether www.google-watch.org or www.scroogle.org should be there. Often when these are deleted, the link to [http://www.google.vc/ Google.vc] (for "very cool") remains. IMO, if any of these should remain it would be Google Watch, with some kind of description like "site critical of Google." A link to Scroogle seems perhaps more appropriate for the [[Google and privacy issues]] article, although I'm not even sure about that. The Google.vc link seems entirely superfluous to an encyclopedic article about Google.  --[[User:Mtz206|mtz206]] 20:23, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

I was also thinking that it might be a good spot to put a link to Google X Directory which is being archived [http://google-x.blogspot.com/ Google X Directory] It is a google portal and just as relative if not more than the Google Watch or Scroogle links.

I just looked at google-x, and I think I'm missing the point.  The only relationship I can see with Google is that it uses Blogspot and Google's search engine results to sell advertising space.  From what I've seen, I really don't think it belongs.  As for other links, I agree completely with [[User:Mtz206|mtz206]]. --[[User:Straif|Straif]] 19:20, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

So that it is clear what I've done (and to hopefully prevent future [[revert war|revert wars]]), I removed the link to [http://www.google.vc/ Google.vc] entirely; it didn't belong.  There are wiki articles for [[Google Watch]] and [[Scroogle]].  As internal links are always preferable to external, I added them to the overly long See also: list, and removed the external links. --[[User:Straif|Straif]] 19:40, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:And I just removed the [[Google Watch]] and [[Scroogle]] links from the See also: list.  The list is too long as it is, and there are links to those to articles in the Google Inc. box.

There are now no links whatsoever from this article to [[Google Maps]], [[Google Earth]], and other google products.  Seems to me, the brief section on google searches (products) should be readded, so those links are present in the article.  -[[User:AudeVivere|Aude]] (<small>[[User_talk:AudeVivere|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/AudeVivere|contribs]]</small>) 00:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:The article at once had links to every single google subdomain and product that they offered, which I found to be cluttered and unnecessary. There is also a specific article, [[List of Google services and tools]], which contains information (and links) to all of Google's products and services. This is where this information should go. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 04:23, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

::I disagree on this.  I looked through the article and missed [[List of Google services and tools]] buried at the bottom among all the "See also" links.  Certainly a list of products isn't the right format.  But we should be using [[Wikipedia:Summary style|summary style]] and give a brief summary of their products and services in prose form.  Like maybe, discuss when the *key* products were introduced and their impact/significance.  Some like [[Google Maps]] had a major impact, with their use of [[Ajax]] and on market share versus [[MapQuest]] ([[AOL]]), [[Yahoo!]], etc.  [[Google Print]] sparked some heated debate between [[Google]] and the publishing industry over copyright issues.  [[Gmail]], [[Froogle]], and [[Google News]] are also in my opinion, worth a brief mention.  Do we need to list every Google product in this main article? No, but a brief summary with a <nowiki>{{main|List of Google services and tools}}</nowiki>? Yes.  Certainly discussion of their products and services is more noteworthy for inclusion here than discussion of "April Fool's Day jokes". -[[User:AudeVivere|Aude]] (<small>[[User_talk:AudeVivere|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/AudeVivere|contribs]]</small>) 15:20, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:::Ok, I see your point. This is actually somewhat important information. Though I don't really like the name 'specific searches'. I've added a 'Products and Services' section, right under the 'History' section. I don't really want this to end up as merely a list of links and sorts, and I've added a main link to [[List of Google services and tools]].

== POV ==

Googleplex seems to make out Google is a great place to work. POV. [[User:212.135.1.49|212.135.1.49]] 08:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

:Are any of the stated facts in dispute?  It is a rather glowing description (makes me want to work there), but how does that make it POV?  What are the drawbacks to working at the Googleplex (are they specific to Googleplex, or are they about working for Google--if the latter, then perhaps the tag should be moved).  The description does seem a little unbalanced, but is there good, verifiable information that could be added to moderate the tone?  Basically, what I'm saying here is that saying the section "seems to make out Google is a great place to work" doesn't convince ''me'' that it it is POV.  I need more explanation than that.  --[[User:Straif|Straif]] 12:28, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

:I disagree. I don't think it's POV at all. Providing information about a companies corporate headquarters is ok for articles. And what are you going to say that's negative anyway, "the bathrooms stink and the basement is filled with rats?" I do think that it would help to add a reference to this text, which would back up the claims. Most of the information in the paragraph seems to have been taken from [http://www.google.com/corporate/culture.html Google's own Corporate Culture] page. I would think an independent reference from another publication or website would be a better reference, however. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 20:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

==External Links==
* Please read: [[Wikipedia:External links]]
* Can anyone explain to me what value the link to http://www.google.vc/ adds?  Don't get me wrong, it is a nifty site, but I'm not clear if it really adds any value to what is already a long article (especially since it already overwhelming with all the wikilinks).  I've removed it a couple times, giving my reasoning both in the summary, and once in talk.  It is promptly replaced without comment.  I'm not the first one to remove it (and have it quickly replaced).  I'm not interested in getting in an edit war, and clearly there is at least one person that feels this link belongs.  That being said; without so much as an edit summary, I have no idea why that person feels the link belongs.
* There are two other links, www.google-watch.org and www.scroogle.org, that I've removed only to see them reappear, and again it looks like this is an ongoing trend.  They both have Wikipedia articles ([[Google Watch]] and [[Scroogle]]) '''and''' the [[Google]] article links to them.  It seems to me like an unnecessary duplication.  Does this redundancy add value?  Also where the person/organization that runs both sites is extremely critical of Google, I think that if one or both links do stay, that bias should be clearly noted--honesty is good. --[[User:Straif|Straif]] 14:42, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

What makes this site important enough to be included when others aren't?  More importantly, how does it expand on the article?  Links to Google and its various projects are, of course, important as they are directly related to the facts discussed.  Sites with verifiable sources of information (such as pertinent journal articles) <i>might</i> be useful (although it is generally better to add the information, no plagiarism ;), and site the article).

:: [[User:SubSeven|SubSeven]] hasn't given a complete inductive proof.  It is still necessary for 10 to the (n+1)th power to be EXACTLY ten times 10 to the nth power, for ''any'' n.  But how many times can Google's stock increase ten-fold?  Certainly not more than ten times per quarter.  The question then becomes: after 100 quarters (25 years) are there enough dollars in all the universe to represent Google's stock?  The answer, surprisingly enough, is that after 25 years there won't ''be'' dollars -- only Google stock.  So, no, Google isn't equivalent to ten to the one hundredth, at least as far as inductive mathematics is concerned.  Hope this helps.

Are there any (or, does anyone knows that) lawsuit prosecuting the individual sellers for their selling counterfeit brand-named shoes (e.g. PRADA, Gucci, BAPE) on the ebay? Or, the shoe companies just prosecute the ebay company as supplying a platform for people to sell fake/counterfeit PRADA, Gucci shoes through ebay?

Are there any laws set up in the USA, Uk and other European countries against the counterfeit Gucci/PRADA shoes on ebay? Or, those genuine companies are just not aware of this yet?

But, will it be reasonable and right to ban for selling the fake shoes on Ebay, as a online e-commerce platform?

== Wikipedia & Google ==
All around Wikipedia, there has been much discussion of what could from a collaboration between Wikipedia & Google, listing lots of possible pros and cons, and how it could benefit both companies. While a partnership is all up to executives of the Wikimedia Foundation & Google Inc., I propose the creation of an article where Wikipedians could explore the issue. There are dozens of articles dedicated to defining different parts of both internet companies, and lots of talk about their relationship, so a entire article dedicated to the possibilities might be beneficial. I could create the article myself, but I would like feedback to see if its appropriate or not. I'm not positive if it fits into Wikipedia's policies, so I step cautiously. I don't want anyone to shoot me down for this proposal, even if it turns out to be a bad one, I just want to explore an idea.--[[User:Wikiphilia|Wikiphilia]] 22:09, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

:Such a thing would not be appropriate for an article, but more for the [[WP:Community Portal]] area, if it were to develop.
:The only collaboration, per se, between Wikipedia & Google, is more or less some limited sponsorship funds that Google has donated, in terms of servers and/or bandwidth, to Wikipedia. There's really not much for individual Wikipedians to do to really add to this, and really not appropriate without either a) Google explicitly going to the Wikipedia community and asking for assistance with something, or b) Jimbo Wales himself talking with Google and mediating some sort of official program involving individual Wikipedians. It's probably best to leave the ball in Google's court regarding how they wish to partake in official sponsorship activities. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 02:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

== External link proposal ==

For some weird reason the article tells me that I have to discuss a external link here before I add it. So here is my external link candidate: [http://www.baselinemag.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=182560,00.asp How Google Works]. This article gives a lot of extra information about google that I don't find anywhere else. After adding this article as external link we can use this information to improve the wikipedia-article and then use the article as a reference instead of a external link.
Opions please. --[[User:Garo|Garo]] 09:57, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:The link is really not an 'external link' for the external links section, and would have little value there. There could be information in it that could be incorporated into the article, and referenced using the 'ref' tags (references section). Listings in external links should actually be more for links that have more broad and wide-ranging information on the subject and not just merely for a listing of a bunch of journal articles. We also have to be very careful with making links to journal articles, since different online publications have different policies regarding how long something is available publicly; yahoo news, for example, deletes news articles much quicker than many other sites. So if you add the article as a reference, rather than merely a link, and add it using the guidelines provided in [[WP:CITE]], even if the link is deleted, we still should have author, publication, date, title, and other information regarding the article that you're referring to, so someone using wikipedia for actual research has some sort of 'paper trail' (for lack of a better word) to follow if they want more information. A '404 not found' doesn't really help much here. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 17:49, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:See example. The link has now been added to the article as a reference. Interesting stuff. It probably needs to be used to improve the [[Google platform]] article as well. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 18:13, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

==Mozilla Collaboration?==
I removed this text from the article. A single job posting that makes vague references to 'collaborative efforts with the Mozilla Foundation' that is still posted on the site and unchanged after a year is not really evidence of a notable collaborative effort. While putting Firefox in their Google Pack (software) might be more notable, how many companies include firefox in their software?! I think Google may only be interested as far as the fact that it's a freely available web browser that they can bundle with some of their other products and offer a value, in much the same way Dell might offer it on their computers that they sell. But there is virtually no evidence that Google engineers are partnering with the Mozilla Foundation to further develop new features and functionality in the Firefox browser itself, which is what this text in a way suggests, and why I see it as misleading. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 18:11, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

== Google vs. googol ==

There's a little edit war whether Google is a play on words or a misspelling.

== Google censorship link ==

I performed this revert [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Google&diff=64040187&oldid=64039982] because mention of Google's censorship in China is not appropriate in a lead section paragraph describing the etymology of its name. --[[User:MichaelZimmer|MichaelZimmer]] ([[User talk:MichaelZimmer|talk]]) 00:30, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
:I don't want to get into a revert-war with an anon IP, but this edit should be reverted: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Google&diff=64041366&oldid=64040187]. This is just one social/cultural/political issue of dozens that one could potentially accuse Google of involvement in. While I do agree that this is an important issue (just read my blog), I don't think it should be singled out in the introductory section of an encyclopedia article about the company. --[[User:MichaelZimmer|MichaelZimmer]] ([[User talk:MichaelZimmer|talk]]) 02:53, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

:As other users have pointed out in this discussion page (vid. supra anon user: 'I came to this page specifically to read about the Google/China situation, and was disappointed when I couldn't find it') and as shown by the fact that users keep adding the issue on the main Google page, the China censorship issue is a major aspect of what Google is and has done as a company. In this sense, I deeply believe it belongs in the introduction of the main page. It is factitious to dismiss it it as merely another criticism to add to the list. When the decision was made by Google in January 2006, major main-stream media (e.g. BBC) covered the news and it is fair to say it was a scandal. The company's shares plummeted, and it is widely accepted that Google went through one of its worst weeks ever. 

:I find it very dodgy that a few people have been consistently hiding this under the carpet on this wiki page for the last few months (withdrawing not only the information itself but even removing links!), despite the large number of attempts from different users to express the issue and give it the relevance that most of the world believes it deserves. I think that it is only fair that this page expresses the views and concerns of most people regarding the subject it addresses, rather than becoming a cheesy leaflet by and for Google.

::I don't think its fair to say criticisms of Google are being "hidden under the carpet" or that this article is just a "cheesy leaflet by and for Google."

--[[User:Spet1363|Spet1363]] 16:36, 16 July 2006 (UTC) Apologies if I came across as rude, I do appretiate everybody's efforts. I would agree if there was a brief mention in the introduction (something along the lines of 'which came along with controversy regarding censorship' appended  to the 'new Chinese name' sentence, which seems to me the more logical location), linked to the relevant 'controversy' or 'History' section. This way different issues will not get mixed up and, at the same time, all aspects will receive the fair attention they deserve and all users wanting to consult this important aspect of the company can do so without impediments. --[[User:Spet1363|Spet1363]] 16:36, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

I removed the google censorship information from the paragraph that deals with discussion on the naming of the company, since these are TWO TOTALLY UNRELATED TOPICS, and the BBC News reference that was used to cite this does not even suggest that they are related. It's not correct to even try and tie these together! I don't think we're brushing the censorship issue under the rug at all, since it is covered in great detail in the [[History of Google]] article. But we also don't want the article to become a haven for all the conspiracy theorists trying to make stuff up, either! [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 22:55, 16 July 2006 (UTC)


With all due respect, referring to Google's censorship in China as a conspiracy theory is pretty bold. The reason I believe this important aspect of the company's history belongs where it is now (i.e. in the first chapter) is because that is obviously NOT simply a chapter about the company's name, as you well know-- that is the introduction, where the principal issues are outlined before more in-depth aspects are addressed in the main body. The reason the phrase is appended to the company's Chinese name is because it is a perfectly logical flow from one connected point to another. 

As expressed ad nauseam by me and many, MANY other wikipedia users (whose contributions and their result are plain to see from the page's history), Google's censorship in China is a very imporant issue that people want to read and write about. The issue deserves a predominant location rather than being hidden into some obscure section, four clicks away, in purposely ambiguous wording. As I said in my last post (hoping to get somewhere), I understand some contributors might be concerned about keeping the article concice and to the point; that is why I would be happy to append a short comment to the 'Chinese name' phrase and link that (directly) to a relevant section of the page where the details are objectively laid out more in-depth. --[[User:Spet1363|Spet1363]] 23:16, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
:This article, and all of our other daughter articles concerning Google, should ideally contain nothing but important facts. Many editors seem to be concerned that you are the only one really arguing that the "Google censors content in China" issue is at all logically connected to the end of a paragraph about the name of Google. Just because both have the words "Google" and "China" in them doesn't mean it makes editorial sense to put them next to each other. ([[User:ESkog|ESkog]])<sup>([[User talk:ESkog|Talk]])</sup> 23:24, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

I am ready to accept that the location of the insertion might not be the best. I am not ready to accept that Google's celf-censorship in China is anything but VERY important though. I believe that information deserves to be added to the introduction, in acknowledgement of its relevance and the interest expressed by many Wikipedia users. I would be happy to include it in a different form in a different location, as long as it features in the introduction, where the principal relevant points are outlined. Maybe a few lines could be added between the 'Chinese name' and the 'Server farm' paragraphs (as a new paragraph)? --[[User:Spet1363|Spet1363]] 23:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
:Yes, the issue of censorship in China ''is'' important. But I think that Google's privacy issues are equally important. And someone else might be most concerned with their AdSense policies, or click fraud. Point being, not ''all'' of these belong in the lead section which is meant to summarize the company. Note that [[Yahoo]] doesn't cover equally vital issues of their involvement in China in the lead. --[[User:MichaelZimmer|MichaelZimmer]] ([[User talk:MichaelZimmer|talk]]) 00:01, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

:Please do not add the censorship stuff until further discussion takes place on the talk page. This appears to be quite controversial and only seems to be going in the direction of an edit/revert war. Anyway, on another note, it's interesting to note that the wikipedia entry for [[Pinyin]] doesn't even mention google at all, further pointing to the fact that the two topics are totally unrelated.
:I also still am not buying the argument that the google censorship issue is important enough to mention in the main paragraph. Yes, it's an issue, and is causing some problems. But let's look at things today. What are the top news articles that are in the mainstream media right now? Is google censorship in china one of them? Not hardly! Right now, they're talking about some sort of WAR in Lebanon and missiles in North Korea! The last time google really came up was talking about their new service GBuy, and I can think of quite a few other new products and developments that came to the forefront of the news regarding google before the censorship in china thing. I'm not saying that the issue of Google in China isn't an issue; I'm just saying that it's probably not quite as important as some people think, and not important enough to mention in the opening paragraph. If you still want to argue this, then I would suggest reading [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox|this]] guideline first. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 00:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

::The entire point of my argument is that the China censorship is not just 'another criticism' to add to the list.

Google's shares plummeted at the time (there is no denying that [http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article342636.ece]-- the fact they have recovered six months later is inconsequential; the US recovered after the Great Depression and that does not imply it was irrelevant or did not exist), there was enormous media coverage at the time (exemplified by the BBC article I keep adding and you keep deleting under the false pretense of believing someone is attempting to make a reference to some etymological issue), and, as Igloolily pointed out, MANY Wikipedia users believe it is an important issue that deserves mention. You obviously found a good reason to delete their contributions in pretty much every single occasion.

So, if censorship in China is so important to be included in opening paragraph of the article, then why isn't censorship of nazi and arian related sites by Germany and France not included here? Even Yahoo! has had to deal with criticisms like this, but the fact is, that Germany and France have very strict rules regarding this type of material, and if you want to do business there, you have to follow those rules. Of course, China is no different in this case -- they just appear that way because they're a communist country and the communist regime is under criticism here (in the same way Germany and France have been criticized). Google (and Yahoo) just want to do business in these areas, so they got to follow the rules. So is this really a google controversy, or is this really more a controversy with the governments? [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 22:38, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
:IMO, there are ''all'' controversies with those particular governments first, and issues with Google's cooperation second. As such, it is not appropriate either from a neutrality standpoint, nor a style standpoint, to isolate just ''one'' of Google's questionable policies in the lead. Now, 129 and others, don't get me wrong: I think the Google & China issue is major (again, just read my blog), but this is an encyclopedia, and the introductory paragraphs on an article about Google is ''not'' the place to focus attention on just one of the various controversies. --[[User:MichaelZimmer|MichaelZimmer]] ([[User talk:MichaelZimmer|talk]]) 23:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

We were making some progress with the new subsection, and that was unilaterally deleted by Dr Cash (who has deleted all previous entries referring to the Chinese censorship for the last few months in whichever format and location, as pointed out by Igloolily). It is very hard to assume any objectivity (let alone good will) in those actions, which go very much against the spirit of Wikipedia (and indeed one of Google's ten points-- democracy on the Internet works).

:::While wikipedia encourages all editors to be [[WP:BOLD|bold]] in editing articles, if what you add to the article is reverted by someone else, the [[WP:CONSENSUS|consensus]] guideline does not tell you to start an edit war over it by reverting the reversion! Consensus means using the talk page to come to an agreement regarding your addition or material that you've added BEFORE directly adding it! But you seem to think it's the other way around: add what you want added and then debate it's validity on the talk page and meanwhile keep reverting anyone that takes what you want added out.

== 3RR concerns ==

It appears to me that there may be a case of gaming the system by using both a logged-on identity and an anonymous IP to reinsert the same material; I am not convinced that {{userlinks|Spet1363}} and {{userlinks|129.67.89.102}} are different people. Multiple times the reverter has changed just in time to avoid that 4th revert. However, I don't think it's time to bother the checkuser folks with it just yet.

Also consider this a reminder to all involved parties that:
#you should always be careful not to revert the same article four times in 24 hours, to avoid breaking the [[WP:3RR|three-revert rule]]
#there is precedent for everyone involved in a long-sitting edit war to be blocked even absent violations of the 3RR, although this is usually reserved for cases in which discussion is not present.

I'll try to slow down the blind reverting if everyone else will too, although it remains my position that consensus strongly favors not including this piece of information in the introduction. ([[User:ESkog|ESkog]])<sup>([[User talk:ESkog|Talk]])</sup> 23:05, 17 July 2006 (UTC)


::I find it hard to progress when certain users will blindly delete any hint of criticism to the company regardless of who it comes from, where it is placed, and how it is worded. I am not going to conceal the fact that 129(...) and spet1363 are the same (I never intended to make it a secret). I also agree that an edit war is in nobody's interest and am willing to reduce the blind reverting, as long as there is some hint of progress (e.g. not unilaterally blasting the foundations of modifications that lead towards the establishment of a middle ground, such as the 'Criticism' subsection created by Michael Zimmer).

== China Straw Poll ==

Let's try a [[WP:STRAW|straw poll]] to help arrive at consensus.

''Please sign your name using four tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>) under the position you support, preferably adding a brief comment. If you are happy with more than one possibility, you may wish to sign your names to more than one place. Extended commentary should be placed below, in the section marked "Discussion", though brief commentary can be interspersed.''

'''Question''': Should the introductory section include specific mention of Google's censorship of results in China in relation the naming of its Chinese search product?

* Yes
** '''Support''' I think it is important enough to be mentioned in the intro, because it is the most controversial issue about the company, and the rest of the article reads like an advert. We're supposed to be balanced, not cheerleading.  If you look at [[WP:LEAD]], the lead section is supposed to include "a mention of its notable controversies, if there are any." [[User:Publicola|Publicola]] 05:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)


* No
**'''Oppose''' - Issue is important, but should not be singled out in introductory paragraph. [[Google#Controversies]] section is sufficient to mention, and point readers to additional details. --[[User:MichaelZimmer|MichaelZimmer]] ([[User talk:MichaelZimmer|talk]]) 14:59, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

=== Discussion ===
''Discussion resulting from the survey should go here.''

The issue WAS whether it belonged in the intro or not, but, as I have repeatd ad nauseam, I am willing to compromise. The creation of a subsection about controversies was a great start, but that was unilaterally removed under the justification that 'contrary to popular believe it is not important' and 'it will invite conspiracy theorists to write junk'. Not a positive attitude! As ever, I am still waiting for constructive feedback that will lead to the establishment of a consensual middle ground. 'Shut up and leave our article the way it was' is not a consensual middle ground. People need to be able to find the Chinese censorship issue easily, read and write about it without the impediments created by a few users. --[[User:Spet1363|Spet1363]] 15:05, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
:Um, the section was not removed: [[Google#Controversies]]--[[User:MichaelZimmer|MichaelZimmer]] ([[User talk:MichaelZimmer|talk]]) 15:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:I am against this poll, not because I want to be difficult for the sake of it, but for two important reasons: 

:1. As the article about straw polls mentions, Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy, the way to solve disagreement is by arriving at consensus (i.e. a compromise on EVERYBODY's part), not raising your hand and counting. 

:And 2, it presents a black and white case. I originally defended the idea of including an explicit mention on the intro, but I have listened to what others have to say and am now willing to accept different options, such as a simple link from the intro to the relevant section (as long as that section exists and is objective and balanced in the first place). This is not an all or nothing situation. I am keenly awaiting for moves in the right direction, rather than obstinate attitudes. Are we going to start working towards agreeing, or are we going to carry on with this for much longer? --[[User:Spet1363|Spet1363]] 15:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:I think the new controversies subsection is fair, objective and is a good compromise.

I removed the link references from the introductory section, since the BBC article link was made in the sentence referring to the 'pin yin' name, and the reference itself made no mention of that name whatsoever, so is actually misleading. With regards to the other external link reference, that was actually used inappropriately, since it was not really an external link but in fact, an internal link to another part of the article. I removed it also for the reason that I strongly disagree that the china controversy should be mentioned in the opening paragraph, which I think based on the 'straw poll' above, most everyone agrees with that. As far as the 'controversies' section itself, I can live with that section, though I am still a bit cautious as I think it's really just going to be a big red target for conspiracy theorists to add junk and vandalize. We're going to have to watch that very carefully. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 18:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I added the links again because the etymology excuse is something we have already argued about extensively here. The introduction is obviously not a place were etymology is discussed.

Just adhering to the same (dubious) justification over and over again.

As a Google fan, I've watched this conflict unfold for several days, but have not participated because I was considering leaving Wikipedia. Since I've decided not to leave, and am looking for WikiProjects and more ways to participate and contribute information, I feel compelled to give my input.

The introductory paragraphs are meant to be a summary of Google. They should describe the most notable information on Google. Google is notable for its innovative, clean products and impact on online culture. However, is Google notable for going into China and its censorship? No. Why? When I say "Google", people will be more likely to think about the former, not the censorship.

Therefore, I don't think Google's Chinese name even deserves mention in the introduction. It's not something notable about Google. If the Chinese name was not in the introduction, I suspect this conflict would have never started.

I think the censorship issue and Chinese name definitely deserve mention, but not in the introductory section. It can surely fit into another section of the article. I generally have a tendency to assume bad faith about anonymous editors, but if he persists, I suggest the following compromise in the introduction.

"Google has become well known for its innovative, clean products, and has a major impact on online culture. However, the corporation has been criticized for privacy concerns and its censorship of searches in various countries."

P.S. MSN, AOL, Lycos, Yahoo! and most other search engines, including Baidu, also censor search results in China. Why is Google blamed the most? Because it's the largest search engine, or because it does no evil? Please mention the fact that other search engines also censor searches, That is a fact that many overlook, and should be included in the article.

:[[User:Hildanknight|J.L.W.S. The Special One]] has a point - we don't mention any of Google's other non-U.S. properties; why single out the Chinese one in the introduction?

:::The issues isn't just the singling out of China, but the mention of one (or two) particularly controversial topics. Your attempt at "settling" introduced the notion that it is best to now mention censorship and privacy ''generally'' in the introduction. That's no better: why these two issues? Why not clickspam? Bias in ranking? Adsense practices? The point here (which I thought we ''had'' settled) is that the introduction should be a brief summary of what the company ''is'' and not try to address (selectively) the multiple controversies the company might be embroiled in.

I just thought my edit was a middle ground between the person who wanted the Chinese censorship controversy included, and the rest of us. However, since you've settled the issue, I don't think I should get involved. However, I still think the Chinese name should not be included in the introduction. The singling out of China was what provoked someone to include the Chinese censorship controversy in the introduction.

This video seems to keep being inserted as a reference for the statement about 50% of new product launches coming from 20% time:

:[http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/courses/msande472/060517-msande472-300.asx]

The problem I have with it is, is that it's allegedly a video of a course lecture at stanford university and not published in any professional media sources. The video link alone is not acceptable, as stanford is likely to delete the video soon after the course completes, and then we're stuck with a link to something that doesn't exist. So I think we really need to find a more acceptable source here. Something that is also a text-based source that we can read, and don't have to depend on our PCs ability to play windows media player files to verify the source.

We've already got a screenshot of the main page earlier in the article, and what does this specific image have to do with the 'growth' of google? I'm not so sure this is necessary.

Google just anounced a new product ['''Google Apps for your Domain''']. I don't know much about it my self, but we should try to get some information up about it as soon as possible

:'''Google Apps for your Domain''' has now been added.

: But, about the new Google apps in 2006 -- there are many more that were lunched this year, besides Calendar and GAfyD.  [[Google Spreadsheets|Spreadsheets]] and [[Google Notebook|Notebook]] are the most notable ones, IMO. Search for "2006" in [[List of Google services and tools]] for the rest.

this definition was supplied as part of the Defence in a trademark dispute between Google Inc v Dot Name Communications [http://www.arbforum.com/domains/decisions/114712.htm] maybe contacting [http://www.lords.org Lords] (very old UK cricket organisation) would clarify this word definition

===Googleplex word origin===
Also, from the first book of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy¹ ([[1979]]), chapter 25, page 127, the correct spelling (rather than the number googol) is also found in the correct context:

''"And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a greater analyst than the '''Googleplex''' Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?" ''

[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/google]. As for where to move the company article, either would be acceptable, but [[Google, Inc.]] would be my fav.  As for the claim that it is unusual to include "Inc" in the article title, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Inc&fulltext=Search this] seems to indicate otherwise. [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Gateway, Inc.]], [[Manpower Inc.]], [[TSR, Inc.]], etc. are all located at Inc when their shortened name is ambiguous. --[[User:Bobblehead|Bobblehead]] 23:15, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Strong oppose''' &ndash; Putting 'Google Inc.' in the title does not conform to examples of other corporate articles. For example, [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], and even [[Wal-Mart]], do not have the 'Inc.' in the title/URL. However, it should be noted that the first line of each article does start with '''Microsoft Corporation''', '''International Business Machines Corporation''', and '''Wal-Mart, Inc.''', respectively. I don't see a valid reason for the Google article breaking with this. [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 00:39, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' - [[Google]] is the main topic article for several sub-topics, including [[Google search]]. Moving [[Google search]] here because most people refer to it as "Google" makes about as much sense as moving [[George W. Bush]] to [[President]]. <span style="color: #F06A0F">&ndash;</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F">[[User:Anþony|'''<span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F"> &nbsp;Anþony&nbsp;</span>''']][[User talk:Anþony|<span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&nbsp;talk&nbsp;</span>]]</span></small> 00:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Strong oppose''' As mentioned in previous, by adding Inc, it may effect efficiancy in search capabilities as most user's search the least amount of words associated because often using other words directly effects the once narrowness of the search, by widening it, many new people join the internet everyday, and requiring specific info will only hinder the search, best to just leave it alone as is, after all one can just simply add the Inc as hyper links as most pages contain, linking both to the definition and history of Inc, and alast Google association with Inc,is divided and seperate. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Fredflinstoned|Fredflinstoned]] ([[User talk:Fredflinstoned|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fredflinstoned|contribs]]){{#if:19:12, December 12, 2006 (UTC)|&#32;19:12, December 12, 2006 (UTC)|}}.</small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

* '''Strong oppose'''. The word Google (not Google Inc.) has become synonymous with everyone, so the article title should stay the same.

===Discussion===
:''Add any additional comments:
So far several of the opposes are citing faulty reasons.  They are simply incorrect that the use of the company's "proper" name is uncommon within Wikipedia.  It is very common to use the "proper" name when the name has uses other than the company's name. Apple is located at [[Apple Computers]], palm is located at [[Palm, Inc.]], Coca-Cola is located at [[The Coca-Cola Company]], Pepsi is located at [[PepsiCo]], etc. I think [[Pepsi]] and [[Coca-Cola]] are the best and most applicable examples in this case.  Both companies have a product named after the company and in both cases the product (the most common use of the name) is the one that is at the name, while the company is located at the company's "proper" name. --[[User:Bobblehead|Bobblehead]] 04:41, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I '''agree''' with Bobblehead's points above, that those examples are the best treatment, and that Google should be moved to match (I propose [[Google (company)]] as the article title to be used), consitent with WP:STYLE.  However, there are many, many other cases that need to be changed/split as well: [[eBay]], [[Priceline]], etc. [[User:68.173.35.116|68.173.35.116]] 20:39, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

Just wanted to know whats up with the google logo, I understand certain times of the year google changes their logo on their home page durring certain holidays and festivities such as olympic competitions and etc, but has anyone noticed the current google logo, what has that got to do with anything, it looks more like an excerpt out of the holocaust, or the rendention of the end of days, anyone know whats up with the logo, do they randomly choose it, or did it take a company wide vote to decide to place it on their home page, hey while on the topic, it would be cool if google allowed users to submit their tasteful art on their homepage for veiwing, if anything they could do it for the arts.

==Article Size: Possible Solutions==
The Google article is now over 31 kb in length. To solve this problem, I think we can improve its structure. If you look at the History section, it has several sub-sections, yet they all lead to the same article. Perhaps the History section can be a concise summary, leading onto the main History of Google article. At the moment, it almost seems pointless having a separate article... it just needs to be used more.

--[[User:MamboJambo|Mambo Jambo]] 18:38, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:31 kb is hardly anything to worry about. I've seen articles well above that, some of which are even featured articles. Seeing as how most people are using broadband these days, why are you worried about 31 kb? [[User:Derek.cashman|Dr. Cash]] 19:40, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

==The company was incorporated "at a friend's garage?"==
"The domain google.com was registered on September 14, 1997, and the company was incorporated as Google Inc. on September 7, 1998 at a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California."

One does not incorporate their company (or register a domain name for that matter) at their place of business. One files for incorporation, and if they do it at any place it would be a corporate filing office. See [[Incorporation (business)]]. Perhaps they used the address of the property (referred to as a garage) as their principal place of business? If so, that's what should be said, because it makes a hell of a lot more sense than "Google was incorporated at a friend's garage."

==A Monopoly?  Or Quickly Becoming One?==
It seems that we should be increasingly worried nowadays given that Google is BY FAR the world's largest search engine, with no other company/competitor even coming remotely close to matching Google's unabashed dominance on the Internet (though some European companies are currently working on viable alternatives). Google also has customized search sites in dozens of languages and tailored to dozens of countries (google.de, google.fr, google.ru, google.cn, google.it, the list goes on and on -- strangely enough though, the Japanese Google is google.CO.jp…CO for COMPANY, as in google.[COM]pany in the U.S.), and I assume that they are largely dominant in those 'markets' as they are in the USA.

Even Google's supposed "competitors" all now seem to be 'enhanced by' or 'powered by' Google (as shown by the nifty little badge located to the right of so many search engines these days), thus making them nothing more than Google clones; who knows how many smaller search engines have now been swallowed by the ‘Googlith.’  I won’t be surprised if even Wikipedia's in-house search engine doesn't soon become 'enhanced by' Google. How has Google managed to transform the browsing of the Internet in to a business (one of the world's largest and most obscenely profitable) given that it didn't begin that way?  Do the words "Internet" and "business" even belong together in the same sentence when we web surfers aren't even trying to buy anything 99% of the time that we are using Google?  Shouldn’t it be google.ORG instead of google.COM; or maybe google.cor might be best, since Google is technically now a corporation and is thus “publicly held,” though we all of course know that this is indeed not the case given the price of the site’s shares.

Doesn't this trend (the 'Googlization' of other search engines on the web) worry anyone else, especially governmental agencies, law firms, colleges/universities, scholars/researchers, etc.?  Doesn't Google's ''undisputed'' pre-eminence on the Internet actually ''threaten'' the free-flow of information or ''impede'' the so-called 'marketplace of ideas,' (given that Google IS truly nothing more than an electronic marketplace/business that also happens to be the world's largest search engine: raking in BILLIONS upon BILLIONS of dollars a year on ads that people hardly pay attention to, much less click on). I thought that capitalism (remember: Google is still overwhelmingly a privately held company) required competition; however, it's clear that Google currently HAS no competition. This is why it seems that it is now a blatant monopoly (which is against American law) and, when it comes to the Internet especially, this could be a bit dangerous or 'shady' if you know what I mean.  Does anyone else agree? Where are the anti-trust lawyers when you need them?!

In fact (I'm not insinuating that they do this) but the people at Google could '''''EASILY''''' block and/or erase very controversial or 'socially threatening' sites from its servers that it doesn't want the world to see or notice, i.e. websites that some might deem threatening to the 'social order,' sites with instructions on how to make weapons, sites with information on notoriously reclusive yet very powerful people/groups, and so forth.  Or they could just as easily bury these ‘controversial search results’ on the 999th page of results that no one will obviously ever reach, thus keeping them very-very low in the results even if they contain highly relevant and useful information (even if these ‘Google-hidden’ sites are indeed 'controversial' or considered 'socially dangerous' it doesn’t mean that they do not deserve to be placed much higher in the results, that they aren't aren't valid and useful and deserve to be seen).

Is anyone else disturbed by this trend of Google utterly monopolizing the free-flow of ideas on the web?  Controlling (or directing us to) the websites we see because we rarely if ever go past the 5th or 6th page of search results when looking things up?  In a truly free and open society, shouldn't the ''entirety'' of the Internet be run by and for the PUBLIC GOOD with no centralized locus (Google is obviously now the Internet's hub, or locus); shouldn't the Internet be made fully ''transparent'' and a public service rather than having about a certain 10,000 Silicon Valley employees in a totally private and closed-off "[[Googleplex]]" manage and sort the information of the world, all the while reaping amazingly ridiculous profits for billions of tiny ads, most of which are largely ignored?  So, do you all think that Google is a monopoly (or quickly becoming one) and/or a threat to the freedom of information on the Internet?  --[[User:Pseudothyrum|Pseudothyrum]] 10:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

==Recent Changes to Article Summary==
Recently, the article's summary section has been dramatically increased in size and wording. I'm not certain on who made these changes, but I feel that it could hinder the nomination for being a featured article. There are also other changes that really need to be made to this article, because recently things have been unnecessarily edited, leaving just a bigger mess.

Does anyone else see the motive in me re-editing the changes to the summary section? Thanks. [[User:MamboJambo|Mambo Jambo]] 16:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

==Enterprise products==
Currently:
<blockquote>
In 2007, Google launched Google Apps Premium Edition, a software suite for businesses that provides e-mail, instant messaging, calendar, word processing, as well as a spreadsheet program.[43] This product is targeted primarily at the business user, and intended to compete directly versus Microsoft's Office suite, with a price of approximately $50 per user per year compared to $500 per user for Microsoft Office.[43]
</blockquote>
This section needs to be re-done.  "Docs and Spreadsheets" needs to be mentioned in the previous section about Applications and not here (they're available without the Apps Premium Edition); this service does not compete with MS Office (even "Docs and Spreadsheets" don't really compete with it).  And there's nothing approximate about $50 per user per year fee. -[[User:Olegos|Olegos]] 23:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

''Google Inc. is developing its own mobile phone, according to industry insiders and analysts, while a Google official in Spain last week acknowledged the company is "investigating" such a project.''

Google isn't commenting directly on leaks from Europe and the United
States which describe a low-cost, Internet-connected phone with a
color, wide-screen design. Newspaper and blog reports in recent months have Google shopping its phone design to potential mobile phone manufacturing partners in Asia.For more on the subject visit :http://www.webdesigningcompany.net "Mobile is an important area for Google," Google spokeswoman Erin Fors said on Friday. "We remain focused on creating applications and
establishing and growing partnerships with industry leaders to develop innovative services for users worldwide. However, we have nothing further to announce."

Gadget enthusiasts who only two months ago were obsessed with the
potential revolutionary impact on the phone industry of Apple Inc.'s
iPhone device -- due out in June and at prices starting at $500 --
have shifted their attention to whether Google is developing an even
lower-cost phone.

Newest Google guffaw: High-speed Internet through your toilet
By Associated Press

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Presiding over a company with a market value of
$143 billion apparently gives Silicon Valley's most famous
billionaires a good sense of humor -- and a case of corporate potty
mouth.

Senior executives at Google Inc. launched their annual April Fools'
Day prank Sunday, posting a link on the company's home page to a site
offering consumers free high-speed wireless Internet through their
home plumbing systems.

Code-named ''Dark Porcelain,'' Google said its ''Toilet Internet
Service Provider'' (TiSP) works with Microsoft Corp.'s new Windows
Vista operating system. But sorry -- septic tanks are incompatible
with the system's requirements.

The gag included a mock press release quoting Google co-founder and
president Larry Page, a step-by-step online installation manual, and a scatological selection of Frequently Asked Questions. On some Google sites, the company's official logo -- a lticolored ''Google'' that changes according to the season and on holidays -- substituted a
commode for the second ''g.'' ''There's actually a thriving little underground community that's been studying this exact solution for a long time,'' Page said in the facetious statement. ''And today our Toilet ISP team is pleased to be leading the way through the sewers, up out of your toilet and -- splat -- right onto your PC.''
Marissa Mayer, a Google vice president, called TiSP a ''breakthrough
product, particularly for those users who, like Larry himself, do much of their best thinking in the bathroom.''
TiSP is the latest April Fools joke at the Mountain View, Calif.-based company, where hijinks pervade cubicles all year long. In blogs, Google employees joke about the recent injection of green dye into milk in the cafeteria, while another talks about zany underlings
filling the vice president of engineering's office with sand.
Visit me at http://www.webdesigningcompany.net. Anyway Eric Raymond, a software developer in Malvern, Pa., and author of the New Hacker's Dictionary, said TiSP nailed several important tenets of hacker humor.

The concept of free wireless access parallels a legitimate, four-year
deal between Google and EarthLink Inc. to provide free wireless
Internet service throughout San Francisco starting in early 2008.

As part of the spoof, Google said TiSP would be offered in three
speeds: Trickle, The No. 2, and Royal Flush.

''The leitmotif of hacker humor is precise reasoning from utterly
bizarre premises, and once you're in that groove, you're absolutely
fearless about going deeper,'' Raymond said. ''We also have a tendency to deliberately zigzag between highly intellectual humor and utter slapstick. The more zigzags you can manage in a single spoof, the funnier it is.'' <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Charlesmartinn|Charlesmartinn]] ([[User talk:Charlesmartinn|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Charlesmartinn|contribs]]) 05:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->

==Web Hosting==

I personally don't think that searching for "google" on wikipedia should take you to the article on google.com. I think that the word "google" is actually a mathematical term. Let's not help propogate stupidity on the internet, but rather keep things clear. And no, I'm not signing my post. That's totally uneccessary and needs to be omited from the wikipedia discussion procedure. It doesn't cut down on anything.

The statement that all Google Earth images can be found elsewhere should be removed or modified, since the images on Street View are unique to Google Earth. [[User:70.118.225.241|70.118.225.241]] 09:15, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

==Google caving in to the demands of some groups==
There's nothing in the article about Google's history of giving in to the demands of some groups.  The Church of Scientology demanded that they demote anti-Scientology websites in favour of the official ones.  George W. Bush demanded that a site critical of his policies be demoted on searches for the phrase "dumb motherfucker".  China demanded that Google remove links to sites appearing in searches about "freedom" or "democracy".  Google has consistently acquiesced to the demands of these groups and others.  --[[User:Darth Borehd|Darth Borehd]] 23:13, 15 September 2007 (UTC)

==Google Picks political sides?==
I propose to add this to Criticisms section of the Google page.

In Oct, 2007, Google is accused of taking sides with liberal organization MoveOn by working with them to prevent anti MoveOn ads from appearing on Google's adwords. Google's public council gave the reason as enforcement of trademarks [http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/], but has been criticized by several bloggers. [http://gigaom.com/2007/10/12/google-banning-anti-moveonorg-ads/]

In addition, Democratic leader Al Gore is one of the key influencers of Google's early day decisions. [http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/117/features-gore.html] [[User:TwakTwik|TwakTwik]] 16:44, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

:The Al Gore information could be interesting, and could possibly be integrated into the history section.

The Google.org subsection was not deleted from the article, it was moved and rewritten to a subsection under history, entitled 'Philanthropy'.

The Google.mobi section was deleted outright because it was stupid. It was poorly written, and made it look like Google was the main proponent behind this new TLD, which is bull. It's not a significant part of the company, and nobody is even using .mobi domains anyway. This section violates [[WP:NPOV]] and has been removed.

==Google IPO price==
"Google's initial public offering took place on August 19, 2004. 19,605,052 shares were offered at a price of $200 per share.[25]"
<br><br />
I believe the offering price was $85 per share.  The cited article [25] only mentions the offering price range.  Oddly, the next sentence is correct, and the next cited article [26] clearly states the offering price was $85. Multiply total shares: 19,605,505 x $85/share = 1.67 billion.  <br /><br />
"Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as √2 ≈ 1.4142135) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders. The sale raised $1.67 billion, and gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[26]"<br /><br />
The "History of Google" article has the same content but with correct price-per-share amount.

A more authoritative source for IPO information would be:<br><br>

Currently Google Earth is mentioned in the 'Applications' section as an application developed by Google.
The origin of Google Earth is in a product developed by Keyhole ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole%2C_Inc.]).
Keyhole was acquired by Google in 2004 (another missing fact in the article).
Keyhole's product had the base functionality of Google Earth still as a product of Keyhole - taking this in mind, I think it would be more appropriate to be placed in the acquisition paragraph as not to mislead people to think it was actually crated by Google.

The intro is supposed to be a '''summary''', summarizing information that should later appear in the article, and the 'citation needed' tags that you added were totally unnecessary. This particular sentence doesn't need a citation because (a) the "don't be evil" philosophy is covered and cited in other areas of the article, and the criticisms are also covered in a well cited 'criticisms' section.

==Google moved HQ to Switzerland==
Google your way to a wacky office.
If your ideal workspace includes a slide, a games room, a 'chill-out' aquarium and plenty of free food then you had better get your CV into Google. Dotcom companies were defined by beanbags and pizza but Google, a company that came to prominence after the bubble had burst, has taken that image to a whole new level. Meeting 'pods' in the style of Swiss chalets and igloos, fireman poles to allow easy access between floors and a slide to ensure that people can get to the cafeteria as quickly as possible are all part of a design of its new European engineering headquarters in Zurich Switzerland. The building was designed for - and partly by - the 300 engineers who will work there. They are best served, according to the vice president of engineering, by both a creative work environment and a flat, open working structure. The wacky office is both a showcase for Google's unconventional approach to business and a symbol to prove that Google is no longer a US-centric firm.

<blockquote>
Google's cooperation with the governments of China, and to a lesser extent France and Germany (regarding Holocaust denial) to filter search results in accordance to regional laws and regulations has led to claims of censorship.

I was under the impression that Google had removed pages discussing the holocaust (and was thus denying the holocaust, since that seems like a more legitimate criticism), when they were actually '''removing''' pages that are White Nationalist/Neo-Nazi. Perhaps the sentence is worded correctly, but it still reads a little ambiguously. -[[Special:Contributions/98.209.101.146|98.209.101.146]] ([[User talk:98.209.101.146|talk]]) 20:35, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

* No.  Android is, ostensibly, an operating system for mobile devices.  All operating systems must have a native interface into the processor and memory of the device, which means that at le google ast a part of Android must be Google compiled to run on the processor of the device in question.  Android does have one major thing going for it; it's open source which means that anyone can build it for any platform.  But that building process wipanes ll be non-trivial, so if a consumer wants to put Android on their device then some developer will have had to already compile Android's core for that device.  Once this happens, the Android interface on that device will be similar to the Androidgoogle interface on any other device and any application that was programmed to work for Android should work for this device. <span style="font-size:14px;">&mdash; [[User talk:XSG|<span style="background:#808;">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11px;color:#fff;">X</span>&nbsp;</span><span style="background:#f80;">&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11px;color:#fff;">S</span>&nbsp;</span><span style="background:#404;" gooogle >&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11px;color:#fff;">G</span>&nbsp;</span>]]</span> 02:10, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

* And as well as Android being an operating system for mobile devices, Google also had a hand in building the layout for the iPhone operating system. As well as the mobile operating systems, there has been a recent leak about an operating system called Multixe (Mul-ty-cs is the correct pronunciation). Unfortunately, the email I received with information about this supposed operating system for the PC came to me as a spam email, so it is most likely either some kind of scam to get me looking like some kind of idiot or the truth, or just a deliberate lie.

*Also, another item about hacking using Google could be the fact that, using Google, there are many other
places to hack as well. The reason for this is a small glitch in the hexadecimal code within Google's
HTML. Sadly, this means there are plenty of things you are able to get to which breach security measures,
and is therefore classed as hacking. Freewebs websites are sometimes ably hacked by persons who type in
a special code, then search and click a specific link to get to the members area of websites like these.

:2) The lead is too short. It should be at least 3 paragraphs long. The statement that Google is not part of  Dow Jones Industrial Average is not mentioned in the main text.

:3) Please, find substitutes for the two dead links.

:4) The word Google in some references should be unbolded.

:5) Generally, the article is not well structured. There are lots of stubby sections and paragraphs. It may need a thorough copy-edit.

==Comprehensive, but shows the flaw in Wikipedia==
The Google page is lengthy and covers a lot, including that which is quite trivial. This shows the flaw mentioned - that fashionable, 'new', American entities are favoured over less hyped and 'old' entities, something that wouldn't happen in an edited encyclopaedia.

==Market Capitalization updates...==
Placing a "spot price" for the Market Capitalization of an organization like Google doesn't seem to reflect very useful information.  It was > $150B two weeks ago and now it's below $140B, and who knows where it will be tomorrow.

The departure of people in these positions is not inherently notable. -- [[User:Thirteenity|Thirteenity]] ([[User talk:Thirteenity|talk]]) 22:04, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

== "Google" Name ==

While many sources seem to indicate that the "Google" name is a play on the word "Googol" there has been a remarkable paucity of speculation about the influence of two other names which may (also) be sources: "Google" is, of course, the last name of the old comics character Barney Google, who was known - in a famous song from the 20s which lives on to some extent - as "Barney Google, with the goo-goo-googly eyes." The "OO in Google often appears to be a pair of eyes, and there is some suspicion among other people I know that this is one of the sources. The other is Nikolai Gogol, a famous Russian author - among other works, "Diary of a Madman" - and it cannot escape notice that Sergiy Brin is, of course, Russian-born. Further support for this can be noticed in the somewhat unusual "Gogol" logo that appeared in April for Google on Gogol's 200th birthday. See:  http://www.google.com.ua/logos/gogol09.gif

* http://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-adwords-site-targeting-google-now-a-media-company/1621/

I'd like to change the crossed-out portions of this introductory paragraph to this (quoting from the 2004 [[Form 10-K]]):
:'''Google Inc.''' is an American "software, technology, Internet, advertising and media company" headquartered at the [[Googleplex]] in [[Mountain View, California]]. It earns revenue from [[AdWords|advertising]] related to its [[Google search|Internet search]], [[Gmail|e-mail]], [[Google Maps|online mapping]], [[Google Apps|office productivity]], [[Orkut|social networking]], and [[YouTube|video sharing]] services as well as selling advertising-free versions of the [[Google Search Appliance|same technologies]]. {{As of|2009|03|31|df=US}}, the company has 19,786 full-time employees. The company is running thousands of servers worldwide, which process millions of search requests each day and about one petabyte of user-generated data every hour.

== Erroneous, outdated, and incomplete search share information ==

The article reads, "As of August 2007, Google is the most used search engine on the web with a 53.6% market share, ahead of Yahoo! (19.9%) and Bing Search (12.9%).[74]"

But Bing wasn't around in 2007 - it was released in 2009 - and the citation link goes to a "page cannot be found" page.  Clearly, either the date or the data is wrong.

Besides, rather than 2007 figures, we might as well use the current search browser share, anyway (although I don't know whose data Wikipedia would want to use).  Google is in the 70% market share area, from what I can tell from various sources, and Bing has been slipping now that their media blitz is winding down.

Finally, I came to this article looking for Google's year-over-year growth in search share.  If someone would like to put that in there, instead of just having one snapshot date of search share, I think it would be helpful to shed light on the history of Google's growth, especially how it relates to that of Yahoo.  Google came on the scene when Yahoo was dominating the search market, so it's interesting to look at how they slew the giant... and became the giant themselves.  (Or perhaps the search engine market share of all different engines deserves its own topic that all search engine pages refer to.)  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/97.119.189.14|97.119.189.14]] ([[User talk:97.119.189.14|talk]]) 18:01, 29 December 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

[http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2008/01/google-mapreduce-stats.html] says they process over 20 petabytes a day. And [http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-08/mf_googlopoly] is the site that says they do one petabyte an hour, or 24 a day. To make the situation even more confusing, a true petabyte is 10<sup>15</sup> bytes, but in computing they more often use 1024<sup>5</sup> (the correct name for this is a pebibyte, but that name is rarely used). If you take 24 petabytes and calculate it out in pebibytes, it comes to around 21. In other words, all the sources say different things, and we cannot even decipher what a single one of them is saying. As far as I'm concerned, one of the sites that says 20 petabytes a day is Google's internal blog, so I am going with 20.

== Parent5446's lead rewrite... ==

I've done some minor tuning to Parent5446's rewrite/reorg of Google's lead.

My chief concern, presently, is that in the first sentence, it is stated, "'''Google Inc.''' is a [[Multinational|multinational]] [[Public company|public]] [[Cloud computing|cloud computing]] and [[Internet search]] technologies [[corporation]] that hosts and develops [[List of Google products|a number]] of [[Internet]]-based services and products."  We have a second paragraph that goes into details about the variety of products, however I think that Google's product array is so vast, now, that simply leaving out the second paragraph is warranted, and the link to the list of Google's products should be all that is needed.  The only additional information in the second paragraph is that Google makes money principally from advertising, so I'd like to move that up to the first sentence, like this: "'''Google Inc.''' is a [[Multinational|multinational]] [[Public company|public]] [[Cloud computing|cloud computing]] and [[Internet search]] technologies [[corporation]] that hosts and develops [[List of Google products|a number]] of [[Internet]]-based services and products and profits primarily from internet advertising."

:I understand where you're coming from. My only concern is that without the second paragraph the only thing the reader really finds out about Google is that it is a "cloud computing and Internet search" corporation. We should add some type of sentence or description that describes the type of services Google offers, especially considering it is unlikely people will jump over to a completely different article just to find out a general description of the services they offer. But I do agree the second paragraph is a bit long and unnecessary.

== Commas v. Line Breaks ==

Should we have commas or line breaks separating some of the infobox items? This question has come up particularly because of a disagreement between myself and [[User:Tinton5|Tinton5]], with me supporting commas. Generally, I am willing to accept whatever consensus we can reach, but here is my argument. I would first recommend reading over [[User:Twsx/Commas vs. Linebreaks]]. Though it was written with a different subject in mind, many of the points correlate. The first is that the only real argument for line breaks is they look better, which is trivial considering you could just as easily argue commas look nicer. It's all a matter of perspective and what the editor believes looks better. On [[User:Kameejl/Line breaks versus commas]], there are a bunch of arguments for line breaks that I would agree with...if they applied to this article. (Kameejl points out that line breaks make extensive lists easier to read, but we're not talking about extensive lists, just two lines.) Anyway, there is absolutely no consensus on the argument, and really there is not even a right answer. Personally I think it is more natural to use commas in such a short list.

== April Fool hoax about Google changing name to Topeka ==

{editprotected}April 1st 2010 Google changes name to Topeka. Quote from Google website at http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html 
A different kind of company name
4/01/2010 12:01:00 AM
Early last month the mayor of Topeka, Kansas stunned the world by announcing that his city was changing its name to Google. We’ve been wondering ever since how best to honor that moving gesture. Today we are pleased to announce that as of 1AM (Central Daylight Time) April 1st, Google has officially changed our name to Topeka.


We didn’t reach this decision lightly; after all, we had a fair amount of brand equity tied up in our old name. But the more we surfed around (the former) Topeka’s municipal website, the more kinship we felt with this fine city at the edge of the Great Plains.

In fact, Topeka Google Mayor Bill Bunten expressed it best: “Don’t be fooled. Even Google recognizes that all roads lead to Kansas, not just yellow brick ones.”

For 150 years, its fortuitous location at the confluence of the Kansas River and the Oregon Trail has made the city formerly known as Topeka a key jumping-off point to the new world of the West, just as for 150 months the company formerly known as Google has been a key jumping-off point to the new world of the web. When in 1858 a crucial bridge built across the Kansas River was destroyed by flooding mere months later, it was promptly rebuilt — and we too are accustomed to releasing 2.0 versions of software after stormy feedback on our ‘beta’ releases. And just as the town's nickname is "Top City," and the word “topeka” itself derives from a term used by the Kansa and Ioway tribes to refer to “a good place to dig for potatoes,” we’d like to think that our website is one of the web's top places to dig for information.

In the early 20th century, the former Topeka enjoyed a remarkable run of political prominence, gracing the nation with Margaret Hill McCarter, the first woman to address a national political convention (1920, Republican); Charles Curtis, the only Native American ever to serve as vice president (’29 to ‘33, under Herbert Hoover); Carrie Nation, leader of the old temperance movement (and wielder of American history’s most famous hatchet); and, most important, Alfred E. Neuman, arguably the most influential figure to an entire generation of Americans. We couldn’t be happier to add our own chapter to this storied history.

A change this dramatic won’t happen without consequences, perhaps even some disruptions. Here are a few of the thorny issues that we hope everyone in the broader Topeka community will bear in mind as we begin one of the most important transitions in our company’s history:

*Correspondence to both our corporate headquarters and offices around the world should now be addressed to Topeka Inc., but otherwise can be addressed normally.
* Google employees once known as “Googlers” should now be referred to as either “Topekers” or “Topekans,” depending on the result of a board meeting that’s ongoing at this hour. Whatever the outcome, the conclusion is clear: we aren’t in Google anymore.
* Our new product names will take some getting used to. For instance, we’ll have to assure users of Topeka News and Topeka Maps that these services will continue to offer news and local information from across the globe. Topeka Talk, similarly, is an instant messaging product, not, say, a folksy midwestern morning show. And Project Virgle, our co-venture with Richard Branson and Virgin to launch the first permanent human colony on Mars, will henceforth be known as Project Vireka.
* We don’t really know what to tell Oliver Google Kai’s parents, except that, if you ask us, Oliver Topeka Kai would be a charming name for their little boy.
* As our lawyers remind us, branded product names can achieve such popularity as to risk losing their trademark status (see cellophane, zippers, trampolines, et al). So we hope all of you will do your best to remember our new name’s proper usage: 

Finally, we want to be clear that this initiative is a one-shot deal that will have no bearing on which municipalities are chosen to participate in our experimental ultra-high-speed broadband project, to which Google, Kansas has been just one of many communities to apply.

"Google Inc. has been vacuuming up fragments of people's online activities broadcast over public Wi-Fi networks for the past four years... The company said it only recently discovered the problem in response to an inquiry from German regulators.

"... Google characterized its collection of snippets from e-mails and Web surfing done on public Wi-Fi networks as a mistake, and said it has taken steps to avoid a recurrence. About 600 gigabytes of data was taken off of the Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries, including the U.S. Google plans to delete it all as soon as it gains clearance from government authorities.

"None of the information has appeared in Google's search engine or other services, according to Eustace.

"Nevertheless, Google's decision to hold on to the Wi-Fi data until it hears back from regulators shows the company realizes it could face legal repercussions." ~snippets from AP; click the link for full article

== To administartors, from Bug May 29th at 10:29 PM. ==

In subject 81, it claims that 99% of google's revinues are from advertisement. I highly doubt that, as it was actually in 2006. They need to reword that in 2006 99% of Google's revinue. Google might make more money of selling people's information, or sub-contracts which they never talk about. Anyways this is highly inaccurate.

Does anyone know how they work? Advertisement is not their main revinue. At the rate of 1 cent per link, and assuming they click on it 3 times a day, for 1 month. that's about 90 cents. 
Considering the that by the average of 25,000 link clicks (Top 1000) that's only $25 dollars per cite a month. Can anyone explain this phenomenon?

:Google receives over a billion search requests every day.

But web search information "what the people having in minds" is valuable information. Anybody who have some kind of secret (:= info not available to others) may capitalize on leaking it.  The same hold for this website. His owner advertised it may provide a lot o valuable information in his initial adds.

== Google's private network ==

Google has constructed a massive private network that rivals the capacity and size of major carriers. Why isn't there an article or even an entry on this topic? This network has implications for network neutrality, all of google's core business, and the future of carrier rules and policy. It has already been involved in several lawsuits about privacy and ISP law. I am not an IT professional, which is why I am first suggesting someone else write it.

After some disagreement with [[User:Parent5446]], I'll now bring it the discussion page which I should've done last time were it not for his initial phrasing of "unless you mean something different", which I took to be a misinterpretation of my edit.  

@ Parent5446: Do you happen to have a gmail account or are otherwise logged into Google when you search?  I don't have any preferences with them.  As to the definitions posted above the linked results for certain English words, I was told of such a feature several months ago, and have been keeping an eye out for it.  When it finally appeared, I added mention of it here immediately.  I have specifically been using Google Web Search as a dictionary+search for quite some time now.  This is not something I would've missed, as an avid casual user.  As far as a link? try searching at http://www.google.com for "diligence" and then "diligent" in the main page web search bar.  The latter search will produce the result I was reporting on. The former won't.  Note, I did specify the distinction of it being what google classifies as a "web search" and not their "dictionary", nor am I referring to the dictionary sites' results listed in link form.

"Though web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain [[English]] words began appearing above the linked results for web searches. " [[User:Fixblor|Fixblor]] ([[User talk:Fixblor|talk]]) 21:57, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
:Aha! I apologize for disagreeing, but I thought you were talking about something else.

1e100 is a [[Googol]] (1e100 = 1*10^100). Searching "1e100.net" (on google for example) shows that many people have come across this name and were wondering either what it meant or what it was.

{{not done}} The numbers in the article appear to me to be expressed correctly (that is, per [http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html] and [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312510030774/d10k.htm#toc95279_8] they have billions of dollars in revenue, profit, et cetera). It is common for American companies to express such numbers in millions, because the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] requires that format; Google's reports reflect numbers in a large whole number of millions (40''','''497 millions) for this reason, but we express it more conveniently as a smaller number of billions with a fraction (40'''.'''497 billions). There is no contradiction between these numbers; the comma is used as a separator for the digits of a large whole number, and the period is used as a decimal point, and even though some other languages use them differently, they are not interchangeable. <span  style="white-space:nowrap">— [[User:Gavia immer|Gavia immer]] ([[User talk:Gavia immer|talk]])</span> 19:14, 2 August 2010 (UTC)

Recently, [[User:PopMusicBuff|PopMusicBuff]] proposed that [[Google Dashboard]] be merged into [[Google]] (this article). Despite the speedy merge process, I strongly disagree with this merge. Google Dashboard is not exactly a product of Google, i.e. it does not provide a service to the user. Rather it is a type of meta-service created in the light of privacy concerns brought up over Google. With this in mind, I would not recommend merging this article into the Other products section, as was done. If anything, it should go in the Criticism section as a response to their privacy concerns. Furthermore, regardless of which section we decide to merge it into, it only really deserve a sentence or two mention and not much more.

I still don't see why Google Dashboard can't be its own article - it is a product just like many Google products that have their own article.  It needs improvements, like citations, sources, links, etc., but it seems lazy to me to redirect or remove the article rather than improve it.  And even if it doesn't warrent its own article, Dashboard doesn't really fit with the [[Criticism of Google]] article.  It might have been part of Google's response to criticism, but it is not about criticism of Google.  

It would be better off under [[Google#Other products]] if anything.  I also think that a Google products page would be a better way of organizing information about Google's products.  The list is good, but if it was a stand-alone article about all the Google products, the main Google article could give Main article links to the various sections of the Google products article.  Right now, the main Google article provides short, jumbled summaries of products.  Separating them would make it easier to organize information about each product category.

I've just visited Gmail home page today and it says the Privacy Policy has been updated.

== Vulnerability of Network ==

I understand that one of the innovations attributed to Google is advancement of a dispersed model of network computing. Perhaps the article should incorporate a mention of the relative vulnerability of this approach to natural or manmade disaster, such as a series of simultaneous fires affecting Google facilities in various locations around the world. Surely the relative security afforded by Google's method of expansion is matched by their vulnerability to physical damage.

== Wikipedia Ad ==

There is a particularly large ad for donations by Jimmy Wales on this Wikipedia page about Google. Isn't Wikipedia supposed to be ad free? Would not a much smaller begging note have sufficed, especially as many readers and contributors have already donated? Google themselves would probably have been willing to pay for an advert. Perhaps a very small advertisment area on the Wikipedia pages would be acceptable, in order to keep Wikipedia free for all without guilt attached, it is frankly annoying to all who have donated already especially as it is so large.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/62.255.189.186|62.255.189.186]] ([[User talk:62.255.189.186|talk]]) 18:22, 24 November 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:The ad you see is not unique to the Google article but wiki-wide, so nobody here has any control over that. However, to answer your question, a smaller begging note would not have sufficed and they have actually found that since the implementation of the new "advertisement" (I use quotations because it's not really an advertisement) that more people have been donating more money to Wikipedia, which is pretty important since the Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts Wikipedia does not have any other form of significant revenue. Personally, I do find it a little annoying, but I see where they are coming from and do not complain. Unfortunately, I wish it were the case where the Wikimedia Foundation did not even need these ads because they got enough money from voluntary donations on their own, but that is not the case.

== Financial data and tax rate ==

Google is a major corporation and therefore I thought that a section showing its financial data would be useful in this article, as is the case for instance with the article on [[ExxonMobil#Financial data|ExxonMobil]]. I have started to create one but [[User:Gavia immer]] has immediately eliminated it. Why?

Furthermore, in that section I had written a short paragraph on Google's tax rate, which is a hot issue at this moment. My text summarized the main informations provided by the following recent news: {{Cite news 
  | last = Drucker
  | first = Jesse 
  | title = Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Lost to Tax Loopholes

  | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html }} User Gavia immer deleted it claiming that it was "not demonstrating importance". I wonder how such importance is to be demonstrated. Google's [[tax avoidance]] tactics have reportedly made it avoid $3.1 billion in taxes in the last three years. This figure is quite big and important, at least from my humble point of view.

I would like User Gavia immer to express his/her opinion and hopefully undo his/her reversion. I also invite other users to help decide whether the proposed financial information is pertinent in this article.

:In short: 1.)"Tax rates" can be seriously misleading, since not all taxes are income/profit taxes and attempting to synthesize a "rate" out of taxes paid is an interpretive enterprise - though a very common one that you had a source for. 2.) "The reason is that Google paid a tax rate of only 2.4% for all its income generated outside of the U.S. thanks to [[income shifting]] strategies that take advantage of a number of legal loopholes and [[tax haven|tax havens]] like [[Bermuda]]." is pretty questionable verbiage that implies that something dodgy is going on, as opposed to Google just not being any more inclined than you or I are to pay taxes from their earnings; if this material is kept, it must be neutral 3.) There is no context, and probably can't be, to show whether their taxes were actually low or high compared to other corporations with a similar business model, and without this it is just numbers presented with a vague air of condemnation that could just as easily attach to any other numbers 4.) In fact, we rarely cover tax payments in our articles on large corporations, except as one line or so referenced to an annual report, so it's not typical to single out such information. Actually, that's not very short - but there you go. <span  style="white-space:nowrap">— [[User:Gavia immer|Gavia immer]] ([[User talk:Gavia immer|talk]])</span> 04:28, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

::Gavia, thank you for your answer. I will comment on the four issues that you raise and hopefully we will find an agreement on how to edit the article.

::1) In order to avoid confusions when using the concept of "tax rates", I propose to use the precisely-defined concept of "[[effective tax rate]]", which is what is reported by U.S.-listed companies, including Google.
::2) I see your point regarding neutrality, what about the following wording: "The reason is that Google paid a tax rate of only 2.4% for all its income generated outside of the U.S. thanks to [[tax avoidance]] schemes." As clarified in the article [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion]], avoidance refers to legal methods to pay less taxes, while evasion is for the illegal ones. Suggestions welcome.
::3) We could write the following: "In 2009 Google's effective tax rate became the lowest among the top five U.S. information technology companies. Nevertheless, according to Google, its practices are similar to those of other global corporations." Possibly the most objective way of reporting this would be to create a table with the effective tax rates of those top five companies.
::4) Tax avoidance on overseas profits has reached massive proportions in recent years and ignoring it deliberately could be regarded as non-neutrality. The following link provides detailed numbers for Microsoft, a very large tax avoider: [http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/129tn0271.pdf]. In my opinion every article on a large corporation should contain a section of "Financial information" and within it the effective tax rate should be mentioned in the same way as other key figures like income or assets.

:::I see your point [[User:Hispalois|Hispalois]], but the information on effective tax rate really is not notable enough to deserve its own section. If you strongly believe it should be included in the article, then a neutral, two-sentence implementation of the topic should be integrated into one of the current sections. If you take a look at [[Microsoft]], a featured article and also a technology corporation article, there is absolutely no mention of the tax rate, nor does it say anything about it in [[Facebook]]. However, I do not like to follow by example, and this information does seem pertinent. It should probably fit somewhere in the Corporate affairs section. On a side note, it would be helpful if you could find a few more sources on the tax rate other than just that one article. The one source is enough, but I just want to make sure we're getting all sides of the story. — [[User:Parent5446|Parent5446]] [[User talk:Parent5446|☯]] <sup class="plainlinks">([{{fullurl:User talk: Parent5446|action=edit&preload=User:Parent5446/MediaWiki/TalkPageMessage&section=new}} msg] [[Special:Emailuser/Parent5446|email]])</sup> 21:55, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

::::Hi. Probably the best source on Google's tax rate is [http://investor.google.com/pdf/2009_google_annual_report.pdf Google's annual report 2009], p.48.
::::I did look at the article on Microsoft and found it bizarre that a FA contains so little financial information: just a paragraph on the [[Microsoft#Corporate affairs|historical evolution of the stock price]]; no discussion of key figures (income, revenue, assets, cash...); no information about who are the main shareholders... and no reference to the controversy over its tax avoidance ([http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aAKluP7yIwJY],[http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/129tn0271.pdf]).

:::::Hispalois, I think your second suggestion (previous to the one immediately above this) is much improved, especially in replacing slanted language like "loophole" and "tax haven" with "tax avoidance". I still think (and I see Parent5446 has agreed with me above) that devoting too much space to this not a good idea, since it might amount to a non-neutral emphasis. In particular, while quoting Google's rebuttal might seem to focus of balance and neutrality, it also tends to presume that there is prima facie some issue in need of rebuttal. I'm not convinced that there is; nearly everyone believes that they personally ought not to be paying high taxes, but nearly everyone harbors some belief that distant others "deserve" to pay the high taxes that they themselves would never want to pay.

{{outdent}}

Not at all. The existence of a section for a certain piece of information does not determine its inclusion. Even if there was a financial section, which personally I do not think is necessary (will explain), the tax rate would get a one or two sentence mention because there is only one secondary source that argues it is controversial. Otherwise the tax rate is just big business as usual. In fact, this information might be more appropriate in an article on business itself rather than the Google article. Anyway, as for the financial section, if you can really pull together enough important information, then it would make a nice section, but remember that this is the general Google article. Nobody cares about detailed financial statements or statistics. The only information I can think of that would go in such a section is already integrated into the article, such as the tidbit on how 99% of its revenue is advertising. — [[User:Parent5446|Parent5446]] [[User talk:Parent5446|☯]] <sup class="plainlinks">([{{fullurl:User talk: Parent5446|action=edit&preload=User:Parent5446/MediaWiki/TalkPageMessage&section=new}} msg] [[Special:Emailuser/Parent5446|email]])</sup> 01:36, 1 November 2010 (UTC)

== Edit Request: Network Neutrality ==

Lets start with the current entry:

Network neutrality

Google is a noted supporter of network neutrality. According to Google's Guide to Net Neutrality:

Network neutrality is the principle that Internet users should be in control of what content they view
and what applications they use on the Internet. The Internet has operated according to this neutrality
principle since its earliest days... Fundamentally, net neutrality is about equal access to the
Internet. In our view, the broadband carriers should not be permitted to use their market power to
discriminate against competing applications or content. Just as telephone companies are not permitted to
tell consumers who they can call or what they can say, broadband carriers should not be allowed to use
their market power to control activity online.[204]

On February 7, 2006, Vint Cerf, a co-inventor of the Internet Protocol (IP), and current Vice President and "Chief Internet Evangelist" at Google, in testimony before Congress, said, "allowing broadband carriers to control what people see and do online would fundamentally undermine the principles that have made the Internet such a success."


^^
The above information is in my opinion no longer precise, as google has now started to intervene in the functionality of Search Word Suggestions and Instant results. This form of Censorship I think is in direct contradiction with the above statement on Network Neutrality.

This is the Headline from my source which is linked to below. I hope people around the world agree on this, and if there are any more examples on this kind of google censorship. please post them here...

"It’s taken a while, but Google has finally caved in to pressure from the entertainment industries including the MPAA and RIAA. The search engine now actively censors terms including BitTorrent, torrent, utorrent, RapidShare and Megaupload from its instant and autocomplete services. The reactions from affected companies and services are not mild, with BitTorrent Inc., RapidShare and Vodo all speaking out against this act of commercial censorship."

I think that "American Multinational" is not just okay, but more accurate.  Google's roots are American.  Not just by the founders nationalities (Russian-American is American), but also by the first business licences and domain registration.  They have a history leading up to this day that involves them releasing products and services to America first (or and the very least in English first).  It's obvious that Google is a multinational corporation, but it is also obvious they are more American than they are of any other singular country.

In the article it clearly states "Ninety-nine percent of Google's revenue is derived from its advertising programs."

Yet right at the beginning, the description of Google is written as: "Google Inc. is an American multinational public corporation invested in Internet search, cloud computing, and advertising technologies."

It should read "Google Inc. is an American multinational public corporation invested in advertising technologies, Internet search, and cloud computing."

There is no reason I can see that the order would be the way it is now, other than people trying to manipulate perceptions that advertising revenue is not what drives the company.

None of the 5 mentioned initiatives "intend to make all legal documents public and online" from the description given in the reference link. It sounds like their talking about something similar to [[Project Gutenberg ]] who Google did have talks with before going off and starting their own (and in many ways more limited) [[Google Books]]


TLDR: The summation of projects that received money from the Google.org Project 10^100 needs revising to be accurate.

New section: Critisism

Text: It is virtually impossible to get in contact with Google's support. At their support page there is an e-mail link. Sending an e-mail there just gets you an e-mail which says your e-mail will noit be answered. Following the other links on Google's support page, it says you are supposed to be able to e-mail them but clicking that link just gets you back to the main page. after trying everything you will find out all you can do is posty a topic in their forum. and as you can fsee in ref3 often no one answers the thread, certainly no one from Google. Google's support is ranked 518 of 531 (Ref1).

Comment: I think it is a major issue when such a dominant party is impossible to get in contact with even for site administrators and the like. If you search for "contact google hopeless" in google you get no negative hits. If you do the same in Bing you get a bunch. Just pujt a couple of refs below.

== Factual Correction on April Fools ==

I do not have an account and the page is locked, could someone please correct the following:

Factual correction for 2008: (Its ok if you wish to leave the Gmail group joke, but Google's April Fools joke for 2008 was Virgle).

In 2008, Virgin founder Richard Branson and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced on national TV and YouTube they will be leading hundreds of users on one of the grandest adventures in human history: Project Virgle, the first permanent human colony on Mars [http://www.google.com/onceuponatime/virgle/].

In 2009 Google's Research group switches on CADIE world's first "artificial intelligence" tasked-array system. CADIE stand for Cognitive Autoheuristic Distributed-Intelligence Entity and the entity maintain a diary over several days.

== Requests / servers very very wrong! ==

"Google has been estimated to run over one million servers in data centers around the world,[14] and process over one billion search requests"

So that's an average of 1,000 requests per day, per server? I could serve more than that with my phone! (an Android, naturally!). Even if not all those servers are used for web search, it's still way too much of a discrepancy, since searching is presumably Google's main use of server resources. 

One thousand requests is not a lot for a server. One of those figures is surely widely out. Perhaps they're sourced from very different dates?

== Google's "Birthday" ==

So like many things, Google has a number of dates associated with its creation. There is the start of their research project in January 1996, then the founding of the company on September 4th 1998 and then September 27th, which is the date that Google claimed as their own birthday as shown on [[September 27th|Wikipedia's own date page for September 27th]]. Now the September 27th date isn't even shown in this article. So which one is correct? -- [[User:Deltaray|Deltaray]] ([[User talk:Deltaray|talk]]) 16:21, 4 September 2013 (UTC)
:This was discussed previously at [[Talk:Google/Archive_3#Birthday]]. It is still something of a mystery how September 27 became the official birthday.--'''''[[User:ianmacm|<span style="background:#88b;color:#cff;font-variant:small-caps">♦Ian<span style="background:#99c">Ma<span style="background:#aad">c</span></span>M♦</span>]] <sup>[[User_talk:ianmacm|(talk to me)]]</sup>''''' 17:16, 4 September 2013 (UTC)

== Cleanup of article ==

In order to maintain its [[WP:GA|Good Article]] status, the article needs to be strict about various policies:
*[[WP:NOTNEWSPAPER]]. Parts of the article were reading like a scissors and paste trip round the newspaper cuttings library, rather than prose. Despite some trimming, the problem remains. As NOTNEWSPAPER says: " While news coverage can be useful source material for encyclopedic topics, most newsworthy events do not qualify for inclusion. For example, routine news reporting on things like announcements, sports, or celebrities is not a sufficient basis for inclusion in the encyclopedia. While including information on recent developments is sometimes appropriate, breaking news should not be emphasized or otherwise treated differently from other information." This type of writing leads to an article bogged down by [[WP:RECENTISM]] and [[WP:ASOF]] statements that go out of date very quickly. Before adding current news stories, it is important to ask whether the material will date quickly and has enough long term notability.
*[[WP:TOPIC]] and [[WP:NOTHOWTO]]. Google is a large topic, and this article is primarily about the company. Detailed descriptions of the products and services offered are beyond the scope of the article, and should be left to the main articles involved.
*[[WP:PEACOCK]] and [[WP:PRIMARY]]. Quotes from company spokespersons saying that a product or service is innovative, cutting edge etc are unnecessary and should be removed.
*[[WP:V]] and [[WP:NPOV]]. Unsourced assertions and editorializing interpretations of source material should not be included.
Some material was removed as it had the issues mentioned above, but the article is still too choppy and lacks free flowing prose due to an excessive reliance on news stories.--'''''[[User:ianmacm|<span style="background:#88b;color:#cff;font-variant:small-caps">♦Ian<span style="background:#99c">Ma<span style="background:#aad">c</span></span>M♦</span>]] <sup>[[User_talk:ianmacm|(talk to me)]]</sup>''''' 16:30, 29 September 2013 (UTC)

== NSA data center surveillance ==

Re [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Google&diff=579704304&oldid=579615228 this edit]: The ''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story_2.html Washington Post]'' article says "a sketch shows where the “Public Internet” meets the internal “Google Cloud” where their data reside. In hand-printed letters, the drawing notes that encryption is “added and removed here!” The artist adds a smiley face, a cheeky celebration of victory over Google security." The drawing says “SSL added and removed here!” which appears to be a reference to [[Transport Layer Security‎]]. Since this was done without the knowledge or consent of Google (which made the company furious) and [[Keith B. Alexander|Keith Alexander]] denied having access to the U.S. computers involved [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24751821], it suggests that the material was decrypted and read while in transit between the data centers. There is also the possibility that this happened outside the USA, since Keith Alexander's response on Bloomberg TV has an element of [[non-denial denial]].--'''''[[User:ianmacm|<span style="background:#88b;color:#cff;font-variant:small-caps">♦Ian<span style="background:#99c">Ma<span style="background:#aad">c</span></span>M♦</span>]] <sup>[[User_talk:ianmacm|(talk to me)]]</sup>''''' 08:37, 1 November 2013 (UTC)

:There's a bit of ambiguity with a lot of the press descriptions of what the NSA is doing. The drawing does say that SSL/TLS is "added and removed here," but it doesn't suggest that the NSA is doing the removal. This is [[WP:OR]] on my part, but my interpretation from reading both the Post and NYTimes articles is that Google wasn't using a VPN on the back end because they assumed they controlled the pipes between data centers. --[[User:JHP|JHP]] ([[User talk:JHP|talk]]) 10:44, 1 November 2013 (UTC)

::And, actually, a new article from the Times seems to back up my assumption. They write, "Though tech companies encrypt much of the data that travels between their servers and users’ computers, '''they do not generally encrypt their internal data because they believe it is safe''' and because encryption is expensive and time-consuming and slows down a network."[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/technology/angry-over-us-surveillance-tech-giants-bolster-defenses.html?hp&_r=0&pagewanted=all] (Emphasis mine.)  --[[User:JHP|JHP]] ([[User talk:JHP|talk]]) 10:49, 1 November 2013 (UTC)

::Also, according to the [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/technology/nsa-is-mining-google-and-yahoo-abroad.html previous Times article], the NSA is collecting entirely overseas, but that effectively gives the NSA everything because Google is mirroring its data among data centers. --[[User:JHP|JHP]] ([[User talk:JHP|talk]]) 11:00, 1 November 2013 (UTC)

::Ars Technica also has an article describing how the NSA got access to Google's data. It also points out that Google was passing data unencrypted. "'''Within Google's internal network, these requests are passed unencrypted''', and requests often travel across multiple Google data centers to generate results. In addition to passing user traffic, the '''fiber connections between data centers are also used to replicate data between data centers''' for backup and universal access."[http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/how-the-nsas-muscular-tapped-googles-and-yahoos-private-networks/] (Emphasis mine.) So, again, it wasn't the NSA hacking into Google's servers and turning off encryption. It was Google failing to encrypt data inside its own network. --[[User:JHP|JHP]] ([[User talk:JHP|talk]]) 02:0November

It should be mentioned, as also other products like Panoramio.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/186.59.4.217|186.59.4.217]] ([[User talk:186.59.4.217|talk]]) 14:41, 16 July 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:[[Google Maps]] and [[Google Street View]] were added to the see also section.

because the existing version uses present tense subjunctive mood. What is clearly intended is past tense indicative mood. Li actually got the patent in the past, he is not "possibly" or "hypothetically" in the process of getting it now.

== See also: [[Criticism of Google]]? ==

Can anyone explain why all criticism of Google was shunted off into a [[WP:POVFORK]]? This is not normal procedure for pages on corporations, and you'll note that, for instance, [[Apple Inc.]] has criticism of Apple integrated into the article.

I would like to reintegrate some of the contents of [[Criticism of Google]] into this article. [[Criticism of Google]] can probably remain as an article (it's extremely long, and moving all the information in it over to this article would lead to severe balance issues,) but the current state of the [[Google]] article seems wholly unacceptable. You can't just make a "Criticism of X" article and then move everything negative about X into it, keeping the main article "clean". That is not how Wikipedia works.

Please consider this an RFC: it's going to be a big job, and I'd appreciate help with it! Input regarding how best to go about this would be much appreciated. --[[User:Ashenai|Ashenai]] ([[User talk:Ashenai|talk]]) 16:13, 7 August 2014 (UTC)

:How would you suggest we integrate a "Criticism" section to the [[Google]] page with the information from the [[Criticism of Google]] page without making it too lengthy? As you stated, moving all the information over would create a substantial imbalance and violate [[WP:UNDUE]]. How will we measure the importance of the criticisms and decide what deserves to be moved and what doesn't? No doubt the page should note the company's criticisms. The [[Apple Inc.]] page does not have a "Criticism" section but there are criticisms of the company scattered accordingly throughout the article. I would like to hear other user's thoughts on this. [[User:Meatsgains|Meatsgains]] ([[User talk:Meatsgains|talk]]) 17:39, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
:: I agree with [[User:Ashenai|Ashenai]] to integrate core contents of [[Criticism of Google]] into this article. I agree with [[User:Meatsgains|Meatsgains]] concern of weighing importance, but one just has to start somewhere (us 3 for example). I am neutral as to whether there needs to be a criticism section or if criticism can be scattered into history, environment sections etc. 
:: One thing i´d like to see updated ( but cant at this point due to semiprotection) is the following info for the environment section:
:: Google cut ties with the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google´s own scientists, because of ALEC´s stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.

==Brin's and Page's salaries==
Yes, these figures are artificially low so that Google has a basis for lowballing strong talent. They refused to lower their salaries because they can't lowball new talent to ''that'' extent. Google claims to want the best but, when faced with the best, rapidly turns tail: one person close to me who is a world-class expert in security and has experience far broader and deeper than Google's was of enough interest to them that four of their top engineers spent more than seven hours on the phone with him&mdash;only to have HR summarily phone him and say he was "underqualified."

I don't have the necessary privileges to edit the article as I just created my account and don't have 10 edits, but while I was messing around with a Wikipedia parsing script I made, I noticed that a space was needed in one spot.

"Most of its profits are derived from AdWords,[9][10]an online advertising service that places advertising near the list of search results."

After the "9][10]" and before "an" there should be a space. My parser removes anything in brackets or parentheses which is why I noticed this.

== Advertising Section ==

=== Forms of Advertising ===

Their is no discussion of how advertising is different from organic search order ranking - on the google search page.  Google has an observable policy for labeling advertisements.  It is not clear whether influencing the rank order of the organic search section, through googles licensing and partner programs,  should not also be considered a subliminal for of adversing, i.e selective product placement.  Perhaps a trivial mention of the issue and a link to Criticism of Google, with discussion there would be sufficient.  This issue is not google specific: applies to all search providers: Bing, Yahool..

== Add Google Internships Section to Google Page ==

{{edit semi-protected|Google|answered=yes}}
<!-- Begin request -->

This is a request to add a section titled 'Google Internships' to this page:

==Google Internships==

What's it really like to be an intern? In 2012, [[The Internship]] was released, a movie starring [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Owen Wilson]], who decide they want to take a shot at the tech industry and miraculously both score internships at Google. The movie sparked interest in the life of Google interns, and more students than ever applied to have their own shot. However, an internship at Google isn't exactly like the movie might depict it to be. Yes, it looks the same, given that it was filmed on the actual Google Mountain View Campus, but there are many differences. A Google internship entails mostly individual projects, although the interns are encouraged to learn about other interns' work. There isn't a big competition where teams of interns are pitted against one another, or nights where interns go out to strip clubs. However, there is a lot of fun. The free food is real, the nap pods are real, and the general relaxed and motivated attitude among Googlers is real.<ref name="what's it really like"{{cite web |url=http://whatsitreallyliketobeanintern.weebly.com/about.html| |title=The Life of an Intern|}}></ref>

;What are some of the different internship opportunities that Google offers for students?
* Technical Internships
* Product Management Internships
* U.S. Business Internships - BOLD
* Global Business Internships
* User Experience Internships

"Privacy" can go into google. if it is so big we can make an article "Google Privacy Policy" where we can cover Google's Privacy policy and not just 1 POV of "Criticisms" Accusations of Monopoly can easily fit inside Google Article. and the "Other Section" is mostly. Apple inc is a big company that focuses on products. so each product that warrants it has a article ( [[iPod]],[[iPhone]],[[iPad]], etc) google has a lot of services we can make articles for any services that have enough info ( including criticisms and non criticisms ) like Gmail, Search ( which might get sub articles even ) my point is the way we tackle big articles is breaking them down by Topic not by Point of View. It'd be a lot of work but it'll be worth it. [[User:Bryce Carmony|Bryce Carmony]] ([[User talk:Bryce Carmony|talk]]) 07:24, 13 March 2015 (UTC)

*'''Support''' Shunting the criticism off to another page on any article creates a biased shallow summary in most cases even if that is not always the goal. Here we haved detailed discussion of things like the Easter Egg cruft while there is no section or even any discussion at all of their privacy issues. Also criticism articles tend to become inflated list cruft and hard to read since any time anyone reads something they dont like or has a gripe they add to it. Better to include a shortened summary of the main controversies here and then delete new additions to the article which are trivial.

 Headline-1: '''Google will begin showing anti-ISIS ads to counter terrorism'''
* http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/02/09/google-will-begin-showing-anti-isis-ads-to-counter-terrorism.html?intcmp=hpbt1
QUOTE: "Not all weapons have a trigger, but that doesn't make them any less effective. No, I'm not talking about bombs, but rather about Google's new strategy to use its highly targeted advertising system in the battle against ISIS. Last week, Anthony House, the senior manager for public policy and communications at Google, revealed plans to show users anti-radicalization links in response to terrorism-related searches. The plan was outlined before a committee of the British parliament dedicated to counter-terrorism.

The program is still in its pilot stages, but House is hopeful that this new plan may provide a clever tool that protects the freedom of the Internet while protecting the livelihoods of the world's citizens ..." -- [[User:AstroU|AstroU]] ([[User talk:AstroU|talk]]) 09:29, 9 February 2016 (UTC) -- PS: FYI for future editing.

Put the name "Rajeev Motwani" with the google's founder member names, as he was the superior intellect for making this giant 'GOOGLE' a reality. He developed many key algorithms for it, also these algorithms were developed long before and are still being used in operating critical operations of Google. Hence Rajeev Motwani's contribution is exceptional and spectacular for which his name must be mentioned as the head google founder.

== Turing Visual Test ==

::It was an attempt to de-orphan an article. The body of the Turing article states that Google and Facebook are spending millions on the type of visual recognition that the Turing test does. Adding a link to that section seemed to be the best way to link it to a real-world example of an application that could make use of the Turing Test.

I'd love to hear specific input, though, if there's something I can try to help in changing or discussing? [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 19:44, 21 January 2017 (UTC)

== Controversy/Search Warrents ==

{{reply to|LocalNet}}I believe this story is interesting enough and important enough to mention on the Google Wiki.  It could even set a precedent. Its part of the total picture of what Google is and does.  [[User:Eggstress|Eggstress]] ([[User talk:Eggstress|talk]]) 12:03, 5 February 2017 (UTC)

: Hi {{ping|Eggstress}} Thank you for starting a discussion here. The issue in particular, as seen in [http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-usa-warrant-idUSKBN15J0ON this Reuters report you cited in your edit], discusses that a judge in the United States has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking information from emails stored in countries outside the United States. Google plans to repeal the decision, and points to an earlier, similar incident where Microsoft did not need to turn over data in the United States that originated from Ireland. This issue focuses on whether or not data stored in foreign countries can be required to be turned over to a legal authority in the United States, and I believe it more concerns laws and regulations rather than Google specifically (the fact that the article multiple times references Microsoft is also an example of this, and the article also states that "Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States", which would be an important fact to mention if we add the info). [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 12:36, 5 February 2017 (UTC)

::Hi {{reply to|LocalNet}} Glad to have this discussion here, many editors do not bother with this important part of editing, so I appreciate it. I have nobjections to adding that Google already turned over US-based emails, and that it is planning on repealing the decision to hand over the off-shore emails. We can also mention Microsoft's case here, if you think that makes the addition more neutral and informative. The point is that this is important news about Google and US laws and regulations regarding privacy, government authority, and the rights of private corporations. Google is a huge company that almost every single adult in the US interacts with close to everyday. This issue is interesting, important, and concerns Google directly. That is why some mention, whether detailed or general, should be found on Google's wiki page. If you want to write something that you think is relevant and helpful to the article, I will most likely agree to it, as long as the issue does get a mention. Great collaborating with you. [[User:Eggstress|Eggstress]] ([[User talk:Eggstress|talk]]) 13:12, 5 February 2017 (UTC)

::: {{ping|Eggstress}} It is indeed great to have a good discussion. However, I think we still disagree, and part of that is because I didn't properly explain my reasoning. I'll try again now. Although the case is about Google, the issue itself doesn't seem specific to Google (happened to Microsoft, with a different result); it is a developing story; and it seems that you have a personal interest in getting it in into the Google article based on some of the text you have written here. I don't want to give it [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. We disagree on how big the case is. Some points:
::: * "and concerns Google directly" - yes, but similar cases have also affected Microsoft, and also probably other companies that store data outside the United States. It doesn't appear to be a targeted effort towards Google, and could happen to any data company with storage outside the U.S.
::: * "issue is interesting, important" - Editorial bias. This is one of countless reports about Google and its data, and we have to be careful about what we give weight to.
::: * "important news" - While it is important to include major news stories on Wikipedia, this particular case might fall into the [[WP:NOTNEWSPAPER|policy on "most newsworthy events do not qualify for inclusion"]]. It is currently a developing story where the actual outcome isn't yet known.

::: I fully respect your opinion, but I also want to make sure we don't blast this headline to the front page. So, my thinking is that this case isn't yet notable enough for inclusion on Google's Wikipedia page. (P.S. Despite my examples of your language, this isn't an effort to oppose you or your edit. I am simply focused on the content.) [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 13:57, 5 February 2017 (UTC)

== Info in the lead ==

Hi everybody! I am looking at the lead section, and the short paragraph that "An August 2011 report estimated that Google had almost one million servers in data centers around the world. It processed over one billion search requests per day in 2009, and about 20 petabytes of data each day in 2008". The information is from 2008 (over 10 years ago), 2009 (almost 10 years ago), and 2011 (approximately 6 years ago). It's woefully out-of-date for a company that specializes in big data. Furthermore, the different pieces of information appear to have been one-time reveals, and not continuously updated numbers such as monthly active users. Additionally, the lead section does not contain anything about criticism or controversy, which is stuck at literally the bottom of the article. My suggestion? Remove the paragraph on servers, search requests and data processing, and replace it with a summary of criticism. Thoughts?

== "AtGoogleTalks" ==

Hi everybody! I was just taking a look at the article and noticed a section called [[Google#atGoogleTalks|AtGoogleTalks]]. I noticed a few things about it, the first being that it features no decent sources, with the only actual source present being a [http://abeautifulwww.com/2007/02/17/top-10-google-tech-talks/ questionable-looking personal website]. Two, I tried searching Google for actual information on the presentations, and found a strikingly low '''zero''' [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] discussing it. I tried searching over and over again with different search terms, and yet, nothing. This does not seem to be a notable topic that is discussed by the media. Rather than sitting and gathering dust, with the "citation needed" tag present since March 2015, I just want to remove it. It's obviously not a big deal. The topic has its [[AtGoogleTalks]] Wikipedia article, again lacking even a single decent source, with a citation needed tag present since May 2008, which just reinforces my point: This is not notable. I want to remove it. But I thought I'd ask here first, properly explaining my reasoning, and see if I receive any responses. :) [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 20:46, 24 April 2017 (UTC)

'''Update''': Going just a little further down reveals a "CodeF" subsection. Again, no sources, just a citation needed tag. I did, however, [http://www.computerworlduk.com/it-vendors/google-roll-out-female-diversity-scheme-annually-3341497/ find a source for that], but only a single publication that published a report in March 2012. I tried doing research to find updated information and other sources, but was unable to. In my opinion, this qualifies as [[WP:NOTNEWSPAPER|a news event rather than notable encyclopedic content]] and fails to meet notability requirements. I want to remove this subsection as well. [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 20:57, 24 April 2017 (UTC)

: I'd normally wait maybe 48 hours for a reply, but past experiences in advancing a potential edit on the talk page have shown me there aren't active people watching this article, so I will go ahead with the edit now. This post serves as a deeper explanation of my thinking. :) [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 06:47, 25 April 2017 (UTC)

== Full Re-write ==

I'm planning to attempt a full copy-edit of the article later this week.  Out of an abundance of caution, I want to point out that I worked at Google from 2007-2013, but no longer work there and own no stock in the company.  I plan to rely mostly on [[I'm Feeling Lucky (book)]] and [[Googled: The End of the World as We Know It]] as sources for any additions.

: Hi {{Ping|Power~enwiki}} Uhm, why? Putting aside the conflict-of-interest, which is enough to raise concerns on its own, what in the article needs to be fixed?

:: The history section is filled with a hodge-podge of news stories.  Some years have a lot of news coverage, others have none, and I don't see that corresponding to any actual difference in the rate at which Google did news-worthy things.  Acquisitions is particularly bloated.  Also, some references to "corporate revenue" should probably be moved to the [[Alphabet Inc.]] article. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 06:24, 9 May 2017 (UTC)

== Corporate Research? ==

I feel like discussions of internal tools such as Piper should be done in a single section, rather than being embedded in the history section.  Not sure what that section could be called, though. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 21:21, 12 May 2017 (UTC)
: Hi! If we're talking specifically about Piper, it's usually not a good idea to take a single paragraph or topic and make it into its own subsection. Are there other examples of "discussions of internal tools"? :) [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 08:15, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

::: {{Ping|Power~enwiki}} I personally think both of those pages should be deleted due to a lack of citations and a potential lack of notability, but that's another discussion. Regarding Piper, it's clearly sourced and somewhat relates to History in some aspects. I'm not sure it's enough information to justify its own subsection, and I don't currently see any better places for it among other details in this article, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts anyway. :) [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 20:38, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

:::: Google had (and still has) internal tools which were novel to the technology field.

== David Foster ==

This person is not notable on his own (no Wikipedia page); and a single employee's six-month tenure at Google is not notable to justify coverage in this article.  Google has hundreds of executives at his level, he may be the only one who has engaged in public self-promotion enough to have media coverage but he is still not notable.  Also, only being at Google six months, it is incredibly unlikely that he ever *did* anything notable in that time.

An article-length treatment of hardware devices by Google *might* justify his inclusion, but I wouldn't support it even there. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 19:19, 10 May 2017 (UTC)
: Hi {{Ping|Power~enwiki}} Thank you for coming to the talk page! First off, you keep mentioning David Foster as a person not being notable enough of his own. There's no objection there. I am disputing the fact that his position within the company, specifically aimed at its new hardware direction, isn't notable. He was hired during Google's efforts to create new hardware products, and then he leaves after only six months, and without the public knowing his replacement or how committed they are to the new devices launched while he was working there? Until more information is available, I personally see that as a notable aspect of Google's hardware direction. Also, please be aware that "it is incredibly unlikely that he ever *did* anything notable in that time" is editorial speculation. As far as I know, there isn't any information about how much he did or didn't accomplish, but having the position within the company that he did and then leaving after a short time after hardware product release seems justifiably important to me. [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 19:26, 10 May 2017 (UTC)
:: Is there any reference to anything Foster has done, other than joining Google or leaving Google?  Personnel turnover is generally not notable.  I would note that [[Paul Buchheit]] is not mentioned in the article, and he created GMail. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 21:22, 12 May 2017 (UTC)
::: Hi again! At the time of its addition to the article, Foster joining Google was important to establish the context of its then-upcoming hardware direction rather than specific accomplishments he made. I fully agree that people joining or leaving a company generally isn't important, but when the context explains an effort to create a result, it can become useful aspects of the history behind the actual result. Regarding Buchheit, the article has a weird split I've been wondering about for quite some time. It splits some, but not all, services into "Consumer services", listing the different products and services, but keeps hardware direction in "History". It's not an ideal solution, and I've been brainstorming solutions in my mind but without a real solution yet. Gmail was placed in "Consumer services" with very limited information, therefore the lack of a mention for Buchheit. [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 08:13, 13 May 2017 (UTC)
:::: That makes sense (at least for Osterloh); I'll try to find a way to solve the hardware/software weirdness but there's no easy fix. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 03:29, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
:::: I'm still not sure why Foster is notable. "Bloomberg's sources say that the search juggernaut won't be replacing Foster" means to me that he never had a major role at Google, merely an impressive press release when he joined. [[User:Power~enwiki|Power~enwiki]] ([[User talk:Power~enwiki|talk]]) 03:29, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
::::: {{Ping|Power~enwiki}} You make good points and a part of me does agree with what you are saying, but the Bloomberg article also states "Which makes us wonder what Google has up its sleeve for this year's round of hardware" in the very same paragraph as the sentence you quoted. But let's put it this way: At this time, I think his position within the company is notable enough for a mention. If, in a few short months, it turns out not to have had any significant consequences, then it can be removed. But I don't believe there is a hurry, or enough evidence, to support the removal at this time. [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 16:42, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
{{od}} Hi again {{Ping|Power~enwiki}} At Google I/O, the company announced further improvements to [[Google Home]]. They have also in the past announced a new [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel]] smartphone coming later in 2017. They appear to indeed be committed to hardware. I think we can safely remove information on David Foster now. :) Regarding the weird split between the "Push into hardware" and "Consumer services" sections, I have been brainstorming ways to make it look better, though it's a tricky situation. One example of what I personally think looks good, is [[Apple Inc.]]'s use a "Products" section, giving a deeper dive into the main products it offers that the company is notable for. For example, the "iPhone" subsection features information on the product, such as an image and a summary of key details. This is just one idea I have come up with, but I honestly just think it looks dull and uninteresting to just gather all services into an image-less basic description that offers very little insight. It wouldn't be that challenging to do this, either. Pretty much copy features info from the lead of different articles, adding sources and their respective images. For services based on other services ([[Inbox by Gmail]] from [[Gmail]] comes to mind), a simple mention is enough. Many of Google's services have received criticism over privacy, so repeating that everywhere isn't necessary either. Sticking to the services' respective feature sets would do the trick if you ask me. Thoughts? :) [[User:LocalNet|LocalNet]] ([[User talk:LocalNet|talk]]) 14:04, 28 May 2017 (UTC)

== Downfall ==

On July 4, 2017, Google pushed an android update that made the HOME BUTTON DISAPPEAR on millions of user's phones.

https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-and-s8-plus/814011-disappearing-home-button.html

Within 3 months, this set off a mass exodus from Google products and led to a 30% decline in the value of the company's stock.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.185.180.195|108.185.180.195]] ([[User talk:108.185.180.195#top|talk]]) 05:21, 11 September 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Google Memo ==

The memo was not about showing women were "ill-qualified to work in technology." To have this in the wikipedia page is extremely misleading - see https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/the-most-common-error-in-coverage-of-the-google-memo/536181/

"The balance of his memo argues that he is not against pursuing greater gender diversity at Google; he says it is against the current means Google is using to pursue that end and the way the company conceives of tradeoffs between the good of diversity and other goods."

The memorandum is about how Google is trying to achieve diversity incorrectly. He adds information about suggestions on how to get more women into the technology field based on their biological traits. Nothing in the memorandum is about how women shouldn't be in the technology field due to being "ill-qualified." That is an extremely biased opinion and should be left out.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Clown town|Clown town]] ([[User talk:Clown town#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clown town|contribs]]) 19:47, 9 August 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:That is ''one opinion'' of the meaning of the memo. Other interpretations are possible, and in fact, have been made. That you disagree with the NYT's interpretation is interesting, but of no relevance here. Your personal agreement or disagreement with the conclusions of a reliable source are not grounds to exclude that interpretation.

It's not an "opinion" at all, and the NYT did not offer an "interpretation" of Damore's article. It piped a quote, i.e., it lied about what someone had said, which used to be an automatic firing offense in newsrooms all over America, including the NYT.
  
::The NYT lied about Damore's article.

:*Yes they are grounds. The interpretation can be put in if you point in the primary source where he even mentions that women are "ill-qualified to work in technology." That is not in the article at all. It is about how to better include women and my article is a great reason to not include our words. It is debated and should not be put in the wiki page unless it is certain. There are equally qualified sources showing your interpretation is wrong. Thus, your pov should not be included in the wiki page.

The Atlantic analysis should be included as well, as it is also a reliable source, and we should balance differing views expressed in reliable sources.

[[User:NorthBySouthBaranof|NorthBySouthBaranof]] ([[User talk:NorthBySouthBaranof|talk]]) 16:34, 11 August 2017 (UTC)
As I read it, The New York Times challenged text doesn't run afoul of The Atlantic's alleged error; it is possible to be pro-diversity and still advance arguments about biological essentialism.  The New York Times quotes are that women "are biologically ill-suited to work in high-stress technology jobs" and that Google's biases have "clouded" their thinking on diversity.  Neither of these is to say that the memo is somehow anti-diversity.  It is possible to believe in gender stereotypes (whatever their inherent truth value) and yet be pro-diversity.  It would also be possible to disbelieve stereotypes and yet be anti-diversity.  The New York Times cite and quotes seem appropriate and apt to me.  It might be possible to work in The Atlantic, but that seems harder as the article is about the coverage rather than the event itself.  Just the way I see it!  Thanks.

== Corporation vs. LLC ==

I've reverted good faith changes made by {{u|Ethanmayersweet}} changing the "Inc." after Google to "LLC."  The user has correctly cited a secondary source, but to me it sounds prospective--it's a change that's either in process or contemplated.  Before we officially dive in for the change, I'd like to see something saying it has officially happened.  The user also directed me to business entity record in Delaware for a "Google, LLC" but I have issues with that both as a primary source, but also, because it's unclear exactly what falls where in the greater Alphabet corporate umbrella.  Add to it that the Delaware listing says the LLC was formed in 2002, and I don't know what to think, other than waiting for confirmation from a secondary source is a good idea.  Happy to hear from anyone who disagrees!  Cheers all, happy Friday. [[User:Dumuzid|Dumuzid]] ([[User talk:Dumuzid|talk]]) 19:33, 15 September 2017 (UTC)

* Hey {{u|Dumuzid}}, here's some sources for you.
:Press coverage:
:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-01/alphabet-wraps-up-reorganization-with-a-new-company-called-xxvi]] [[https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/google-parent-alphabet-forms-holding-company-xxvi-to-complete-2015-corporate-reorganization/] [https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/01/alphabet-finalizes-restructuring-with-a-new-company-called-xxvi/]
:See also lawsuit naming Google LLC as defendant: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/files/2017/09/Gab-lawsuit.pdf].
:Also just to clarify, the reason it says 2002 on the incorporation date is Google LLC is a reorganisation of Google Inc (putting it under XXVI Holdings Inc), so it doesn't get a fresh incorporation date.
:If you'd like anything else just let me know.
:{{u|Ethanmayersweet}}

* [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/ Goolge's own webpages] still outline Google Inc.; I suspect Google LLC was registered to prohibit other people from doing so. Since it is not in CA's databse, it also does not do business in CA, wherefore it is de fact inactive outside being registered, and sometimes (like in your lawsuit) simply mistaken. Regarding the date, Inc.s and LLCs are two different types of companies and need to be registered individually (a renaming does not do the trick, its different taxing et al.); note that both a Google Inc. and a Google LLC were registered 10/22/2002, each with their own file number (so different legal entities, not renamings). Given that I was not able to find any mention of "Google LLC" on Google's own pages, but a lot of "Google Inc." + Google LLC never having been active in California since incorporation (dormant), I believe that the supposed switch (as given in the three articles above) never actually happened, and the company structure stood the same, with just the addition of Alphabet and non-Google-named subsidiaries moved to it ("anonymous acquisitions" I believe it is called).

* Ethanmayersweet, all of those sources suffer from the same problem, to me -- they all put the conversion in inchoate terms: we're "changing" or "updating."  Not "we have changed" or "we have updated."  They read to me like declarations of intent rather than statements of fact.  I think you'll be right soon enough, but I'd personally like an unambiguous statement to that effect.  If consensus is against me, that's cool too.  Thanks.

== Organize Google services in a table? ==

In the main paragraph, a really long sentence lists the services Google offers (e.g. Translate, Drive, Gmail). A table may be better to organize the information, which is difficult to read as a sentence.

=== TAXES OWED BY GOOGLE ===
Created on 30/03/2018 at 11:15 pm:
Google having been created to generate a maximum of money(silver), everything is implemented by this company(society) to avoid the treasury of most of the countries, even the USA: the profit, always the profit....
As a result, GOOGLE managed to become established all over the world without paying of taxes in most of these countries, but by managing to impose its diktat: you play my game(set,play) or you clear(release) of my system. I do not give for a long time to my assertion so that she(it) is erased by a moderator against diligent spy pro-googled to erase him(it)....
Attention: if it is you the administrator(director) who intervenes to erase this, your name and your IP of against spy will be registered(recorded) for a complaint to whom it may concern for abuse of dominant position and abolition(deletion) of real data.

== "Simple design", "little experience", dubious comment? ==

Near the top is a screenshot of Google beta in 1998, and the thumbnail text reads: "Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages." [source]. But this was 1998, and back then the vast majority of webpages were "simple" indeed, so it sounds pretty inaccurate in my book. I know there is a source attached but I'd imagine this would be a minority's viewpoint on the matter. --[[User:Tim42|Tim42]] ([[User talk:Tim42|talk]]) 19:51, 13 January 2019 (UTC)
