In that image, internet access in the US is less than 25%.  That data must be extraordinarily old, or otherwise wrong (the high end of the chart is about 20% of a nation's population being "internet users").

:No, it's recent (June 2007), it's in tens of thousand, so you have to multiply the figures by 10<sup>4</sup>, which for the USA gives a percentage of more than 60% (205,320,000/300,000,000). [[User:16@r|16@r]] ([[User talk:16@r|talk]]) 04:32, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

== "Countries where Internet access is available to the majority of the population" ==

The list of countries is vague as to how the list has been compiled. The section title is too long, and content is subjective. 
We need to decide on how to define "majority" and whether the list is based on '''total users''' or '''internet penetration''' or '''both'''.

== Pointless map ==

The map gives the internet connection density ''times'' the number of inhabitants of a country. Now who on earth could be interrested in that? It's the internet connection density we want to know. On top of that, the scale is rather weird. Why not round numbers? [[User:DirkvdM|DirkvdM]] ([[User talk:DirkvdM|talk]]) 07:24, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

== Logic of second paragraph ==

The second paragraph begins to discuss a topic (speed) that is not relevant to the issue of access.  It may be a good paragraph, but it belongs in another article, or under a separate subheading here.  Furthermore, its first sentence seems to promise to define speed then wanders off without fulfilling the promise.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ertdfgcvb|Ertdfgcvb]] ([[User talk:Ertdfgcvb|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ertdfgcvb|contribs]]) 02:18, 5 October 2008 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Finally, the phrase "new media" is constantly repeated implying that it has a special meaning.  What is it?  Does new media mean internet?  This should be clearly defined at first mention.

== simplistic analogy needed? ==

I came to this article because of an issue I don't understand.  How can electrical/phone wires carry signals up and down at the same time?  And, by logical extension, to what extent are such internet connections "elastic" in terms of carrying capacity?

This comes from my thoughts of a non-elastic old technology (water flowing through a water pipe).  It is clear that internet connectivity breaks that analogy in terms of two-directional flow, but to what extent does the analogy apply?  Only to old-tech dialup service?

My lack of understanding may be explained by the fact that I'm old, but I think children will also ponder this analogy.  Wikipedia is for everybody, right?  A little help?

:Almost all telephones carry signals up and down on the same wires.  The principle is older than the telephone, and more than a hundred years older than Internet.

== Weird tone about ADSL ==

The paragraph on ADSL sounds like it was written in 2002. "Is becoming more widely available and can provide an excellent internet connection." It already became widely available even in poor countries 5-6 years ago and a 1024/256 plan is on the far low end as of 2009 and most can provide speeds way higher than this by now. ADSL itself is already a decade old technology, so citing this as a "standard" for internet access is rather off.--[[User:Spectatorbot13|Spectatorbot13]] ([[User talk:Spectatorbot13|talk]]) 08:43, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

What is "Wizzy Digital Courier"? It is a red link in this article in a list of lesser used Internet access technologies. Is it an Internet access technology?  Does it belong in this article?  Are there any references that can be used for it?

A Wikipedia article for Wizzy Digital Courier was deleted:
* 08:36, 8 March 2012 [[User:Woohookitty|Woohookitty]] ([[User talk:Woohookitty|talk]] | contribs) deleted page [[Wizzy Digital Courier]] (Expired PROD, concern was: Lack of notability and references; the few inbound links from other articles are tentative; website no longer exists)

(and the only contributor was '159.148.13.146')

I found this at  http://www.enotes.com/topic/Wizzy_Digital_Courier :
<Blockquote>'''Wizzy Digital Courier''' is a project to distribute useful data to places with no Internet connection. Primarily for e-mail, it also carries web content (stored locally in a web cache). From an early description of the project 1:
 <p>
:''Data normally carried by the dial up telephone link is instead physically carried by a mobile computer between the end user's location and a high bandwidth data drop to the Internet.''
 <p>
Delivery mechanisms are by overnight dialup, taking advantage of discount calling rates outside business hours, or USB memory stick. The USB stick uses the UUCP protocol, carrying information to and from a better-connected location - perhaps a school or local business, which acts as the dropoff for Email, and fetches web content by proxy. The email and web content is re-packaged as a UUCP transaction, and ferried back on the USB stick.
 <p>
The project site offers a bootable CD image that lets users install Wizzy Digital Courier onto a computer, erasing what is already on the computer and installing a new operating system (a modification of CentOS Linux, itself a derivative of Red Hat Enterprise Linux) along with all of the Wizzy content.
</Blockquote>

My thinking right now is that Wizzy Digital Courier should be removed from this article and probably most or even all of the other Wikipedia articles where it currently appears. I'll do that in a few days depending on the reactions from others posted to this talk page.

== "broadband cable provides a [?dedicated?] continuous connection with an ISP" ==

Location of Quote: Cable Internet access, Broadband access, Technologies.

I'm no expert in this topic or Wikipedia, but as far as I know, the bandwidth of that type of connection is not dedicated for each user. In fact, each group of users happen to be sharing an amount of bandwidth (''where the group count and their assigned bandwidth is set by the ISP''), which would lead to congestion if all of the group's users attempt to utilize the full amount of bandwidth they registered for.

For reference, read the last two paragraphs of "Data Rates" in the same page, and "Shared bandwidth" in "Cable Internet Access" page.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ktx2skd|Ktx2skd]] ([[User talk:Ktx2skd|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ktx2skd|contribs]]) 09:32, 17 June 2012 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Human Rights status in Estonia, Spain in Finland ==

=== Estonia ===

I am doing some research on the situation in Estonia and there is besides the cited article (http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0701/p07s01-woeu.html) no other source that Estonia has recognized the human rights character.

Legislation in 2000 has tackled this matter via an universal access strategy (§ 5 (1) Telecommunications Act 9 February 2000 (repealed), http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X30063K6.htm) and a right to internet access in public libraries (§ 33 Public Information Act Passed 15 November 2000; availble at http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X40095K4.htm). There is not one classification as human or fundamental right.

Other researches have not found anything more: http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/media/CDMSI/CDMSI(2012)Misc3_en.pdf.

=== Spain and Finland ===
The known legal sources for Finland (Sec. 60(C), Communications Market Act of 2003) and Spain (Art. 52, Sustainable Economy Act of 2011) do contain only universal service, that is not a human right.

== Combination of FTTx and VDSL or ADSL ==

*It appears that some countries—such as Japan—use a combination of FTTx and VDSL to serve most condos (except for new condos that have been prewired with optical fiber; in this case shared optical fiber is used). (For individual houses, it appears that shared optical fiber is currently preferred). 
*Optical fiber to a box on the street, and ADSL from there, is apparently used in many countries—such as in many parts of the US, I've heard. In Japan, the whole path from the telephone exchange to the subscriber is usually controlled by the telephone company, and VoIP phone service—including emergency number access—is offered more cheaply than POTS over copper. 
*Related Wikipedia articles appear to barely mention—or even omit—the situation where a combination of FTTx and VDSL or FTTx and ADSL is used. I'm wondering about the best way to cover this... [[User:LittleBenW|LittleBen]] ([[User talk:LittleBenW|talk]]) 03:26, 12 January 2013 (UTC)

== Natural disasters and access? ==

The last section of the article, "[[Internet access#Natural disasters and access|Natural disasters and access]]" leaves me a bit uncomfortable. It just seems unbalanced and somewhat alarmist. My understanding is that the Internet has performed fairly well in the face of many natural and man made disasters. The section as currently written focuses on problems without saying anything positive about the Internet's performance and that tends to distort the view presented of the current situation.

== Net neutrality ==

I'm uneasy about the way net neutrality is described in the second-to-last graf of the "Pricing" section:
<blockquote>Some ISPs estimate that about 5% of their users consume about 50% of the total bandwidth.[66] To ensure these high-bandwidth users do not slow down the network for everyone, some ISPs are considering, are experimenting with, or have implemented combinations of traffic based pricing, time of day or "peak" and "off peak" pricing, and bandwidth or traffic caps.</blockquote>
This seems to blindly support the stance of the ISPs, which isn't a crime, but does exclude the other viewpoint: It would be just as easy to replace last in necessity necessary aware in these high-bandwidth users do not slow down the network for everyone" with '''"Rather than upgrading their infrastructure to keep up with changing demand."''' I'm sure this invites a whole new discussion, but that particular line seemed to most obviously blame users for the shortcomings of providers and endorse one side of a debate that is still unsettled.[[User:Rabdill|Rabdill]] ([[User talk:Rabdill|talk]]) 21:14, 23 February 2014 (UTC)

:{{Done}}. I don't think the paragraph in question is about [[net neutrality]]. At least net neutrality is not mentioned by name in this part of the article or in the cited sources. In any case I reworked the paragraph to more closely follow the cited sources and to give both sides of the issue.

== Just what is "Broadband" access anyway? ==

Under the "broadband" heading, we have "multilink"... multilink is definitely NOT "broadband". I think the problem here is not with including "multilink" in this article, but with using (misusing) the term "broadband" as a heading for this section. this section should be reneame something else and broadband should come under the new heading alongside multilink. Some other subheadings in addition to "multilink" do not belong under the "broadband" heading. Then again, popular usage perhaps changes everthing ... even when it bears no connection to the (an) original meaning for any word... maybe "broadband" is like that??? But I don't think so... :) ... somebody please change the "broadband" heading to "High speed" or something like that. "Higher speed"? "Fast data rate"?

Oy... I see now that "broadband" is used / mis-used throughout this article and not only in connection with this points I made above.

::: Unfortunately, other graphs from the same source "based on information found at the reference" turned out not to be the case and data was created that wasn't in the source even though the graph claimed it to be there.  Second, primary sources should be avoided.  “Fixed (wired)-broadband monthly subscription charge, in USD” is data.  Not sure where or who says it's a measure of "affordability" as is claimed in the graph and is why we avoid primary sources.   Without a source that combines the two metrics cited as an indicator of affordability, it's just a pretty picture without a supporting reference.  It's even more onerous to check because the data isn't readily available.  It's also misleading because the author of the graph and the WP editor that uploaded it and added it to the article are apparently the same person.  Oxford isn't vouching for the graph, they simply provide visualization tools.  The graph itself is a creation from a dataset unrelated to Oxford so Ixford isn't the source of the data.  --[[User:DHeyward|DHeyward]] ([[User talk:DHeyward|talk]]) 21:33, 11 May 2015 (UTC)

::: {{u|W163}} for reference, see this discussion about the same institute and the same [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science#Names_of_internet_trunk_lines person creating a "map" of submarine trunk lines.]  It's made up.  It was in our article until someone realized it was made up and had no secondary source support.  It's a pretty graph, though.  Just not reliable and not reflecting the sources claimed.  --[[User:DHeyward|DHeyward]] ([[User talk:DHeyward|talk]]) 02:37, 12 May 2015 (UTC)

:::: Is there any evidence that the map/graphic in this article (Internet access) is inaccurate or that it doesn't fairly present the data from the ITU and the World Bank?  Or is the only complaint here that the author of this map/graphic and another map/graphic are the same and that some people don't agree with how the other graphic was produced? I think we should stick to talking about the map/graphic in this article and not base judgements on some other unrelated graphic. --[[User:W163|Jeff Ogden (W163)]] ([[User talk:W163|talk]]) 03:01, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
