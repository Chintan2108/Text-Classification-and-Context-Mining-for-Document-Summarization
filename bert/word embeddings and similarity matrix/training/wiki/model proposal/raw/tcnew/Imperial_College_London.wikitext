== Photos ==
Restoring archived discussion on photos.

[[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]] and I had consensus that high quality photos could be found for:
*'''the main entrance'''
*'''one of the college-run bars''' (such as the bar inside Beit Hall) or other social spaces
*'''World leaders speaking with students and faculty at Imperial''' (such as President Xi, Prince Albert of Monaco, or The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani) (these photos were previously quite well liked by others and could be added with appropriate copyright permissions, which I had trouble sourcing) ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|MikeCurry1]]) 20:36, 13 March 2019 (UTC)

== Problems with the lead ==

As currently written, the history section of the lead comes across as very confusing to anyone who does not already know Imperial's history:
* It gives the impression the foundation of Imperial  and the presence of the three founding colleges was part of Albert's original 1851 vision ("Royal Colleges" talked about in the plural and capitalised also normally refers to the royal colleges of physicians, surgeons, etc.)
* The sentence about the Imperial Institute's foundation stone being laid, directly followed by the granting of the royal charter, gives the impression the university was founded as the Imperial Institute then became Imperial College and merged with the other three colleges.
* It is nowhere stated that Imperial is actually in Albertopolis.
* The phrase "In 1907, the university was granted a Royal Charter" gives the impression Imperial College became a university by royal charter in 1907.
* The University of London is not mentioned at all, a very strange omission at odds with what is done on pages of other former colleges of federal universities.
* Unlike virtually every other college that has gone on to become a university, the date when Imperial became a university is not mentioned.
* The addition of medicine to the name in 1988, which would appear to be where the sentence on the medical school is going, isn't mentioned.
* There is no clue as to why the business school is significant enough to be mentioned in the lead, making this look like recentism. There's not even a clue in the body as to why this is here.

I suggest:
* Reword the Prince Albert sentence along the lines of "In 1851,  [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] started building his vision for a cultural area (nicknamed [[Albertopolis]]) in [[South Kensington]]; over the following decades, a number of cultural and educational institutions were founded here or relocated to the area." – starting the article with a large (but incomplete) list of institutions that are near to, but not actually associated with, the university distracts from the subject of the article.
* Remove the sentence on the laying of the foundation stone of the Imperial Institute, which has no obvious bearing on the article
* Reword the sentence on the charter along the lines of "In 1907,  Imperial College was established by [[Royal Charter]] in Albertopolis, bringing together the [[Royal College of Science]], the [[Royal School of Mines]] and the [[City and Guilds College]] that were already based there." – make it absolutely explicit this was the establishment of Imperial and tie it to the bit about Albertopolis.
* Remove the sentences on the medical and business schools unless these can be expanded to explain why they ate important enough to be in the lead.
* Add a sentence along the lines of "At its centenary in 2007, Imperial College left the University of London, which it has been part of since its foundation, and became a university in its own right."

The full opening paragraph would then read:
{{Quote| Imperial College London (officially Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine) is a public research university located in London, United Kingdom. In 1851,  [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] started building his vision for a cultural area (nicknamed [[Albertopolis]]) in [[South Kensington]]; over the the following decades, a number of cultural and educational institutions were founded here or relocated to the area. In 1907, Imperial College was established by [[Royal Charter]] in Albertopolis, bringing together the [[Royal College of Science]], the [[Royal School of Mines]] and the [[City and Guilds College]] that were already based there. At its centenary in 2007, Imperial College left the University of London, which it has been part of since its foundation, and became a university in its own right.}}

This would keep the length about the same, concentrate on Imperial and important parts of its history, and remove elements that were treated too briefly to justify their presence. [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] ([[User talk:Robminchin|talk]]) 19:07, 19 January 2019 (UTC)

: I would agree that this kind of focus would be much better, however, I was told on previous occasions that the basis we were working from had historic editor consensus. I don't particularly think your suggestion is perfectly worded, but I agree on it mostly in terms of substance. However, seeing as the current version has been fought over quite a bit I would leave any suggestions here for long enough to make sure people have a chance to respond before making any edits to the articles. 

:* ''It gives the impression the foundation of Imperial and the presence of the three founding colleges was part of Albert's original 1851 vision ("Royal Colleges" talked about in the plural and capitalised also normally refers to the royal colleges of physicians, surgeons, etc.)'' – In a way they were, at least in the sense they were the academic part of the building. Also Royal Colleges can be discussing any [[Royal College]]s, Music, etc. Just because they can commonly refer to the medical colleges, doesn't make this reference incorrect, although I agree clarity might be preferred.
:* The sentence about the Imperial Institute's foundation stone being laid, directly followed by the granting of the royal charter, gives the impression the university was founded as the Imperial Institute then became Imperial :College and merged with the other three colleges. – I '''''completely''''' agree, but I keep getting shot down on this.
:* It is nowhere stated that Imperial is actually in Albertopolis. – ''Disagree'', Albertopolis is more of a buzzword in my experience (I know, I know, [[WP:NOR]]) than a commonly used term referring to the area, which is more often called [[South Kensington]]. Whilst I agree it is important to reference it in the article, I don't see the need for it to be prominent in the lead at all. 
:* The phrase "In 1907, the university was granted a Royal Charter" gives the impression Imperial College became a university by royal charter in 1907. – Agree
:* The University of London is not mentioned at all, a very strange omission at odds with what is done on pages of other former colleges of federal universities. – Agree
:* Unlike virtually every other college that has gone on to become a university, the date when Imperial became a university is not mentioned. – Agree
:* The addition of medicine to the name in 1988, which would appear to be where the sentence on the medical school is going, isn't mentioned. – ''Disagree'', Not particularly relevant for a lead at all, a small name change to the official, today seldom used name (as per brand's own guidelines and media usage, when compared to ''"Imperial College London"''), this is rightly covered in the history section. The addition of medicine to the college, however, is relatively important, as many historically relevant medical schools came under the college's banner ([[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]], [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School]] to name a few).
:* There is no clue as to why the business school is significant enough to be mentioned in the lead, making this look like recentism. There's not even a clue in the body as to why this is here. – No strong views

: If people are interested in changing it, I would suggest the following tweaked version, which doesn't seem so heavy handed with Albertopolis – which in [[WP:NOR|my personal experience]] seems to be more of a buzzword that something commonly used – and reduces clunky/repeated wording ''("here or relocated to the area", "that were already based there"), with the same substance:

: Anyway, that's just my thoughts, and to be honest, it would be more productive to work more on continuing to improve the quality of the history section, and the other articles on the topic, which receive much less editor attention  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 21:15, 19 January 2019 (UTC)
::::I think Shadowssettle hit the nail on the head.  The previous version of this intro paragraph has had a lot of editor consensus over its history. I also don't particularly think your suggestion is perfectly worded.  I can agree with some minor substance ideas, but think some of the level of criticism is exaggerated.  The current intro is clear and has been stable for a long time. I do not think this proposed version is more clear than the original version.  I do not think the intro paragraph should be rewritten after all the consensus and discussions taking place to hash it out.  At the same time, I can be okay with part of robminchins suggestion. The reason for my revert of the UofL part was because it used to say UofL in the intro a long time ago, this was removed and has not been in the intro for awhile, and then recently replaced with the royal colleges part in the same sentence of the intro where UofL used to be.  I am okay with keeping UofL in the intro. It seemed others were trying to figure out how to put UofL in the intro but did not know how.  We can add the UofL part back in.  I do not think the intro should be rewritten though removing the part about the queen and opening the business school or the opening of the school of medicine.  I also prefer the original second sentence with more specificity. I really do not like the proposed changes over the current historical version that has been widely discussed with a lot of consensus.  At the same time, while I reverted your last edit about UofL, because of shadowssettles edit to add the royal colleges instead.  Please add it back in as you have my consensus for this change. It was proposed in two places originally when I reverted it, I think UofL only needs to be said once in the intro. I do not want to hash out the intro AGAIN, and I 100% agree with Shadowssettle that to be honest it would be far more productive to continue to improve the quality of the history section, and the other articles on the topic, which receive much less editor attention than this intro has.  If you have suggestions for the UofL part, please add that to the current intro, without rewriting the intro through lengthy and contentious discussion. I would much rather focus on the history or other sections as suggested by both shadowssettle and myself than on this intro paragraph AGAIN that many users for the most part like - despite the very few problems that every editor has with intros on very popular wiki articles.  I think that is what your biggest point was anyways on UofL being in the intro, so perhaps we can add that in, then move on as Shadowssettle also suggested to the history or other sections or related articles.<!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:141B:CACB:E98D:662A:6074:248D|2605:E000:141B:CACB:E98D:662A:6074:248D]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:141B:CACB:E98D:662A:6074:248D#top|talk]]) 19:48, 20 January 2019 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:::::I had removed the sentence about Queen Victoria laying the foundation stone from the intro.  It seems like the history edits have been the most productive section to improve (and could use future editing) as it has new very useful information, while it is still aiming to be sharp and concise. In terms of the intro, I think the one sentence to possibly adjust - (without rewriting it due to the plethora of editors giving consensus opinions on the intro over time) would be that 1907 sentence.  It seems after Robminchins productive edits in the history section that city and guilds was not incorporated in 1907, but joined in 1910.  Should we remove city and guilds from this sentence or edit that sentence of the intro?  Without rewriting the intro since a lot of editors have weighed in over time, any ideas for that particular intro sentence?

:::::: Just leaving out C&G College would also be wrong, as C&G's support and the intent off merging in their college were vital parts of the scheme from at least 1905, it just took a bit longer to get sorted out than the two government colleges. Possibly something like: "Imperial was formed from three older colleges, the [[Royal College of Science]], [[Royal School of Mines]], and [[City and Guilds College]], and incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1907." This would avoid saying that the charter actually merged all three colleges in 1907 but retain the concept of the three founding colleges. [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] ([[User talk:Robminchin|talk]]) 06:43, 24 January 2019 (UTC)
::::::: I don't mind that change a bit, but, to clear it up, actually the original merger of the C&G was in 1907, but it was not incorporated until later (see source provided) and there has already been a discussion over it (scroll up), the current wording being the simplest source-backed wording that could be agreed upon. If you want to change it, feel free on my account (I'm not against a modified version of your new intro, as I've already said)  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 18:04, 24 January 2019 (UTC)
::::::::Ah, okay, that makes sense.  So we should definitely have C&G in that sentence.  I was trying to edit it per the history description.  It makes sense that this sentence is actually accurate though after reading what shadowssettle wrote/and looking up a source.  I therefore seen no reason to add the three oldest colleges to the sentence (or at the end of the sentence the colleges already there).  Anything being merged would be older, so it makes these added words appear redundant here. It makes sense that the current wording is the simplest source-backed wording that could be agreed on, and so should be kept.  At the same time, I am also okay with the initial version from Robminchin's proposed change of that sentence.  "In 1907, Imperial College was established by [[Royal Charter]] in Albertopolis, bringing together the [[Royal College of Science]], the [[Royal School of Mines]] and the [[City and Guilds College]] that were already based there."  I remember shadowsssettle saying Albertopolis does not need to be in the sentence, and I thought the end descriptor (that were already based there) is not needed. So adjusting Robminchin's proposed version would lead to this with minor grammar and clarity improvements, if desired to adjust it:
::::::::"In 1907, Imperial College was established by [[Royal Charter]], bringing together the [[Royal College of Science]], the [[Royal School of Mines]] and the [[City and Guilds College]]."
::::::::Let us know if you prefer that one.  It is not dramatically different as the sentence appears accurate from the one that was agreed on from the comments b4, but may be a slight improvement.

:::::::::This slighlty altered version of the proposed sentence by [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] is fine to use by me.  Yes, this seems clear so I incorporated it.[[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 02:40, 25 January 2019 (UTC)

== History Section ==
My edits were just reverted.  I think the history section needs to be improved.  New information was just added.  A lot of which is great.  I read through the GA Class articles, and what it recommends for the history section.  It says that events need to be notable.  I was trying to remove a few extraneous details, that I did not think were as notable to the college history. I was also trying to keep the writing concise.  This is per GA class style guide.  Any comments?  [[Wikipedia:Good_article_criteria]]  [[Wikipedia:College and university article advice]]
:I think the extra information is good. If the history becomes too long then a [[History of Imperial College London]] subpage can be started, but I think for the moment it is better to have this information in the article. What you might deem as "not as notable" could be subjective [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 16:30, 3 February 2019 (UTC)
:: I agree with [[u|Aloneinthewild]]. The history section as it currently exists is a similar length to those of Bristol, Durham and King's (the UK university GAs with a similar length of history), but ''all'' of those have history subpages. These allow for a lengthier treatment on the subpage, with only the most notable events presented concisely on the main page. But until we have a large enough history section to justify a separate page, this content should go here. There's still plenty of history not here (Nobel prize work done at Imperial is an obvious lacuna that can be filled from sources on Imperial's webpage). If Bristol has enough history to justify a subpage ([[History of the University of Bristol]]) then I'm sure Imperial does, so once the section is a bit more complete we can start start discussing what should be kept on this page and what should only be on a subpage. [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] ([[User talk:Robminchin|talk]]) 17:21, 4 February 2019 (UTC)
::: It is also with considering that any discussion of whether something is notable on Wikipedia needs to start from [[WP:NOTABILITY]]. Items in the history that are sourced only to the Imperial website, such as the establishment of departments, are  objectively less notable for Wikipedia purposes than those from third-party sources. Imperial gaining indicated funding, which the OP deleted n their edits, is discussed as historically significant in a third-party academic article published 30 years later – by Wikipedia's criteria, this is unarguably notable. [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] ([[User talk:Robminchin|talk]]) 17:36, 5 February 2019 (UTC)
::::Yes, perhaps the history subpage [[History of Imperial College London]] suggested would be a nice idea.  For me the current extra length reduces my personal readability of the page on aggregate. The history section is nice to read on its own.  In aggregate combined with reading the rest of the page together, it is hard for me to read through in one sitting to get to the bottom of this wiki encyclopedia article.  So I personally would also vote for a history subpage too, as I feel it is a little bit long for me, and being a bit more concise would help me read through to the bottom of the article in one sitting.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/87.224.71.115|87.224.71.115]] ([[User talk:87.224.71.115#top|talk]]) 09:28, 16 February 2019 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::::::Yes, I agree, the history section is 2500 words which is the equivalent to 5 pages single spaced or 10 pages double spaced.  The [[Wikipedia:College and university article advice|university article advice]] page above stated that when an article becomes too large and comprehesnive it is beneficial to break the article off into a sub-page.  Therefore, I think there is sufficient justification for the sub-page proposed by [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]], [[History of Imperial College London]].  The Wiki example - Featured University articles for the first five colleges Duke, Dartmouth, Georgtown, Michigan State University, and University of Michigan have 1200, 1300, 900, 1350, and 1400 words respectively in their history sections as a summary, with many using a seperate sub-page for the history.  I think somewhere in that range of a 900-1400 words summary, similar to these example featured wiki university articles is prefered, (probably closer to 1300-1400 words), with the seperate history sub-page.[[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 19:00, 6 April 2019 (UTC)
::::::: I concur. The section is now long enough to justify splitting it off. This does raise the question as to whether we trim here by removing details from the history section (which can leave a rather disjointed "Here is a fact. Here is another fact." text) or removing whole items as less important – in which case, which ones? [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] ([[User talk:Robminchin|talk]]) 05:19, 7 April 2019 (UTC)
:::::::: Thats good.   Perhaps, we can copy this current history section onto the page AloneintheWild suggested, [[History of Imperial College London]].  Then we can try to make a summary on the wiki page of the most notable facts as suggested by [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] removing what we believe is less notable as a whole (since it will be more connected).  The main history points will probably be obvious and stick out.  There may be a lot of agreement on which are the most notable facts.  For example, if the Queen opens a school it has clear historical signicance and sticks out.  So, I think consensus decisions could help determine what to include - since the historical event will be notable to the most people.  I imagine the history section could be a high level general summary (such as done well by [[Harvard University]] 1161 words, while having a more detailed and comprehensive [[History of Harvard University]] section.  I imagine also the [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/history/college-developments/ Imperial College London Official History] may be a good source for determining the most significant facts historically too.

== What parts to remove ==
[[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]], [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]], [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]] 
I am starting a discussion so we can gain democratic consensus and agreement on what parts to remove from the main article?  Everyone may have different opinions, so we can better discuss to gain agreement and consensus.  Robminchin was mentioning removing some details vs. whole sections.  If so, what parts should be removed in peoples opinions, and are there any sections too detailed to make the summary concise.[[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 20:46, 9 April 2019 (UTC)
:So to start the discussion, I think with [[User:Robminchin|Robminchin]] said could help frame the differences in history sections between the two pages, '''"These allow for a lengthier treatment on the subpage, with only the most notable events presented concisely on the main page."'''
:Some possible less notable whole sections to remove that could be kept on the sub page could be:
:1) A paragraph about 2002, The discussion of Imperial taking over UCL - the take over did not occur.
:2) A paragaph about 1912; this seems concisely said on the next line about 1919 already. [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 02:56, 10 April 2019 (UTC)

:: That seems sensible to me. I already removed quite a lot of parts which I didn't think anyone would have any objections to being unimportant enough to be removed from the summary, with the idea that it could be whittled down to something lighter, without the need to worry about the more peripheral details. If anyone has any objection to that change feel free to bring some of it back, it was just done to speed up the summarisation process, and make sure the interim summary was short enough that it could at least be seen as a suitable temporary summary, so that the articles weren't left ostensibly half-finished. I don't have much time to contribute to this at the moment, hence the [[wP:OGRE|occasional flash of edits]], but those kind of changes seem sensible.

==Fleming==
Someone keeps removing references to Alexander Fleming. Fleming studied at St Mary's Medical School, which was not part of Imperial at the time that he studied but has since been merged with it. Thus he is an alumnus of Imperial. The medical building is named after him, for goodness sake!
:On the contrary, if that is his only link with Imperial, then he is ''not'' an alumnus of Imperial. The fact that the SAF building is named after him is irrelevant.. Stalin wasn't born in Stalingrad. If you wanted to say "He is an alumnus of St Mary's which merged with Imperial in ..." that would be fair enough. [[User:Zargulon|Zargulon]] 10:05, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
:By the way, what do you have against the sentence '' The college's official title is Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, which it used in public relations up to 2002.''? [[User:Zargulon|Zargulon]] 10:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
:Can we please sort this out here before you go on to edit the list of alumni page.. [[User:Zargulon|Zargulon]] 10:14, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
Of course it makes him an alumnus of Imperial. He went to St Mary's, St Mary's is part of Imperial. Where is the argument here?
As for the statement about the full name, it is pointless and if it should be in the article for some minor interest then it certainly doesn't belong in the opening paragraph. I mean, who cares what the full name is? The opening paragraph should simply give an overview of the essential information.
:I moved the statement about the name out of the introduction as per your request. I still disagree over the definition of an alumnus - I think it has to refer to the institution in its state when they attended it, regardless of what happened afterwards. For instance, if somone went to Hogwarts college, and afterwards Hogwarts college became defunct and completely ceased to exist, would that make them not an alumnus of anywhere? It is also certainly true that if you asked Fleming during his lifetime if he was an alumnus of Imperial (before the merger) he would have denied it, and said he was an alumnus of St Mary's.. surely the way that he defined himself should take precedence, rather than something that happened 33 years after he died. [[User:Zargulon|Zargulon]] 12:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
By your logic, neither HG Wells nor TH Huxley would have been alumni, as they both studied at the Royal College of Science. In fact, I think HG Wells went when it was still called The Normal School of Science. So, you've left us with... Brian May. You also forget that St Mary's no longer exists as an entity, it is simply one campus of the Imperial College School of Medicine.
:I didn't know about Wells and Huxley.. I confirm that, knowing this, I wouldn't describe them as alumni of Imperial College. I am implementing a solution, tell me if it's agreeable. St Mary's certainly still exists as an entity, but, I agree, not as an independent academic institution, I'm not sure where I suggested it did. [[User:Zargulon|Zargulon]] 12:39, 19 May 2006 (UTC)
This is silly. These absorbed institutions are Imperial. The situation is rather unusual, but certainly not unprecedented. Manchester University, for example, was only created in 2004 on the merger of the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST. Their page rightly lists all former alumni of these two institutions as alumni of the newly created Manchester Uni. This is as it should be. They studied at what is now called Manchester, what does it matter what it was called when they went? The same applies here. These former institutions still exist as Imperial. Essentially, it amounts to a name change. My point about St Mary's is that it is Imperial.

==University ratings==

(I'm posting this to all articles on UK universities as so far discussion hasn't really taken off on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities]].)

There needs to be a broader convention about which university rankings to include in articles. Currently it seems most pages are listing primarily those that show the institution at its best (or worst in a few cases). See [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Universities#University ratings]].

=='prestigious'==

Who's the jealous person who keeps removing 'prestigious' from the opening sentence? I'm only going to keep adding it in!

It's not me, but the word makes it seem like the school is compensating for something. If you look at Harvard's page, for example, you find no mention of its international repute in the initial descriptor. Let the place stand on its own merits, not by using hollow words that don't tell the truth of the matter! 
[[User:OPen2737|OPen2737]] 20:03, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

The difference with Harvard is that everyone knows its prestigious.

ps does anyone have a source for the 4th ranking as ive no idea how to add it, and also for the 'only one to have displaced oxbridge'?

That's my point. Being prestigious means that a broad sample of individuals have a high opinion of an institution. Everyone doesn't "know that Harvard is prestigious." Everyone does, however, know that it is very good. An institution may be very good, as I'm sure is the case with Imperial College, but if people don't know it then it is not prestigious. Still, if you want to revert the article, go ahead. I don't live in the UK, so it could be locally renowned without my knowledge.[[User:OPen2737|OPen2737]] 23:03, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

:Question really should be: "where's your source for calling it prestigious?". Unless someone independent of the University and reliable has called the University prestigious, then the word should be removed. Whether it is correct is unimportant if it cannot be verified.

== "Officially" ==

Nothing particularly wrong with it I suppose, but it makes it sound like "Imperial Colelge London" is the unofficial name, rather than what is (as mentioned0 the day-to-day usage.

This is hardly objective. It seems to me that the page is mostly being edited by Imperial students past or present, and that we seem to be in danger of disappearing up our collective arse. I almost suspect Sir Richard to have had a hand in this page.

== Organization of the lead ==

I suggest that the lead ought to follow the flow of the whole article since it's a general summary: intro.& history --> organization & admin. --> academic profile (including research) & student life --> notable alumni. Further, the info. of rankings and associations are currently given undue weight so they ought to be more concise. [[User:Biomedicinal|Biomedicinal]] ([[User talk:Biomedicinal|Contact]]) 09:06, 31 December 2014‎  (UTC) 

I tried incorporating your comments and changes, but I think organization in this new format is less relevant than the previous organization structure.  For example notable alumni is not a whole paragraph in the introduction, other statistics are also important.  I kept the notable alumni as the bottom section as you changed it in structure.  That was a great point.  Like others I think the rankings should be there, and do not understood why they are deemphasized.  Many people have not heard of Imperial globally, and this is their first introduction to the school.  What is it to separate Imperial from any other school in the world they are learning about for the first time.  It is important to emphasize Imperial's importance.

:I see your point but the lead ought to be a concise and precise summary of the article without any undue weight or booster, as suggested by the [[Wikipedia:College and university article guidelines|article guidelines]]. So, I tried to 
:1. generalize all those league tables and draw the conclusion of "top ten within the country" (see the [http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html ARWU] & [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014/reputation-ranking THE Reputation] lists and the three national rankings); 
:2. remove those affiliations in exhaustive details which have already appeared elegantly in the template list nearby;
:3. retain the info. of selectivity and research which also belong to the "academic profile" section where ranking isn't the sole composition;
:4. follow the flow of the whole article, starting with history and ended with alumni; 
:Moreover, I personally avoid using "Imperial" all the time which, in my opinion, a bit clumsy to read through. It's true that the affiliation part can be either incorporated into the research section of the academic profile or the admin. section if they're research associations. But overall, it'll be clearer for the lead to follow the flow of the whole article. [[User:Biomedicinal|Biomedicinal]] ([[User talk:Biomedicinal|Contact]])  05:36, 6 February 2015 (UTC)

I see what you mean by undue weight, that universities should not over emphasize their importance and that neutrality is very important to maintain.  Yet according to the guidelines there is a difference between stating a neutral fact as being ranked 2nd in the world, which the guidelines says is very appropriate and putting excess weight through descriptive adjectives to inflate ones importance. The line Imperial is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, ranking 2nd in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings and 9th in the 2014/15 Times Higher Education World University Rankings is factual as those are global rankings.  It is also ranked 13th in the world by the recent US News and World Report.  This is not an opinion.   Showing the university ranking is what every university does, and is not undue importance.  By hiding the rankings it is diminishing the truth, instead of showing it.  The truth is Imperial has ranked 2nd globally in the QS, 9th in the THE, 13th in US News and World Reports in the world as an institution.  Minimizing Imperial's importance by comparing it to only national universities is diminishing instead of acknowledging facts, and in my opinion is a lack of self esteem, which is required to acknowledge the factual good points in a university and in oneself.  This can be done in a neutral tone.  I kept the line that Imperial is one of the most selective university, which has less facts to correspond with the sentence then the sentence that was removed.  I also think that is a very factual sentence, by the references though.  Harvard universities first sentence says it is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  This is true too.  Yet that is more an opinion than a fact about a global ranking.  I think we need to have the positive self esteem/self regard to be able to acknowledge the importance of an institution, in a neutral and factual tone, instead of minimizing the importance by hiding facts.  Imperial is a global institution.  I am from the United States and chose to attend Imperial because of that, not because it was on a national league table.  Most of the people here have never heard of Imperial.  This is their introduction to a school for the first time.  What separates it from Joe Bloe school no one has heard of too.  It is important to acknowledge the facts of why Imperial got global straight A students to come from all over the world to attend.  Therefore it is important to show the importance of a school either through its affiliations as other schools do in showing there affiliation to the Ivy league, etc.  In every research article they first acknowledge the importance of an idea, theory, or background, before entering into what they are trying to discover.  It is the same with the school.  Many people have never heard of it, and factually this needs to be explained to the many people globally who have never heard of Imperial.   Diminishing these facts is low self esteem and not appropriate to those from outside countries who have never heard of this school and use this page to learn about the institution people attended.
I do think you made very many excellent points, including that the word Imperial was used to much, and this word should be kept away.  I just do not understand the point of changing the structure of the introduction, when it is pretty strong, to something you like better.  I switched the last paragraph to Academic Profile/Alumni you suggested. But it is a lot to change the whole introduction and not expect people to not like many of the changes.  For example one of the sentences that was changed was basically three sentences in a run on sentence.  I have been trying to implement more of your changes now and put them back in.  I was still editing in the process too.  I think you are right that it could be more concise, but the importance of the school for those who have never heard of it globally must be maintained too.  Not only people who look at the national league tables go to Imperial, it also attracts a global student and faculty population.  

Do you really think this sentence you wrote is worded better than the well worded sentence someone else wrote (not written by me): 

Changed: Imperial is ranked among the top universities worldwide by QS where it is 2nd[17] and THE where it is 9th[18] in 2014/15. 
Original: Imperial is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, ranking 2nd in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings and 9th in the 2014/15 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

The changed sentence has poor grammar.  I did not write the original sentence, it is very strong.  Why change a sentence written well?  It is the exact same idea.
The reason why the changed sentence has poor grammar is because acronyms are used, only one date is used, and the citations are mid sentence.  It also does not separate out three ideas, they all flow together.  The ideas are Imperial is ranked strongly worldwide.  It is ranked strongly in the QS and THE rankings.  The date follows the ranking awkwardly, making for one long run on sentence without its ideas separated.

I made the change to the sentence earlier you suggested too.  Structurally for the final paragraph you begin with the most important idea typically. People also end with the most important idea too.  The NY Times valuing graduates is not the most important idea and belongs in the middle somewhere.  It is far more important about rankings or noble prize winners.  This is thus how the paragraph is best to start and conclude .  <small class="auto signed">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.105.91.243|71.105.91.243]] ([[User talk:71.105.91.243|talk]]) 07:20, 6 February 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Sorry if I really made grammatical mistakes. Yet, to be accurate, it's ''QS'' and ''THE (Main)'' of the SAME YEAR (2014/15) that ranked ICL 2nd and 9th respectively, but not ''ARWU'', ''THE (Reputation)'', or ''US News & World Report''. My point is to make the lead concise and precise, thus generalizing all those league tables to draw the conclusion - no intentional comparison and yes it's a fact it's ranked like that. Rankings and affiliations may be signs of esteem but I think the school itself is far more important - if it's really "strong", it doesn't rely on external factors to "attract" international students or faculty. So, you consider "accuracy" (or "details") but what about all those rankings by subjects? Put them all there? On the Harvard page, all those opinions about prestige are generalized into a single statement instead of being listed separately to show what each media said. Not all the Ivies (same as all the "golden triangles" here) are named there either, which are quite irrelevant to the institution itself. I didn't prioritize the info. intentionally. I just though it's more consistent to read. Of course, this is open for discussion. [[User:Biomedicinal|Biomedicinal]] ([[User talk:Biomedicinal|Contact]]) 13:59, 6 February 2015

I took your suggestion and tried shortening it more to make it even more concise.  Everyone makes grammatical mistakes me too. The reality is from an international perspective rankings indeed do draw in the top students and faculty.  Here are two sources showing that: http://www.usnewsuniversityconnection.com/news/use-rankings-attract-top-faculty-students/  http://www.cornell.edu/strategicplan/objectives.cfm According to Cornell Universities strategic plan, " Excellent, highly ranked departments and faculty are crucial to attracting students."  The fact is rankings really do draw a diverse section of international students, faculty, and jobs into the university, and while I am a student and not in the administration, I think it is best to draw the best possible people into the university for all our benefit. I understand that it might seem arrogant to you to list the ranking, but it is not.  It just shows Imperial is a top tier to school.  Others besides me have kept the rankings in there, and so I do not understand why take them out.  I am a top international student and would never have heard of Imperial if not for the rankings, many people like me have never heard of the golden triangle abroad.  We have only heard of Oxford and Cambridge in the United States. When I told two people about applying to Imperial from the United States from my top tier university they asked why apply there?  Then I showed them the ranking and they said, yeah sounds like a good career move.  The fact is many people outside of the UK have not heard of Imperial College and would consider it just another university or a 2nd or 3rd tier school, especially in America, because we have not heard of it globally.  We have also not heard of the golden triangle. We have only heard of the ivy league.  It is important for our careers when other people check out Imperial's Wikipedia that they have a reference point that Imperial is one of the best in the world.  This puts it in perspective factually and without bias.  Yes THE Reputation and US News also rank Imperial as one of the best universities in the world.  US news ranks Imperial 13th in the world and 3rd in europe Above Yale and the University of Pennsylvania.  THE Reputation also ranks Imperial 13th in the world. While there is no point to list every ranking or subject rankings, as this becomes excessive, people who have never heard of Imperial need to understand the universities impact on academics and the rankings are one way to explain that. I understand you do not care about the rankings, but why not leave them in for all the other people who do.  For example even, UC Berkeley uses their rankings too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley.  The rankings are less relevant for people in the UK who have heard of the Imperial and the golden triangle, but is important for attracting international collaboration globally for those who have never heard of Imperial. Maybe we can take out more of the university affiliations section you did not like to make it more concise.  Maybe we can make it more concise and take out the lengthy affiliations section you do not like as a compromise?  And leave the rankings in for the top international students, faculty, who view them as very valuable.  I took out the list of schools in the introduction too as you were right that is not relevant to Imperial's description: Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, KCL in describing the golden triangle.

::I don't deny the role of those rankings, to a certain extent, as measures of progression made by a given institution. Yet, they ought to be shortened and clear without exhaustive details in the lead, which is only the background of the article. As I wrote on the [[Talk:University College London#The lead|UCL talk page]], we have lots of such measures nowadays: ''[http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings-2014/UK.html ARWU (main rankings)]'', ''[http://www.shanghairanking.com/Alternative_Ranking_Excluding_Award_Factor/Excluding_Award_Factor2014.html ARWU (alternative ranking)]'', ''[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2014#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search= QS]'', ''[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/world-ranking/region/europe THE (main rankings)]'', ''[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014/reputation-ranking THE (reputation rankings)]'' & ''[http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-kingdom?int=9cd108 US News (global version)]'', not to mention subject or regional rankings. It can be quite debatable on what to highlight or drop. I think it's enough for a reader to get the general idea of how Imperial is ranked since details are well retained in the corresponding section and most importantly the links within the citations provided (wikipedia isn't a collection of data). I think you may want to have a look on the [[MIT]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] & [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] pages.

I agree 100 percent with your last argument.  I like how you started it, "I don't deny the role of those rankings, to a certain extent, as measures of progression made by a given institution. Yet, they ought to be shortened and clear without exhaustive details in the lead, which is only the background of the article."  I agree 100 percent with what you wrote, and think we made major progress to mutually-agreeable terms.  I think 1 sentence is fine to sum this up.  I think the way that it was written by someone with excellent writing skills (not me) is great, "Imperial is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, ranking 2nd in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings and 9th in the 2014/15 Times Higher Education World University Rankings."  I think that fits your points of being short, with clear grammar.  The sentence is also much better than what I could have written as the writer of the sentance has excellent verbal skills.  Thank you for having this discussion with me, as we both think rankings have importance, and should be short and clear, maybe we can agree on this one sentence, and then leave the rest of the exhaustive subject ranking list for later?  Thank you for having this discussion and for finding mutually-agreeable terms.

== Necessity for subject rankings? ==

I'm not comfortable with the "Global Subject" subsection in the ranking part of the article. Is that necessary to give such undue weight to rankings (especially those European ranks)? Readers can find out more on the cited pages if they're willing to do so. Today, we have many disciplinary league tables with different classification and methodology so no need to list them all here. Simply leaving the overall ranks (beside those listed in the template) with relevant citations is well enough. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia isn't a collection of data]].  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/14.136.68.165|14.136.68.165]] ([[User talk:14.136.68.165|talk]]) 16:31, 6 July 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

Would you rather remove the subject rankings? or add international subject rankings next to them?   I am personally okay with either option.
As an international student, and as imperial is an international school, International subject rankings would seem relevant if we are to include the subject rankings section.  I would strongly disagree with European subject rankings being biased, there is no bias in the rankings (including undue weight).  If anything international subject rankings have more pro-american university bias.  Very few of the top universities in europe are included in international subject rankings, they are all american universities.  If you are a US or international student and want to see how universities outside the US are doing in their respective subjects a Europe subject ranking would seem the most useful statistic for this.
:I meant we should simply leave those overall ranks as people could check for the details (like the positions within UK and Europe) via the citations if wanted. Besides, disciplinary rankings are also redundant since there are dozens of lists released by different ranking agencies, which classify those subjects in different ways. ''[http://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2015 QS]'' and ''[http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities US News]'', for example, have over 20 tables for subject rankings and we, obviously, shouldn't include them all here since [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia isn't a datum collector]]. A general image is enough. [[Special:Contributions/14.136.68.165|14.136.68.165]] ([[User talk:14.136.68.165|talk]]) 05:40, 1 August 2015

== Rankings ==
The rankings are very important in the introduction to emphasize Imperial's reputation as a world class global research university, instead of a local college the same as any other university people have never heard of.  While Imperial is well regarded in the UK, globally such as in the United States almost no one has heard of Imperial College London.  Imperial is a world class institution and some places outside of the United Kingdom, other needs to be made aware of this, so as more top talent, faculty, research funding, and job opportunities are drawn into this institution. As many people have not heard of Imperial abroad, this is their first introduction to the school and their comparison reference point to establish Imperial as not just another local college.   This is the same way research is introduced; the importance of the topic is first emphasized in the introduction.  As others have also said, please keep the world university rankings in the introduction.

-- The wikipedia page is meant to be neutral in format - NOT a promotional page for Imperial College London. In accordance with the wikipedia pages of other British universities, Imperial should not be different just so that it presents Imperial in a better light. Accordingly, I have edited the page so that the {{ Infobox UK Universities }} template present in the wikipedia pages of all other British universities is (which includes Imperial's ranking according to domestic indicators) is seen once again.

---This is biased.... It keeps changing Imperial to skew towards one ranking in neglect of all the rest.  The textbooks, rankings, etc.,  have adjusted in neglect of others opinions, when more than one global ranking of the main four QS, THE, AWRU, and US News represents Imperial.  Imperial is consistently included among the best universities in the world, and it is skewing the results to show it in a more negative light, which is not realistic or accurate.   Yes, the AWRU ranks Imperial 22nd, however this is one survey that grades on Nobel Prize and award winners.  It also only reflects on two subjects, some of which Imperial does not publish in as much as other universities.  In no way do 3 global consistent surveys showing Imperial as one of the best in the world get biased by one survey skewing the result, when Imperial is a technical school focusing on certain subjects.  Please Leave the header sentence alone, you have already changed the infoboxes etc., and frankly this difference is understand neutrality, as the opinion is deflating and not neutral.  Do you think Harvard or any university is #1 on every survey in the world, no of course not.  In no way do all the rankings need to be in the introduction, this is fine in the ranking section, and you have done so.  Imperial is among the best schools in the world and should be left as such.  Please Check out UC Berkeley's wiki introduction please before changing the rankings anymore.  Many schools have both good and bad rankings, and UC Berkeley is not highly ranked on everything either, no school is.  I can understand to change the template, but changing the heading is too much and not neutral, it is painting Imperial in a negative light to reflect one result.  It was not me who wrote please leave the rankings as such in the introduction, but this was removed also so you can paste in your own biased rankings system, which leads with the worst possible ranking (this is often the most meaningful one) and skews the introduction toward one ranking indicator, in neglect of the overwhelming consistent evidence Imperial is among the top universities in the world and consistently in the top 10.  This was the sentence written before, which is very well written by someone else (not by me).  It sounds much better than the new sentence written honestly.  "Imperial is consistently included among the top universities in the world, (please leave the following rankings in alpha-order to ensure neutrality) in 2015 ranking 2nd in the [[QS World University Rankings]] and 9th in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]."  Just having a positive ranking does not mean something is not neutral, it is accurate.   Check out UC Berkeley before making any more ranking changes, and explain to them and all the other universities using a positive ranking as a descriptor that they are not neutral.  It is neutral, it is just one statistic, but it is not neutral to lead with the lowest major indicator, when the other three are pretty consistent, and this one is an outlier.  It belongs in the rankings section, not the introduction.

:: This is absolutely ridiculous. Why should Imperial have its very own rankings template when EVERY other wikipedia page of British Universities includes the standard template of the 3 main global rankings and the 3 main domestic rankings? This is not a matter of presenting Imperial in a negative light, the ARWU is shown first because the template is ordered alphabetically. The page needs to be kept NEUTRAL in format (i.e. the same as it is for every other UK university wikipedia page) to allow viewers to make a comparison. The US News ranking is already included in the text under the Rankings section. Domestic rankings MUST be included in the template. As I have said before, this is NOT a promotional page for Imperial. I suggest you to take a look at the wikipedia pages of every other British University - LSE does poorly in the ARWU however its editors have never felt the need to create an entirely new template to hide that.

---The rankings continue to be revert changes back to how you wrote them, in spite of others opinions in the talk section that we like the proceeding sentence.  I have tried to offer you an olive branch, that you created the new infobox rankings, and just leave the top sentence alone.  You already changed the important ranking infobox, lets settle at that compromise.  I did not like your edits to begin with, but left them anyways, because it is not just my article, but yours too.  This was not my writing, and I personally like other people's sentence more than I like your new sentence.  Please lets just settle at that.  We left the new info box alone, despite others objections, lets leave this sentence alone too. I think that sounds like a fair olive branch compromise instead of a heated war debate, and continuing changing each others edits.

I agree with both of the above statements.  In regards to the first statement: many people do not know of Imperial (especially in the US) and need to know of it as a world class institution, which this article should present.  In regards to the second statement: I agree with the second commentary as well, that this article can be presented this way in a neutral format.  They are both very good points, and both should be used.    For me, I am sorry, but I do wonder, I know there are many infoboxes as ranking indicators, is there a simpler one which could be used, (as I get lost in all the details), it might help others to navigate the page more easily?  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:6003:5900:6DAD:B15C:EE4:B04|2605:E000:6003:5900:6DAD:B15C:EE4:B04]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:6003:5900:6DAD:B15C:EE4:B04|talk]]) 14:54, 6 July 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:I'm not sure whether you two are really two persons since multiple IP addresses have appeared on the history page for the same edit. In short, I'm not eager to argue with you on which league table is better. My point is simple - it's extremely biased to include the two English-world rankings only. You said ARWU was an outlier but what's the definition of an "outlier"? [http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2014#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search= 2] vs [https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2015/world-ranking#/sort/0/direction/asc 9] vs [http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-kingdom?int=9cd108 12] vs [http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html 22] So, which one is an outlier? Imperial's rank on ''QS'' is different from that on ''US News'' by 10, same as the situation between ''US News'' and ARWU. It's more like you're selecting those rankings where Imperial is ranked high (top 10) and I strongly disagree that this is protecting the neutrality of Wikipedia. To show the reader the whole picture, we should either include all, or give a simple summary with references.

::I think there were two people editing this conversation, I was one of the them.   An outlier is when one data point is farther away from the others, and reflects the dispersion of the data.  The spread of the data between 2 and 9 is a difference of 7, and then the difference between 9 and 12 is a difference of 3.  These three points are more clumped up tighter, in their distribution.  The difference between 12 and 22 is a difference of 10.  It is one point that is farther out then the rest of the data.  The farther out a point is from the rest of the data, makes it 1 or 2 Standard deviations away.  The farther away a data point is the less reflective it of the actual data.  Normally when there are outliers, you do not include them.  Also normally you will be working with larger populations of data, but outliers are basically the distribution of the numbers, they measure how far a data point is i.e., how many standard deviations it is away from the rest of the data.    Here is a good explanation on wiki, "For example, if one is calculating the average temperature of 10 objects in a room, and nine of them are between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, but an oven is at 175 °C, the median of the data will be between 20 and 25 °C but the mean temperature will be between 35.5 and 40 °C. In this case, the median better reflects the temperature of a randomly sampled object than the mean; naively interpreting the mean as "a typical sample", equivalent to the median, is incorrect. As illustrated in this case, outliers may be indicative of data points that belong to a different population than the rest of the sample set."  In my opinion the median for this distribution of data, because of the wider spread of the AWRU ranking from the rest of the data (i.e. more standard deviations away), the median of this data set is a better descriptor of the actual Imperial ranking then the mean of the data.  The median of the data is the difference between 12 and 9.  Therefore (12 + 9)/2 =21/2 = 10.5.  10.5 would be the closest descriptor of the real rankings for these prominent global university rankings in my opinion.  I think this discussion belongs in the actual rankings section, not in the introduction.  I think for the introduction if possible take the olive branch, and do the university ranking box (you wished to change to be more neutral in your opinion) and leave the introduction rankings the same.  They are how many universities report there data.... ex: UC Berkeley, University of Edinburgh, LSE, ETH Zurich, where they list the good rankings about the universities.  This is still a very neutral way to describe a university, and please just take the olive branch and do the rankings box, which you changed.  That way we are each doing an important section of the wiki page, and the ranking box was important for you to change, so that way we do not argue and continue this conversation forever, I hope this is a fair way to describe the data.  If you would rather switch roles, I can design the rankings box, and you can take out this sentence about the rankings, but I think you wanted the rankings box as such as you thought it was the most neutral.  Anyways I hope this is a satisfactory agreement, and it is the best I would know how to do in a discussion over a wikipage, as opposed to in person chat.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.83.35.162|75.83.35.162]] ([[User talk:75.83.35.162|talk]]) 01:18, 2 August 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:The spread of the data between 2 (by ''QS'') and 9 (by ''THE'') is a difference of 7 and that between 9 (by ''THE'') and 12 (''US News'') is a difference of 3, right? So, why should we put ''QS'' and ''THE'' in the lead instead of ''THE'' and ''US News'' whose difference is smaller (or in your words "more consistent")? Moreover, that "outlier" may be far more important than the rest of the data and readers will judge all these themselves. To me, this is not a statistical matter of "outliers". Just because others do it doesn't mean we should do so. Dozens of good or featured articles (e.g. [[MIT]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[Duke University|Duke]], etc) don't list specific rankings for introduction, which is an overview of the whole page. Besides, all the pages you cited are tragedy in my eye, especially [[London School of Economics|LSE]] (what a nice school brochure and promotion of ''QS'').

:I did not write that sentence, others have.  At least leave the rankings for others who appreciate it as they are.  If you do not want to take my olive branch suggestion and you do the inbox, and I leave this sentence how others, (not me) have written it, then we will just be editing each others work endlessly.  Can we at least make this deal?  I as well as the other person do not like the infobox you chose, and it is the same as is listed on the infobox website, that they are going to design a new infobox as there have been many complaints about its design.  If you want to leave the infobox as is then leave this sentence as is.  As far as LSE is concerned, they have one ranking by the USNews as an at 328 too, which is also an outlier and does not represent the school.  You are right this is not about accurate rankings for you. At least be respectful to others who want rankings, as this is how the schools who report their rankings list them.    Alternatively we can eliminate the 2 by QS if you feel that would help and just leave the THE you suggested, if you feel that is a better description for you.  That is the best I can do, otherwise we will be changing each others edits continuously.  Keep in mind it was others not me, who said leave the rankings as they are in the text section of the introduction, that was their opinion that they liked it to, how it was written including QS and THE.

I don't have opinion about the design of the universal template unless it breaks the rule of neutrality. The LSE page is another issue. The template doesn't have the result of ''US News'' '''not''' because it is an "outlier" but it was consistent with ''QS'' as the two companies were collaborating with each other previously. Of course, I do agree that we can add the new-launched independent [http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities ''Global Universities Rankings''] to the template to enhance comprehensiveness. I never demand to completely remove information of rankings from the article. However, the lead is a summary providing the general view and shouldn't be dominated by any particular ranking, which is exactly what the LSE page wrongly did. I'd be in favor of leaving the first statement, which is "Imperial is consistently included among the top universities in the world", with citations of ''ARWU'', ''QS'', ''THE'' and ''US News''.

:I am trying to work with you, I will try and change the template to a new version, which is not as clunky, with 4 rankings.  I will include AWRU too, which does not need to be first to be neutral, keep that in mind.  I will include the new US NEWS ''Global Universities Rankings'' as they are more prevalent rankings in America.  I think QS and THE are more common globally, and AWRU is also used for its strong methodology.  I personally do not think AWRU describes Imperial as much, because its rankings only take articles from two subjects, and Imperial focuses on 4 subject specifically, environmental publications in Nature journals and Social Science publications are not really Imperial's specialty as it is a technical school, while Science is included.   There are 4 subjects Imperial looks at.  It will include all 4 of these major rankings though, so thus it will be as neutral as it can be, and there should not be any criticism about neutrality.  I am glad you are okay changing the template unless it breaks the rule of neutrality, which there is no possible way it can by including these 4 rankings, you want to include.  Thus all major global rankings are covered. :)

::Rankings are arranged alphabetically in the template so ARWU comes first. Besides, ARWU is more objective and academic-centered which focuses more on science and technology (Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, etc) and it does represent Imperial College, a technical institution, well.

Ok that sounds good about the template, that you do not have an opinion on  the design.  The template is thus presented neutrally.  I left ARWU (spelled per your change) instead of ARWU World University, as per your change to it.    Overall, I think showing all these four rankings will present all the rankings, and will create a 100 % neutral rankings section per your request.  I think you are right to include ARWU to this section as an objective academic centered ranking, as it is a widely used metric, and it is included accordingly into this template.  All the 4 major rankings are included, so it is neutral, which is what you cared about.

: Imperial is a British University therefore domestic indicators (Times/ST, Complete & Guardian) MUST be included. The ranking you have included is still NOT neutral, you created this template especially for Imperial. Until other Wikipedia pages have specially designed templates for their rankings then the template you edit in will not be approved.

You sparked a very great point, the template should not only include global indicators, it should include domestic indicators too. Imperial is a British University and domestic indicators should be used, this is nothing to do with neutrality, but to use global indicators, but it must include the domestic indicators too.  Excellent point!  Thanks for raising this point.  Yes, this was created for Imperial, and there is no problem with creating a template, it does not need to be a generic template, that many people do not like, and their is discussion on that template page about changing the template too.  The other person above was okay to change the template.  You have made an excellent point, and I think it must be included about domestic indicators.

== Imperial College London is relatively unknown in the United States ==
While Imperial College London is well known in Europe, in the United States at least 97 percent of people (or more) have never heard of Imperial College London.  Many could not separate this school from an unknown community college.  It is important that the introduction establishes Imperial as a world class school, which it is, and that Imperial is consistently ranked in the top 10 schools in the world by several rankings.  As every school claims they are among the best in the world, the introduction does not yet fully show that Imperial is really among the best schools in the world.  For many Americans that have never before heard of Imperial, this webpage will be all they will ever see or hear about Imperial College London, and so the introduction could be more descriptive of Imperial's prominence in the world university scene.  Some Americans have heard of the London School of Economics, and it appears a much better and more important school than Imperial by reading their wikipedia page.  As this is all that many Americans will ever read about Imperial College London, it would be nice if it could improve the introductions importance particularly in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph, where considering every university writes they are among the best in the world, the school seems quite average.  I understand in Europe Imperial is very well known, and considered excellent over there.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:6003:5900:5C38:20F3:DF23:AC5C|2605:E000:6003:5900:5C38:20F3:DF23:AC5C]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:6003:5900:5C38:20F3:DF23:AC5C|talk]]) 05:41, 25 December 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I am guessing around 98 percent of Americans do not know it (just joking, but seriously no one has heard of it.)  I think it is among the top schools in the world by rankings, but from the US in reading about the London School of Economics that appears like a great and much better school.  I hear that Imperial and UCL actually are more solid (besides economics and politics.)  In reading the Wiki's I would have thought LSE was Harvard and Imperial was beneath it.  For those from other countries we are kinda out of the loop at understanding universities in Europe.  What separates this from other universities or community colleges.  The middle paragraph has one sentence about medical facilities built, is there anything else that is notable about the school?  Similar to how LSE has written a few more descriptions and facts (billionaires, research prominence, government positions).  I think overall the introduction is very well written and gives it a strong reputation.  Just when you read wiki's its hard to understand when every school claims they are the best, but why is Imperial higher in many rankings.  LSE sounds like a better school from their wikipedia entry?  Is there a little more that could be added to the middle paragraph maybe to explain Imperial's high rankings?  Trying to understand more about the school, and this is most American's main source of information to learn why Imperial is ranked so highly.  I think maybe another sentence could be added to the middle paragraph or something to clarify for those from other countries.?07:53, 26 December 2015 (UTC)   <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>[[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:6003:5900:3505:166E:11C3:A45B|2605:E000:6003:5900:3505:166E:11C3:A45B]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:6003:5900:3505:166E:11C3:A45B|talk]]) 07:52, 26 December 2015 (UTC)
:I think it is important for Americans to view it as a top 10 institution in the world among others with a high rank.  In America it is not viewed that way, it is viewed as just another college.  I think the only thing to change could be to set a reference point for others outside the UK (particularly in America) to view it to understand Imperial better.  The global college rankings are a good way for others to put into perspective Imperial as a world class school to compare it with other schools they have heard of, and understand that point rather easily and quick.  There are many at top schools (Harvard, Stanford, Caltech, NYU, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, etc., in the US) who have never even heard of Imperial, and would never include it amongst other US top schools in the top 10 because they have never heard of it.  Yet it often is included among top 10 global rankings for the worlds best schools on numerous rankings.  Establishing a reference point by including Imperial's consistent top 10 placement in global rankings will be hugely beneficial from a global perspective.  Thanks for allowing suggestions. <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>

== Well Written Main Article ==
The introduction is great.

The main article could use your help editing, especially if you are articulate.  
Since Imperial is mainly a technical engineering/science university, please be mindful of your strengths and weaknesses in written composition.  This is especially relevant if English is your second language.  Please write with proper grammar.<small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/96.251.26.82|96.251.26.82]] ([[User talk:96.251.26.82|talk]]) 10:23, 24 May 2015</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->

== Male:Female Ratio ==
The [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/P3056.htm Imperial College Factsheet] gives the ratio as 63.2:36.8. Would a better approximation be 6½:3½, or 13:7? This is also the value the Daily Mail uses in its table, 64:36. [[User:M Blissett|M Blissett]] 12:45, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

It would make sense to write this as:  Imperial's student population is composed of more men then woman, with 63 percent of students male and 37 percent of students female.  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/96.251.26.82|96.251.26.82]] ([[User talk:96.251.26.82|talk]]) 10:23, 24 May 2015</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->

== Awesome ==
I found it awesome that both of Prince Harry and Kate's babies were born at Imperial's hospital at Saint Mary's, should the article mention that?

== Suggested additions and edits from Imperial ==

We work in the Communications and Public Affairs Division at Imperial College London. We have some suggestions for improving Imperial’s Wikipedia page, but thought we’d post them here rather than editing, respecting the expertise of existing editors and the potential conflict of interest for anyone employed by the College in updating the article about Imperial. 

We hope these suggestions help. We’d be very happy to try to help find additional sources.

•	Sidebox: The ‘Rector’ is listed as Alice Gast. Imperial has reformed its leadership structure so the ‘Rector’ is now known as ‘President’ http://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/president/.

•	The College also has a Provost, Professor James Stirling. It may be worth mentioning him, following the practice of Wikipedia pages at other universities with a President and Provost leadership model, such as MIT. http://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/provost/

•	Many of the financial figures throughout the page, e.g. on the College’s endowment and research income, are now out of date. The latest annual report may help http://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/finance/public/Annual-Report-2014-15.pdf.

•	City and Guilds College. It may be worth adding that in 2013 Imperial renamed its major mechanical engineering building as the City and Guilds Building http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_19-9-2013-17-17-24. 

•	Under the ‘2010 to Present’ section it might be worth adding more about the Dyson School of Design Engineering, a major new addition to the College.  The entry currently also indicates only one of the School’s courses are on offer.  More background on the School, its background, its courses and its location can be found here: http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/ and here: http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_22-3-2015-23-9-54

•	The ‘White City Campus’ section could note that 600 students (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_23-11-2012-17-0-46) and several start ups and spinouts are already hosted on this site. The Translation & Innovation Hub is scheduled to open in summer 2016: http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_28-1-2016-14-35-44

•	Under ‘Accusations of Ill-treatment of Staff’ the inquest into Professor Grimm’s death has concluded. The review into policies, procedures and support available to staff also concluded in March 2015, accepting all recommendations.  As an action from this the College also reviewed its approach to performance metrics. This concluded in December 2015 and its recommendations were accepted in full: https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/communications/Public/AcademicPerformancemetricseportDec15.pdf?Mobile=1&Source=%2Fcommunications%2F_layouts%2Fmobile%2Fdispform.aspx%3FList%3D13d0d3c5-98bb-4faa-a161-45a4985b71f9%26View%3D4efc9774-cf51-40f2-9a51-92ba9db50670%26ID%3D121%26CurrentPage%3D1

== Major contributions by IP editors ==

An IP editor has been heavily involved in this article over the past year. Your contributions are welcome, but some points I've noticed. 
* Sometimes you have a tenancy to simplify the language used and this can cause grammar issues.  
* Yes, we do need to state this institution is in London, I know its common sense but this is the same format we have for other London institutions as well. Check those pages as well if you aren't sure.  
* Please leave citation needed tags for sections where there are no citations. We need to make sure statements are reliable, someone can come along and find a citation. 
Overall, thank you for editing, I hope you take my comments in good spirit. If we keep working at it then this could become a ''good article''. [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 22:41, 17 July 2016 (UTC)

Thank you, points taken.  
# Keep in mind there are many IP editors, so this feedback only represents one IP editor's thoughts.
# Please use simple language as it emphasizes the important points.
# London, UK should be kept in the first sentence.
# citation needed tags left inside the article

Image addition selections:
I can tell you do not like the picture of the natural history museum as you removed it twice.  Is there another high quality picture to use instead?  You added 3 images, one was of an image already on the page, "St Mary's Hospital."  It was a high quality image so I kept your image and instead replaced the existing "St. Mary's Hospital" image.  You inserted two other images, one was of "Charing Cross Hospital."  I found 3 images of hospitals on Imperial College's page to be quite boring. Imperial is more than hospitals.  Another image was added of Wye College, which is lower quality then the other images on the page.  It also seems like wye college is more of a side point as it no longer is an active part of imperial.  Is there another high quality image to put in its place instead of the natural history museum that would enhance reader interest?  Would a picture of the great albert hall where Imperial holds graduation ceremonies be more interesting? 

I am not the only one making spelling and "grammatical" errors.  (ex: tenancy) ;)
Thank you for your points and editing too!

I simply added #'s next to his points so I could discuss his points by #, I see that was reverted back.  I also changed the title to note that there are a lot of ip editors revising this page, not only one. There is no need for the cited wiki page, as it seems ridiculous, I did not violate anything.  I wonder if there is bias against IP address people. :/

::: I think David was just informing you of this guideline. I understand I was probably wrong and there are multiple Ip's active. Let's get back to the point and talk about the article. I think we need to work on the image choices, the national history museum really doesn't fit here as it is a separate institution and has no relation to imperials history. Royal Albert hall might be a good choice if we have a caption that says this is where graduations take place. Probably too many hospital images are not necessary. The Wye college image isn't too poor, it's definitely part of the history even if imperial closed it. We should try and have images that represent the paragraph they are next to. I think I've tackled most of the citation needed now. [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 10:03, 30 July 2016 (UTC)

:::: Ah ok, you are right.  I was not sure why all my revisions were reverted back.  I had taken that negatively as I am sure many users do as well.  Yes, lets focus on the article.  I agree with you on your suggestions.  That makes sense about the natural history museum not being the best image choice there.  It was also a good idea about the royal albert hall caption.  There are plenty of images inside the royal albert hall of students graduations also, which could be more Imperial specific.  Thanks for adding additional citations.  You are welcome to choose a picture of the royal albert hall if you want or I can as well.  I also think it is ideal to try and have images next to the paragraph they are about.  It may be best to also find photos that enhance our student interest in the institution.   For example, the image of st mary's hospital you inserted in my opinion was an excellent image as it was very high quality and encouraged our student interest and web page engagement.  It was done in a neutral tone.  Imperial has a long history, such that there may be many images to choose from.  There also may be pictures of the royal family and Imperial that might be interesting too.  Just my thoughts.

== Placement in Museum Row and the Rich Cultural Area ==
There is a very rich cultural experience at Imperial being located next to Museum Row, as well as Kensington Palace and Gardens.  It is why I chose to come to the school.  I think this could be more reflected through pictures and in the article a bit more.  I think it is what makes the school as the school is a part of its surrounding context.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/79.73.144.86|79.73.144.86]] ([[User talk:79.73.144.86#top|talk]]) 10:15, 18 September 2016 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

At risk of violating the 3RR, I'm asking whether other edits believe we should have this statement in the lead.
"Imperial is consistently ranked as one of the world's top ten universities". To me, this is misleading as only 2 rankings put the university in the top ten worldwide. In the ARWU it is ranked 22nd and this information is presented further down the article. [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 11:54, 24 September 2016 (UTC)

Yes, I think two other editors (myself included) have thought this was important to include.  I agree with you that it does not belong as the first sentence for the introduction, and do not understand why it would be placed in the first sentence.  As you noted above there are some graduate students from Imperial, like myself, who want to work in the US.  Imperial is virtually unheard of in the United States, and it is very helpful for employers when reading about a school they have never heard of to understand that it is a world leading institution.   In the UK it is relatively known, while where I am from in the US it is virtually unknown. The statement serves as a reference point for employers to understand and compare to US institutions from the US.  I can understand that in only 2 out of 3 main international rankings Imperial has been consistently rated in the top 10 universities in the world. At the same time this is 2 out of the 3 main international rankings that Imperial has been consistently in the top 10 universities in the world!  The sentence is not saying Imperial is ranked as the top 10 university in the world in every ranking, just that it has been placed in the top 10.

QS Rankings consistently placed Imperial in the top 10 for the last 7 years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings
THE Rankings consistently placed Imperial in the top 10 for the last 7 years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Higher_Education_World_University_Rankings
The sentence also includes a citation to the ARWU in case people want more information about the other main ranking.  
Check out ETH Zurich wikipedia, I do not think the sentence is that different.

There was a sentence awhile ago, that someone was more specific for the THE and QS rankings only, if that is preferred.    As a researcher I do think this sentence is overall pretty accurate, but it can be more technically specific if there is confusion about it as innacurate.  I am the second editor to like the sentence, and was not the originator of it.  It is worth noting that the rankings were on this wiki previously and were thought valuable by other users also.  Happy to understand and discuss others opinions as well.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.28.184.90|86.28.184.90]] ([[User talk:86.28.184.90#top|talk]]) 22:22, 26 September 2016 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:::This was an archived discussion on the Talk Page led by Biomedicinal titled Organization of the Lead.  The organization and presentation of rankings was originally a mutually agreed upon resolution found by various reviewers.  I know three reviewers, including the one who posted the idea, me, and Biomedicinal liked a ranking in the introduction and a resolution was thus found.  This is similar to [[ETH Zurich]] or [[UC Berkeley]]. Please refer to the Organization of the lead archived resolution and discussion found.  Biomedicinal had written a similar sentence in the ranking section, which I liked.   If you want to reopen this discussion of what to include in the introduction, I am happy to collaborate with you on this and try to find new mutually agreeable terms if you want to re-discuss that long past discussion and agreed upon content resolution.   <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/47.138.224.15|47.138.224.15]] ([[User talk:47.138.224.15#top|talk]]) 23:17, 4 October 2016 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''No''' The implication by omission of the statement is that all of the rankings agree. This is a failure to present both sides of an argument, and therefore non-NPOV.

'''Proposal for wording'''
* Can I suggest we move to closing this RFC. I suggest we include an updated version of the wording that was previously present (updated because the ranking positions have changed recently). "Imperial is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, ranking 8th in the both the 2016/17 QS World University Rankings and  2016/17 Times Higher Education World University Rankings and 22nd in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities." [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 13:22, 15 October 2016 (UTC)

Good proposal.  I am happy with your updated version of the wording per your idea. It sounds like a good sentence to me, and there is no bias in your sentence, as it includes the three main rankings.   
I tried to keep your proposed idea, and reduce the number of times it shows 2016/17 in the sentence.  You or others may be able to improve the sentence as well.  Your idea is maintained and is a good one.

== Rankings Textbox ==
'''Ranking Textbox Design''' - People had previously complained that the textbox was difficult to read.  I improved the ranking textbox so that it is easier to comprehend by updating the infobox to the world university rankings textbox that other universities have used. I know the topic of rankings can be a hot topic and universities in the UK are especially a hot topic because of their placement within the european Brexit context.  Therefore I added this discussion topic for consensus and discussion.

::: '''Disagree''', I have the same opinion as Aloneinthewild. It makes no sense for Imperial to use another ranking template when every British university in the UK - including Cambridge and Oxford - use the standard UK ranking template. Imperial does not have a strong valid argument to be the exception.[[User:EmyRussell|EmyRussell]] ([[User talk:EmyRussell|talk]]) 00:39, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
'''Lieden Rankings''' - There is not an agreed consensus in regards to Lieden's rankings.  Just because Aloneinthewild and EmyRussell like it, others such as Biomedicinal and myself have questioned the Lieden's rankings.  There was further discussion on this ranking on UCL's talk page.  Biomedicinal had a good idea to synthesize the rankings to just the major ones.  I am not sure why this ranking as opposed to others, such as Reuter's Innovation Ranking (which adds a new dimension to the rankings) or The Ranking of Rankings (a composite of the top 5 major global university rankings or the Round University Ranking would be used.  I personally feel Lieden is a very biased ranking, for example this year it has UC Santa Barbara above Oxford.  There are currently 6 University of California public extremely large campuses who have a large research output because of the size of their school (40,000 students) in the top 20 rankings in the world.  There is a bias against schools with less than 20,000 people.  This for example does not mean that UC Santa Barbara is better than Oxford at research. Moreover there is a great deal of variability in this ranking measure, where it fluctuates dramatically.  The Lieden ranking is not on the US ranking textbox either.  This is not the consensus that Lieden should be used, perhaps there are other rankings that you may want to suggest instead.  Please refer to Archive 2 on the established consensus.
: Hi 64.183.18.235, please see [[Template talk:Infobox UK university rankings]] for the discussion. "I personally feel Lieden is a very biased ranking, for example this year it has UC Santa Barbara above Oxford" - personally, I think your own biasness is showing by making this statement. And upon looking at your edit history, it seems that you have a vested interested in Imperial College London. I would like to remind you to look up [[WP:COI]] closely, Wikipedia is an impartial platform for information to be disclosed.

::: I disagree, and personally feel you have bias against non-user name people.  There is no consensus on this talk page that Leiden should be added, the previous consensus was on using the top three major rankings.  ARWU (which does not favor imperial college), QS, and THE.  I had proposed three other world university rankings systems besides leiden. Yet, there is no consensus leiden should be the additional indicator used here. 

:::Some of my reasons for feeling leiden is biased:

::: 1.    bias against smaller institutions, example Caltech is ranked 172.  Yet, zhenjiang university (45,000 students), university of sao paolo (88,000 students), shanghai jay tong university (43,000 students), Seoul National University (28,000 students), University of Tokyo (29,000 students) are all in the top 10 in this research based measure.
::: 2.    alignment of the rankings to other world university metrics (very far off... for example, University of Sao Paolo with over 88,000 students is ranked 8th in the Lieden ranking and between 100-250 in the QS, THE, and ARWU)
::: 3.    Useful of Ranking (this ranking is not in alignment with any of the other major rankings... ex. 5 of the top universities in the world are from large institutions in china, seoul, brazil, and canada), while typically top research powerhouses are not ranked as highly. (example, zhenjiang university and sao paolo are placed higher than MIT (49), Oxford (13), ETH Zurich (66), or Caltech (172) and few students should base school decisions off of this metric.

:::If you wish to propose other ranking metrics to include, that would be fine, otherwise I think the ARWU, THE, and QS are the rankings used on every other countries world rankings textbox to describe world university rankings.  this ranking has a lot of biases.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:6003:5900:ACDF:7F38:B0B2:2859|2605:E000:6003:5900:ACDF:7F38:B0B2:2859]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:6003:5900:ACDF:7F38:B0B2:2859#top|talk]]) 14:50, 15 June 2017 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
::::[[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 20:53, 19 July 2017 (UTC)I agree with this logic.  The consensus seemed to be to use the three main rankings ARWU, THE, and QS that every country reports.  From archived discussion on the talk page.

== Lead (December 2017) ==

Hi, I've added an extra paragraph to the lead based on affiliations the university has. I've also gone back to the agreed wording of not saying Imperial is in the top 10, as agreed previously on the talk page. Any discussion can take place here.[[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 18:52, 26 December 2017 (UTC)

:Sorry for the added confusion, I was only trying to address the intro in the edits and did not mean to address the main article changes.  Your main article changes were great!!!
:Yes, we can use the agreed upon wording, "I've also gone back to the agreed wording of not saying Imperial is in the top 10, as agreed previously on the talk page."
:I thought the new lead proposed was not written as sharply as the previously written lead, so tried to include two of your proposed changes I thought were excellent - particularly the part about White City, and also a 2nd sentence about alumni could be added that is concise and sharp.  Maybe you or others have ideas for what to include about a 2nd staff and alumni sentence you proposed?  https://www.imperial.ac.uk/alumni/imperial-alumni/alumni-stories/
:I am not sure that a new paragraph needs to be written about affiliations, the endowment and budgeting for a concise introduction.  This is succinctly on the side bar to the right discussing budgeting and the affiliations list.  The intro was previously well written.  Your 2 ideas do seem quite excellent in my opinion about the White City campus and alumni though, maybe we could incorporate those better?  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.80.145.202|76.80.145.202]] ([[User talk:76.80.145.202#top|talk]]) 22:32, 10 January 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:: Apologies, I was a bit quick of the block there. I just didn't expect to be reverted in one edit. It would be best if you discuss here. I can probably leave out the affiliations and financial information. I will make some more tidying edits and we can form an agreement. A few things I will add back, 1) there are missing affiliations, 2) you tried to hide that you had removed the ARWU ranking, this is vital for a balanced view - however much you dislike it ARWU ranks Imperial not in the top 10. we've had a large discussion on this page before - we can have it again if you want, 3) I thought the REF2014 information was clearer before you changed it. [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 23:09, 11 January 2018 (UTC)

::: Yes, that makes sense, and I agree.  #1 In terms of missing affiliations - I did not know I had removed any affiliations, please insert them into the affiliations box.  #2 Yes, I tried to say we could include the ARWU just above on this talk page.  I do not have a problem with that at all, it's fine.  My apologies too for any confusion, and that can stay in no problems.  #3 REF 2014 - that can be made clearer too or reverted back. The article previously had both REF2014 and REF2008 listed so I synthesized them into the most current REF 2014 ranking as there is no point to have both listed.  That was all I was trying to do.

:::Intro changes notes - I think the last version has slightly improved grammar. For example, there is a commma after a year (In 2018, the school was ranked).  Generally, I think the last version was written slightly better by the community, while in my opinion the proposed change is wordier.  Concise writing has a stronger impact.  Many of the previous ideas were already synthesized into their most important elements in my opinion.  For example, I think the alumni sentence has a lot of information in it already (Therefore adding more detail about 5 Nobel prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, 5 in Chemistry, and 5 in Physics may be too much.  This can be read below for more information.). In terms of the other satellite campuses, these are smaller satellite campuses so maybe they do not need to be listed in the introduction summary, as it becomes a run on sentence.  In terms of the four faculties, the word four is unneeded. It is already described by reading the faculties themselves.  The fact that faculties are further divided into additional departments may not be necessary to relate in the introduction, and can be read in the article.  Generally I think it is useful to know that there are faculties of Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Business.  The rest becomes wordy.  Same critiques as we continue with the proposed wording changes, is that the last version was written a drop sharper.  I think we could include the ARWU, as you have desired.  I think we could include a second alumni sentence you proposed, which would be helpful too.  It's just a matter of figuring out what to put into the succinct second alumni sentence.  I think the idea of including white city as a major second campus was a great idea too.  Those changes will make the intro much better!

:::: (Are you {{u|Mikecurry1}}, if so please login and sign your comments) I think it would be better to get further editors opinions as we will go back and forth between the two of us. As for the problems we have, I will cover my thoughts on them below:
::::* I'm a native English speaker so the language is not a problem for me and I can recognise grammar when it is correct. I understand some of my wording my appear "wordy" to those with English as a second language. 
::::* I believe this sentence was better ''Imperial has major campuses in [[South Kensington]] and [[White City, London|White City]] and five other campuses across London.'' The lead should summarise the article - currently it misses the fact there are additional campuses. These are home to Imperial's medical teaching which is quite an important aspect. (also what is an innovation campus?, there are no links, it means nothing to the average reader)
::::*  ''Imperial is organised through faculties of Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Business.'' Using "through" is bad grammar. My proposal - ''Imperial is organised into four faculties - science, engineering, medicine and business - which are subdivided into  departments and centres.'' Ok four may not be necessary, but the subjects should NOT be capitalised. They are common nouns, not [[proper noun]]s.
::::*You removed the dates from the rankings, this is important as the ARWU is not from 2018 but from 2017. The sentence should read as 'it is ranked x by the 2018 THE and QS rankings, and x by the ARWU ranking'
::::* Nobel laureates - ok I can agree it is not necessary. We have a link to the nobel laureates page now which is good.
::::* You have removed all the references from the rankings paragraph referring to the REF. This is bad, information needs to be verifiable by sources - I will revert this and maybe I can include some of your wording.
::::* Also, you removed this "In 2016, Imperial received £2 million to establish a DNA Synthesis and Construction Foundry to accelerate developments in new synthetic biology technologies." Any reason?
:::: I think we are nearly there - thanks for discussing. IF you have a proposal for the alumni sentence please put it forward. I thought it would be good to say that not all of Imperial's illustrious alumni are academics (there are head's of state and politicians). Please understand that I am trying to improve the page so that it reaches a 'good article' standard, all my edits are in [[WP:good faith]]. [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 12:45, 14 January 2018 (UTC)

:::::*That makes sense.  Those are good changes you just made.  Mike Curry made the last edits, not me.  
:::::*As far as your points:
:::::*Yes, it was obvious English is your native language.
:::::*In only my opinion, I am not sure mentioning the satellite campuses are necessary in the introduction.  It depends on what others think.  If you feel mentioning the satellite campuses is important we can include this.  The proposed sentence could possibly be split into separate sentences and definitely made much clearer.  My confusion is that this sentence sounds like there are two main campuses, and then there are also other campuses across London.  I do not think Imperial is like NYU, such that NYU is a campus spread out across New York City.  Imperial is centrally located in South Kensington.  White City is Imperial's new Innovation Campus, and this needs to be separated out from the main campus.  This is because as a reader I would wonder why they have two primary campuses?  The White City Campuses is for Research and Innovation and Spin Out's as well I think.  The other campuses described are medical hospitals in London.  So I think the sentence proposed could be described in two sentences to add clarity to it.  Such as, "Imperial is located in South Kensington.  It also has an Innovation Hub in White City and teaching hospitals across London."  This is not perfect at all, but I think you understand my confusion with the proposed changes for this sentence.  I think the proposed changes could be made clearer.  If desired, we could definitely make this proposed change to expand what is listed as Imperial's campus.
:::::*Mike Curry reverted this sentence change, "Imperial is organised into four faculties - science, engineering, medicine and business - which are subdivided into departments and centres."  Faculties can just be listed without using four.  I am also of the opinion that how these faculties are divided into departments does not add much here for an introduction summary sentence.  It says more being concise here of which subjects are taught.  I did try to improve how the faculties are further divided by organizing your departments created into a textbox in the academics section.  I think this looks great in the academics section, trying to improve upon what you created.  As for the intro I think it is better just more general, these are the main four subjects Imperial teaches, which is obvious when you read it.  Therefore for that sentence something like,  "Imperial is organised into faculties of science, engineering, medicine and business." or "Imperial is organised by faculties of science, engineering, medicine, and business." 
:::::*Agree with you that the REF references should be kept.
:::::*Mike Curry had removed that about a £2 million research grant to establish a DNA Synthesis and Construction Foundry.  You asked for a reason why it was removed and I don't know.  This had never mattered for me personally. One guess is that there are a lot of serious research grants at Imperial, why is just one grant listed?  You can put this back in if you want.  An idea is we may want something about Imperial's research collaborations such as Imperial's collaboration with MIT, similarly to what is listed on Cambridge's Research Section page.
:::::*Mike Curry had removed the dates.  I do agree with him on that.  There were several dates added that are wordy in my opinion too, and the dates are included in the reference already.  You wrote, 'it is ranked x by the 2018 THE and QS rankings, and x by the 2017 ARWU ranking.'  I think just saying the current year rankings are what matter, so 2018 is fine.  I think the focus of the sentence is on the rankings and not on the year.  Having 2 years listed makes the sentence more complicated as you are trying to focus on the various world rankings and not on the dates.  Therefore, I think we could include 2017 from your sentence with something like, 'in "2017-18" it is ranked x in both the THE and QS, and x in the ARWU'.  That way only one date is listed.  I am using a derivation of your sentence, and it is fine including 2017 too.  We may have just needed to list the date once though, instead of twice so the focus remains on the rankings.
:::::*I did personally like the new sentence you added about alumni including heads of state, politicians in the House of Commons, not sure what else should be included?  You had something about CEO's or there are people at the Bank of England, etc. I suggested this website as a good resource: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/alumni/imperial-alumni/alumni-stories/  Maybe we can check what other wikipages have and do something similar that is more for Imperial's distinct background and strengths.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:6003:5900:1C24:7C71:F7EE:8409|2605:E000:6003:5900:1C24:7C71:F7EE:8409]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:6003:5900:1C24:7C71:F7EE:8409#top|talk]]) 00:01, 15 January 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Title (edit warring) ==

The lead sentence is constantly being changed by editors - anon and user accounts. Can we have a consensus on this? One option is that we could put the official title in a ref-note. For other pages with a common article name that differs from the official name - see [[Durham University]], [[Keele University]] [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 17:38, 18 May 2018 (UTC)

== Imperial's influence ==
It would be useful to have something on Imperial's influence in the world and in business.  For example, showing pictures of Stephen Hawking's visit, the Emir of Qatar's recent visit, Imperial's influence in setting interest rates through the Bank of England, or visits by Mayors, President Xi of China, Prince William and Harry, etc.  Imperial is very influential in the world and it would be good to include some pictures of these visits as well as Imperial's influence in areas such as business, in shaping London, influencing Brexit, etc., [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 08:36, 16 August 2018 (UTC)

:I had added some pictures with students and staff meeting with foreign leaders into the global section. [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 20:35, 19 August 2018 (UTC)

== Photos ==
[[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]] suggested to discuss the photos as there were several changes.  Yes, lets remove the image of the meeting room. It showed Imperial's facilities as it was next to the facilities section.  This can be removed.  No reason was given for removing the farmer's market picture; I think Imperial's farmer's markets are a central part of Imperial students lives since the market is centrally located on campus.  Farmer's markets are also on several wiki university pages - for example [[Brown University]].  So perhaps that photo can still be included?  I had added some photos of world leaders such as President Xi or Prince Albert, speaking with students at Imperial, but those were taken down as I did not take that photo for permissions (despite me emailing in), which was disappointing. There are also 2 photos taken of the same building Beit Hall and Quad and 2 of Princes Gardens trees.  I thought generally having one photo of a building or space is preferred so we can show a wider variety of complimentary photos of the university - rather than several of same building taken from different perspectives.  Perhaps we can use either of the two beit hall photos, such as the one you just uploaded? That one looked good.  I viewed the 2 Beit photos as a photo of the entrance compared to the side of the building - and the text is what is essentially different about it as the building has a multiple uses including residence and student union). Perhaps we can use one photo and instead update the text?  There were also 2 photos showing the main entrance, so I had removed one.  I can understand why we use 2 photos here, even though one can be better, if the other is highlighting exhibition road.

: The meeting room isn't exactly a prime college facility - a picture of one of the college-run bars or social spaces, Ethos, or the like might be more appropriate - however, if you feel that it is appropriate until such time as more representative facility photos have been uploaded, then I can see your point. The farmer's market doesn't show it in the context of Imperial, with the easily missable hall in the background not clearly showing its relevance to the college. I don't think that a photo of an open market is particularly relevant anyways, but if it is to be part of the article, then shouldn't it be actually a picture relating the event more to the college, rather than here's some random stall. In terms of the 2 photos involving Beit Quad, I do see your point in terms of two pictures of the same "thing", however, one shows the student hall, which is a different building of the quad to the Union building (the hall making up the south three sides and the Union building separately making up the north side). One is something that only small minority of first years use and most people pass through into the quad (hence its placement in the student housing section), and the other is a central part of the college's social scene. Showing multiple buildings on quads is not that uncommon, however, I do see that they seem to form the same complex. In terms of the Prince's Gardens halls, I definitely see your point, I though the two pictures gave a little different meaning, but just using one is probably for the best. The photo of the main entrance is a little gloomy - it is not meant to be showing exhibition road, but the main entrance itself. I suggest it be left unless a better copyright-free photo of the main entrance (as the focus of the photo in particular) can be found or uploaded, as it is the college's official main entrance, and the main part of the college tourists to the area are likely to see and associate with the college passing by.<sub>[[User:Shadowssettle#Conflicts of Interest|(see conflict of interest)]]</sub>  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 13:40, 3 November 2018 (UTC)
::Proposal: 
::Trying to find ways for agreement between our thoughts, let me know if you think this works?
::Main entrance - keep - new improved photo needed
::Farmers Market - keep - new improved photo needed - photo can relate the market to the outdoor social space that students use
::Facility bulding - remove - replace with a photo of college bars/social spaces
::Princes Gardens - keep
::Beit Quad - keep - use one of the two photos unless the second image is updated which I think would be an improvement.  It appears your inserted image and caption is trying to describe the bar, restaraunt, and club, which I thought was a great idea.  Yet the image is not showing these.  Perhaps if you could take a picture of a bar in beit quad (as you suggested) we could use that rather than a second photo of the building exterior?  For [https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/beit-venues/spaces/bars/five-six-eight example].  Then the second photo would be an image of the bar, restaurant, and nightclub on the ground floor of the Union you were trying to describe with your caption.  Otherwise, I think we should just show the photo from the wikipedia article on beit quad since only one photo is needed of the beit quad building exterior.

::: I think that seems fine, (personally I think the Farmer's market photo should be removed until an appropriate photo has been found, as the current on is not seemingly of relevance). I also think the original photo used for Beit Hall was prefferable to the current one in Student Housing from the Hall's page, can I inquire as to why the change?

::::Sounds good Shadowsettle, lets do that.  There was no reason for the Beit Quad change in photo, it was just the one already used for the [[Beit Quadrangle]] wiki page, so I put it there to also view.  You can choose whichever of the three photos you prefer, they all seem good to me.  I think just one of Beit Quad is preferable unless a second photo shows the interior such as the bar there you brought up.  Any of the exterior photos is fine though, your choice if you think the orignial photo was better than the current ones.  As far as the Farmer's Market photo, we do not need to use that one and it can be removed.  I thought it was nice as it was showing a social part of the school that happens outdoors every week.  It does not need to be used if you don't like it.  Your solution sounds good to implement.  I put a nice picture of Ethos Gym on the facilites section per your suggestion, and removed the meeting room.  Please change the Beit Quad photo to whichever of the two you prefer.  I think we are both in agreement on your solution, and that better photos could be used for the wiki. [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 08:19, 6 November 2018 (UTC)

:::::::::{{Reply to|Shadowssettle}} Thanks for adding a new photo of the Farmer's Market!  I like that.  You also added 2 nice additional photos to the intro.  Check out [[University of Cambridge]] [[University of Oxford]] articles.  These sites do not have as many photos in the history section.  The current photos in the history section are really good too.  Perhaps we could choose one of these two new photos added, such as the new Prince Albert one.  That way the article is synthesized and not more cluttered with photos like Cambridge or Oxford pages who have achieved good article status.  Then we could maybe rotate the photos from side to side or something as those articles do.  Like your last edit a lot and photos!

== Intro changes ==
The previous introduction was well liked by several users.  Many changes were just suggested to the intro at once.  I am including these new ideas here to the best of my ability so we can vote on them and form a consensus. Do you have opinions, [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]], [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]], IP addresses who made these edit suggestions.  In my opinion the previous three paragraph structure was preffered, instead of a new paragraph structure.  What is all of your opinions on these suggested ideas to include (or other intro suggestions)?
*location adjacent Hyde Park
*unique in the Uk, with faculties focusing solely on science, engineering, medicine, and business
*Imperial is best known for the influential nature of its research
*research answers scientific questions and practically addresses global challenges.
*Imperial is one of the most internationally diverse universities in the world, with 59% of its students being from outside the UK, and more than 140 countries represented.
*Sentence about 2016 White City campus in first paragraph.  Since 2016, a new innovation campus has been opening in stages in [[White City]], providing new space for research and collaboration with industry  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikecurry1|contribs]]) 05:45, 14 December 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: Personally I'm fine with how the intro is in general, but I would say the college's focus of study, international diversity and new campus are all relevant facts, whose inclusion might be beneficial. I don't think Hyde Park is particularly relevant at all for an intro, and it is also a few blocks away (the college is actually closer to [[Kensington Gardens]]), so personally I'd be against putting it so high up — it is already covered well in the campus section. The rest reeks a little of [[WP:PUFFERY]] from my perspective, so would caution strongly against their inclusion, lest the intro feel promotional.

: I feel the 2nd paragraph you temporarily (?) introduced feels a little awkward right now, but carries the more relevant information from the changes made by the IP edit. Also, looking over the intro, I'm not sure the laying of the foundation stone for the somewhat unrelated [[Imperial Institute]] (its buildings do not form the college, apart from [[Queen's Tower, London|Queen's Tower]], and the college was not made by the institute) is particularly relevant — should the same be done for the Science and Natural History museums? I would hazard a “no”  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 18:18, 14 December 2018 (UTC)

:: My personal opinion on including these:
# Three paragraphs over two. It follows the pages layout, para1: Intro and history, para2:Campuses and organisation, para3: Academic profile/famous alumni
# Hyde Park, no
# unique in the UK, no - all universities are unique in many ways. This gets too close to puffery
# influence nature of research, might be difficult. Again comes close to puffery. How do you judge influence of research
# Diversity, that could be relevant. I tried before to include a statement on the number of students but I think that was reverted.
# White City, it could be useful to say the campus has started to open.

::: I completely agree, however, I think on point #3: if worded in terms of the university's focus rather than it being unique, then it doesn't seem like puffery  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 19:08, 16 December 2018 (UTC)
::::True, thats works as well. I find the current wording " Imperial is organised through".. a little clumsy. Can we think of a better way to word that sentence? [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 19:31, 16 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::I agree with everything said here pretty much.  I also think the intro is good overall and should be maintained.  We should add Aloneinthewild's description to the Wiki '''paragraph 1: Intro and history, paragraph 2:Campuses and organisation, paragraph 3: Academic profile/famous alumni'''. I agree with Shadowsettle that part of the IP editors edits came across as [[WP:PUFFERY]].  Therefore, I think there is consensus to avoid words like unique, etc.  Per point 5 it seems there is consensus to include a sentence about diversity, such as the one by the IP user that was maintained by Shadowssettle.  In terms of White City that seems important as well and there is also consensus among us to include it. I am okay with White City being in either the first or second paragraph.  It may fit nicely into the second paragraph if we are describing campuses there.  It can also fit in the first paragraph if it is written up as part of Imperials history.  In terms of the first pargarph, I view the part about the Imperial Institute sentence as interesting and being essential to Imperial's history, since Imperial's early foundation was opened by the Queen and developed from there.  Similar with its close relationship and history as being part of Albertopolis as as a science and arts district around those museums.  I think that really shaped the school and its culture in my opinion.  So I think that part should be maintained, as it is essential to Imperial's history since its foundation.  Do you guys have an opinion on the sentence about being part of the University of London and leaving it later, do you think that is still important for the intro, I thought it may not be that important, but was wondering what you guys thought as well?  Perhaps that is a sentence to remove Shadowssettle if you wanted to have the white city part in the first paragraph.  Perhaps White City addition fits in the second pargarph per aloneinthewild's paragraph structure.  Could be either though.  I agree that the sentence about the colleges focus of study that can be reworded too if you guys have ideas for that.  The sentence about diversity included could be reworded also.  Think we are in consensus agreement for the inclusion of White City, the diversity sentence, and rewording the sentence about the colleges focus too.  Thought what ShadowSettle wrote about white city as a general idea was good, not sure how to fit it in yet, first or second para.

| style='border-style: none' | '''''Why?'''''
# Overall I think my problem with the history section of the first paragraph can be collected as: this is meant to be about Imperial, yet the intro focuses more about [[Albertopolis]]. I feel adding an introduction to the formation of the college proper up front before the mention of Albertopolis helps refocus it. I also think the [[University of London]] connection is quite mentionable, as it is a recent-ish event with an institution responsible for the degree awarding for most of the college's life, similar to the [[University of Bristol|Bristol]] article mentioning it was once [[University College, Bristol]]. Maybe also the sentence can be split, but it does all flow.
# I don't see why the foundation of the loosely connected Imperial Institute is so important, most of that was knocked down to form the college, and there is no organisational link as far as I'm aware. However, seeing as people seem to want it, I think it should at least be linked to the college somehow, rather than seemingly hanging there with no connection.
# I feel the incredibly short sentences in the original make it seem like bullet points without the line breaks, especially with them all starting with "In %YYYY" format. Maybe (given change 1) now it's two rather than three in a row of this format, it can be kept as is, but still, maybe change it up somehow.
# I feel this is better, as the White City campus is rather minor, so not much emphasis need be placed on it. I added the bit about Queen's Lawn as it seems to be a thing University pages do, and provides a psuedo-link to more info about the main campus in particular.
# This flows slightly nicer I feel then the jolting short sentence on its emphasis
# I think changing this as suggested to be talking about this making an international student community seems unnecessary, and in some ways [[WP:PUFFERY]] since it is obvious taking in international students will create such, and such wording seems to try and sell it. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's better as is.

:::::::: Hi Shadowsettle, you made a ton of edits. Some of them were quite excellent and a big improvement!  I had incoporated some into the article.  Others were a bit controversial  for me as they were quite bold.  I think in terms of the new intro proposal, I think the biggest contribution of this is to the second paragraphs, which got much better.  I preffered the last version of the first paragraph though before this major rewrite of it though. I view the Imperial Institute and Prince Albert as foundational to the college history, and a predecssor to the current set up of the university. For example, Why do you think the university is called Imperial College London, it is named after the Imperial Institute.  This should help explain the importance of the Imperial Institute.  Similarly, all of the historic buildings, while they took a few years sometimes to get a royal warrant, were part of prince albert's vision for the area of albertopolis as an arts and science center.  Therefore, I tried to incoprorate your changes and the IP editors changes.  So, the first paragraph of the intro I had preffered the previous version though, while the second paragraph edits of the intro were great and implemented.  
:::::::: There were also many edits of the body of the article.  In terms of the body history edits, I think we can primarily use something similar to the history section as written by the school https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/history/college-developments/ and also https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/about-us/history/.  I think it should be kept concise, which improves readability of the article.  This is just in my opinion.

::::::::: I did know the reason for the name, and I do now see where you are coming from mentioning the [[Imperial Institute|institute]], although I think it's important that this be explained, hence the suggestion for adding "on the current site of the college" in my suggested intro. Could you outline your thoughts on the suggested improvements to the introduction, or provide alternatives, so we can work towards a final consensus. For example, what are your thoughts on the inclusion of the Royal College of Chemistry into the introduction — in the proposal given I tried to integrate the information about the Great Exhibition and the colleges.
::::::::: In terms of the changes to the rest of the article, I've tried to avoid using college sources completely to keep the article well-sourced and reliable, however, feel free (as always) to augment the article with further information from the college's timelines. I agree they should be clear, however, this doesn't mean they should be bereft of information, and I feel the history section if anything right now should be expanded - compare the history section of [[University of Bristol|Bristol]] — an institution of comparable age — or the 21st century section of [[University of Warwick|Warwick]]. Both are much larger, granted full of extraneous events, but [[Yale]]'s shows it can be kept to more pertinent details. Seeing as unlike [[History of Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[History of Cornell University|Cornell]], the college is probably not nearly historic enough for it to have its own history page (although [[History of Stanford University|Stanford]] does have one, being of similar age and with only recent rise to such fame along with [[Silicon Valley]]), I do think the history section should probably be relatively comprehensive, although obviously concise and not filled with minutiae.

::::::::: ''Addendum:'' I don't see the need, although I can understand the intent, to remove information from the medical campus section, similar to how the South Ken campus description contains such information. If we are to keep it short, it might be better to actually just list (in a list) them with their facilities, with the short introductory paragraph for their purpose before the list. I also really dislike the [[:File:St_Mary%27s_Hospital_01.jpg|current image]] for [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's]] (just personal opinion, I know), because it just shows a door at a minor part of the hospital, without context.

:::::::::: Hi [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]], I can describe why I preferred that previous paragraph, including three main critiques.  First, that intro pargraph has been very very heavily critiqued and edited with numerous revisions by many editors over the history of this article, so I think that pargarph is probably best to maintain. I think efforts are better spent on the second paragraph because of this.  Second, I think that while some of the buildings were built before the college was created, these were still part of prince alberts vision and patronage.  So they recieved royal warrants soon after they were built, but they are essentially because of his patronage and vision.  Therefore, I thought it made sense that prince alberts vision was the forerunner to the campuses foundation.  I also think the new rewrite has dates that are all over the place, in a way that was harder for me to follow. My recommendation is that the history section of the intro is very well written so there is generally no reason to rewrite that; This 1st paragraph has been very heavily edited and critiqued by a ton of editors so should not be rewritten in my opinion.  The second paragraph of the intro could be improved upon further though.  It has not gone through as many revisions and critiques.  I think you have been doing this.  So effort could be focused on that section of the intro, or on the alumni sentences of the intro.  Editors had proposed these sections could be improved. We could form new consensus on those sentences, that would be an improvement.
:::::::::: In terms of the body history section, I am okay with some expansion and major editing.  I think we should maintain high readability through clean rewriting that is also concise.  I do think Albertopolis and the Imperial Institute were important, though the Queens tower is the last remaining remnant of it.  I think this has shaped the school and its influence, such as setting up the practical curriculum of the school, because of its historic collaborations with industry.  Overall though, in my opinion I think it should be consistent with the university website history section as that is written pretty clean.  You can edit that history section as you like.  Of course, you have been very bold with your edits, so do not feel offended if some edits are liked by the community, while other edits are not liked as much.  
:::::::::: The previous hospital campus version was easy to read and sharply written as it was concise. If you prefer to rewrite this section you can.  I can get behind what you wrote here, "If we are to keep it short, it might be better to actually just list (in a list) them with their facilities, with the short introductory paragraph for their purpose before the list."  Think that would keep it concise and easy to read.    It may be a waste of time to reformat this, as it is currently clean and well written, but you can change the hospital campuses section if you want too.  
:::::::::: The two hospital images were a little crowded on my screen with two.  Lets use the new st mary's hospital image u just inserted then.  I like that one too.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikecurry1|contribs]]) 18:12, 26 December 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::::::::::: No, I understand the reason for removing the second image if the short hospital campus section is to be kept, just not the reversion to the original image. The comment about pulling the Great Exhibition to the top was related to the History section of the article, rather than the first paragraph of the introduction — if you feel the need to include Prince Albert and his vision more up front and early on in the article's history section, please do, but can we keep the [[Great Exhibition]] proper and South Ken later on is all I'm asking. Please do expand the history section — there is much more important information that can be put in the article, such as relevant dates for the important events pertaining to women in the college, the [[Imperial College Union|union]], and expansion, for starters. Also, I turned the hospital campuses into a list — as they're short, it seems wrong to have repeated words just in a new paragraph over and over again — and I have prepared an updated proposal for the top section, based on discussion here

'''Imperial College London''' (officially '''Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[London]], United Kingdom. The college was formed in 1907 from the [[Royal School of Mines]] and the [[Royal College of Science]], with its earliest origins dating back to 1845. Its founder, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], envisioned a cultural area composed of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], [[Royal Albert Hall]], and the [[Imperial Institute]]. His wife, [[Queen Victoria]], laid the foundation stone on the current site of the college for the Imperial Institute in 1888. In 1988, the [[Imperial College School of Medicine]] was formed through a merger with [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital Medical School]], and in 2004, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the [[Imperial College Business School]]. The college left the [[University of London]] in 2007, having been a part of the university since it's formation a century earlier.

<!--Campuses and organisation-->
The main campus is located in [[South Kensington]] centred around [[Queen's Lawn]], with a new innovation campus in [[White City, London|White City]]. The college also has a research centre at [[Silwood Park]] and campuses at the many affiliated hospitals throughout London. Imperial's emphasis is on the practical application of science and technology, and is organised through faculties of natural science, engineering, medicine and business. The college is amongst the most international universities in the world, with 59% of students from outside the UK and more than 140 countries represented on campus.

<!--Academic profile and alumni-->
In 2018-19, Imperial is ranked 8th globally and 1st in London in the [[QS World University Rankings]], 9th in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|THE World University Rankings]] and 24th in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. It was ranked by [[Reuters]] [[Reuters - The World's Most Innovative Universities|The World's Most Innovative Universities]] as the most innovative university in Europe. As of October 2018, [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|14 Nobel laureates]], [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|3 Fields Medalists]], and [[List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation|1 Turing Award winner]] have been affiliated with Imperial College London as alumni, faculty or researchers, in addition to 74 [[Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]], 84 [[Royal Academy of Engineering|Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering]], and 85 [[Academy of Medical Sciences|Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences]]

:::::::::::: Hi [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]], was just editing the paragraph I wrote above, so please read what I just wrote.  We were typing at the same time.
:::::::::::: Read this proposed change.  I think the current version of the first pargarph is still easier to read and cleaner.  The idea of the royal school of mines and college of science is a good one for the intro, but I think the previous intro version includes most of the information in an easier to read way.  I think sometimes we want to rewrite things, but you must realize that this paragraph has been so heavily edited and refined over time, it may not be necessary to rewrite it.  I know you want to leave a mark, so just realize that this paragraph has gone through revisions by many many editors already, and the second paragraph and alumni section is a better focus.  I have included some of your changes to that intro paragraph already.
::::::::::::: Yes, I was just reading though it. I disagree that the first paragraph is great as is, as I have stated before, I find it puts extraneous information pertaining to the formation of [[Albertopolis]] before the information about the college or its predecessors. I agree it is important, but I think a direct statement about the formation of the college's formation through that of its predecessors is more pertinent and should come just prior — this is an introduction's second sentence, not a timeline (although I agree the rest of the paragraph should be kept in date order to keep it sensible), and it is pretty standard to put a foundation date up front, as can be seen in Good Articles of [[WP:UNI]] ([[Yale]], [[Harvard]], [[Bristol University]], [[Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], [[Durham University]]), although I do see the argument that Imperial has history before its foundation, I disagree that this is how the introduction should be formatted. I also have a problem with the sentence "In 1907, the college joined the University of London, before leaving it a century later.", especially since the introduction doesn't clarify that this is when the college was formed (in fact there is no information on the formation of the college, hence my first point of contention). I would guess many editors have dealt with this article, and indeed this paragraph, but that doesn't go to say that improvements can't be made. Also, this has nothing to do with leaving a mark, I don't want my edits here in particular, I've edited many articles in my time and don't care about leaving a mark on any one of them, a would much prefer a consensus — even if it is very different to what I propose — if I can understand the reasoning behind it. It has instead to do with trying to reason why the college article seems to start with minimal information about the college proper or its predecessors (not even a foundation date). Anyway, just my thoughts  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 19:27, 26 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::::::::::: I agree that 1907 sentence could gain consensus for a change. Yes, other editors have dealt with that 1907 sentence in the intro before also.  I had found a similar version to one previously used.  How about "In 1907, the college was granted a Royal Charter and joined the University of London, before leaving it a century later."
:::::::::::::: I have looked at the Good Articles links [[WP:UNI]] ([[Yale]], [[Harvard]], [[Bristol University]], [[Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], [[Durham University]]) you suggested to browse.  I think many of these show who it was founded by (ministers, clergy, Boston elites, grew out of scholars, etc.) I think this is formatted very similarly to how Prince Albert was a forerunner to this university, so I think this is very consistent with these article format.  None of these had a sentence about the early forerunner colleges in their intro, it is about the founders of the university or in Imperial's case prince albert.  So I think that should be maintained and is fine without a major rewrite for the two colleges in this intro.  These are very important in the history section I think.  I also thought the 3 pargaraph format suggested by AloneintheWild is very good and should be maintained too.  It is bold editing to suggest rewriting the intro, switching it to two paragraphs and what not, so please do not take offense that some of the proposed changes were liked and others not.  Keep in mind, your edits have been bold, so some will not have full consenus. For example, I also like the Hyde Park inclusion, while others do not like this in the intro also, so it is not included.  Despite, some edits not having consensus, especially introduction major rewrites, I found your edits to be excellent improvements of the article!!!!  Many of your edits have been implemented.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikecurry1|contribs]]) 20:11, 26 December 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::::::::::::::: I see your point about the other articles. You also misunderstand if you think I take any offence ''(although I do want it clear I am not eager to 'make my mark')'', I just want to make sure I understood why the article is as such. I do think the simple change to the introduce the date as a founding date does seem to improve the first paragraph a lot — I will see if it can do with any tweaking. I also still think it would be better to tie the Imperial Institute construction with the college, through a phrase like "on the site of the college" or "where the college currently stands". Otherwise, I would concur the introduction should probably be left as is.  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 22:41, 26 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::::::::::::: That would be an improvement.  I think the reason the article is as such is because of many editors edits.  Generally, the history section of the intro is in its current form, because many editors had really tore it apart to make improvements to it.  It used to be really bad, and now it is generally well liked, with many editors having had shaped it.  The reason why Albertopolis was emphasized is because I think many people thought Prince Albert was an influential person in Imperial's history, his wife laid the foundation of the Imperial Institute's first stone.  This was the forerunner of the college name.  Prince Albert was instrumental in the early Royal Colleges being "Royal," and the founding of the contextual area around imperial with all the museums.  His patronage gave the imperial institute its early influence and the funding to proceed, as well as luring some scientific researchers.  Some parts of the early universities history were also very negative such as the imperial institute being used to research UK's colonies and their resources, while other parts of the imperial institute established imperial as an influential through excellent research, having an international impact, and its emphasis on practical applications of science in working in collaboration with industry as well.  I think a good summation of the early history of the school is written by the business school website [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/about-us/history/#1540386340565-d8ccc301-fe16] which succinctly describes Imperial's early history around 1851.  Imperial has a very interesting and rich history. <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikecurry1|contribs]]) 23:03, 26 December 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

I thought the history was too much of a summary compared to other university articles, good work on adding more detail. This is an encyclopedia so any relevant information can be used. You are free to suggest any improvements to the introduction, although it has been stable for a while it still can be improved. For example at the moment there is no date of foundation for Albertopolis or any mention of Silwood Park and the hospital sites (I would go and add information about the hospitals).

: Hi Shadowsettle, yes, nice job on the history section.  Great job adding more detail there.  
: Perhaps, you like this 1907 sentence better?  I am erasing the University of London part to include the part about the royal colleges from your suggested edit.  Then it shows the university is being merged with schools who have been around before the formation of the university itself and could tie the imperial institute better to the formation of the school per your critique.  I think it may have too much information to include every history fact in the intro, but perhaps it is better to change that sentence to include what was proposed from your 1907 sentence version. 
: Found this Previous 1907 Version: In 1907, the college was granted a royal charter and joined the University of London, before leaving it a century later. 
: Your 1907 Version: The college was formed in 1907 from the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science, with its earliest origins dating back to 1845.
: Proposed New Merged 1907 Version: In 1907, the university was given royal charter by merging the Imperial Institute, Royal School of Mines and Royal College of Science.

:::::: I'm not sure about saying the Imperial Institute in that sentence, it looks like the [[City and Guilds College]] is the organisation that merged. Am I right in this thinking: Imperial Institute had some research activity (but didn't continue and eventually the building was demolished), this led to City and Guilds of London Institute being formed, this became the City and Guilds College. The history is a little hard to follow [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 14:25, 27 December 2018 (UTC)
::::::: The Imperial Institute was not merged to form the college, rather became known as the [[Commonwealth Institute]], which closed down in 2015, an institution quite separate from the college, except for a decently large shared history. It is also not directly related to, nor the inspiration for, the City and Guilds college, that being the engineering institute planned by the City of London's guilds, although the final site of the CGC was part of the South Kensington development. The Institute's relationship to Imperial is more to do with the shared history rather than anything else (which is why I've always tried to reduce its presence in the article, although I agree now it is something noteworthy). The buildings were even temporarily used by the [[University of London]] at times, yet that is also not formed from the Imperial Institute. The introduction, as it stands at the time of writing this, is thus afaik mistaken. (Please correct me if I'm wrong - I have read a bit on the history of this but may easily be mistaken myself). I also don't see how 1845 was the date when the area was planned out specifically, the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] was founded on a compeltely different site with no original intention to move it or build up an area of any sort in South Kensington, although under the same vision of the prince. I get what the new introduction is trying to do, but it seems to be misleading in many senses as far as I know.

:::::::: Hi Shadowssettle, yes, I believe the Imperial Institute was the reason for the name imperial College London and merged with the royal colleges to form imperial college of science and technology. [https://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-imperial-college-london/][https://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-imperial-college-london/].  City and Guilds College also merged, but I believe the Imperial Institute was more for research.  When the college needed to expand the imperial institute was torn down and moved to become the commonwealth institute.  Two lions remain by the front of the queens tower while the other two were moved to the commonwealth institute.  I was trying to find the Royal Charter, originally granted under Letters Patent in 1907. for a much better source, but unfortunately it is no longer online.  I think (but am not sure it was in the original charter from 1907).  Only the more recent royal charter with the college of medicine is online, where the imperial institute was torn down already.
:::::::: You are correct in terms of the 1845 date. I do not think it was when it was planned per se, I do not know the date of the planning. It was the date when one of the royal colleges was built more technically.  I was trying to add an 1845 date for you though somewhere (and the royal colleges to the same sentence too) because of your critique that the early constituent colleges date was not included.  I had thought that sentence may be a good place for the initial date if you had a suggestion.  These were the vision of Prince Albert around that time.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikecurry1|contribs]]) 19:20, 27 December 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

No, I get why the date was put in there as it was to try and link the date and the founding of the colleges and area, it just claimed that was when the area was started, which is not the case (I believe it was done by the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]] after the exhibition) and I don't think the introduction should be misleading.
In terms of the institute, I cannot find where it says what you think on the link you gave — "The Imperial Institute and several Royal Colleges (which would later merge to become ICL)" I believe is talking solely about the colleges merging, and all of them being built, otherwise it goes against every other source I have come across (see the citations in the History section), including the well sourced Wikipedia article on the Institute. Also, the Institute clearly didn't merge, it was kept a completely separate endeavour until 2015, not even being renamed until 1958. Just because the site was shared, doesn't mean that they are the same, as I have stated the [[University of London]] used the Institute's site as its home between 1900 and 1937. I'm not trying to be problematic, I'm just trying to make sure we actually go with the facts — if you can find sources (hopefully not with clickbait titles?) that prove any form of merger, then sure, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 19:33, 27 December 2018 (UTC)
:Hi ShadowSettle, that is fine in changing the date to 1851, I was asking for your suggestion on the date.
:For the Imperial Insitute, I have not seen any sources that say they clearly didnt merge.  I was under the impression they did in the 1907 royal charter.  Could you please inform me of your sources for that?  Also, I do not think it is true that it was an institution seperate from Imperial that just sat on its side.  Please explain how Imperial College London got its name from an insitutition sitting just on its side that is seperate from the school.   The imperial institute was part of the university of london as was imperial.  I think the source for this is Imperial's 1907 royal charter, not the new 2007 royal charter.  We can take out the imperial institute from that sentence if you prefer (as your original sentence had it), as it is very hard to source accurate information about the institute.  i think it was from that royal charter in 1907 by the king though. The previous not good source I found quickly was, 5 things you did not know about Imperial College London, where under a heading It was founded by Prince Albert as part of Albertopolis, "The Imperial Institute and several Royal Colleges (which would later merge to become ICL)[https://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-imperial-college-london/]."  I am pretty sure it was part of it, thats is why I was suggesting the 1907 royal charter as a better primary source.  At the same time, sourcing is very hard and the history of the school indeed can lead to confusion.  I do not think they were seperate though, thus the namesake Imperial, which makes common sense.  Also the Imperial Institute is listed on the university history webpage, although I wish it was in more detail to further clarify these things.
:Hi Aloneinthewild, Yes, you are correct that the city and guilds building had merged also.  i think this was a part of the same 1907 royal charter.  Also that the Imperial institute had some research activity and did not continue being demolished.  The city and guilds building was a different building than the Imperial Institute.  It was also demolished and is where the business school now stands.  Indeed, the history of the school is a little harder to follow, and I wish that it was written up better.  Thats why I think the university resources should be used for the body to describe its history so that everyone is on the same page, [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/history/college-developments/].
: Hi ShadowSettle, I know you are techically accurate which I appreciate.   I agree with you on the date, that is more technically accurate.  I am trying to understand your sources for the Imperial Institute?  Where are you getting that information.  I think you are factually accurate, and that way we can get on the same page.  There is currently some confusion, so I am trying to understand better your perspective as well, so we can be on the same page on it.
:: My problem is I think you may have the wrong understanding about the facts of the events, but I don't want to be rude at all, and ''I may myself be mistaken''.
# The [[Imperial Institute]] '''''was not''''' part of the [[University of London]], not ever. They did share the same site as far as I know from 1900 and 1937. A quick search confirms no reference to them ever being the same institution, and it is never referenced on the institutes Wikipedia page.
# The institute was also '''''not''''' merged into the college, rather the site on which in sits, and possibly some of its mission (I don't know, and wouldn't put in in the article without sources saying it '''did''' happen), were taken over by the college, and they share some history (hence why I agree the institute deserves mentioning in the introduction)
# The City and Guilds College was not merged in 1907, rather 3 years later (see citations in the article's history section or  [https://web.archive.org/web/20121002165842/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/CityAndGuildsCollege.aspx click here]). As I do not know where I can find the 1907 charter, I am unaware if this was mentioned then, or later. In the intrest of representing what is known, I suggest we keep away from any statement suggesting it did merge in 1907.
:: Please don't ask me to prove something ''didn't'' happen (although with the Institute it's pretty easy to read up on the citations from the [[Imperial College London#History|history section]] and the [[Imperial Institute|institute's article]] to see that it is a very separate entity) claims in articles must be backed up, so what is claimed did happen is what needs to be referenced.

::: I thought your revert to the previous version was fair until we can further clarify.  
::: My problem was that I thought you were suggesting rewriting the intro and history section based on an incomplete understanding of the history.  For example: you did not know the Imperial Institute was important to Imperials history, yet there is a reason it is the colleges name.  That is why I suggested to clarify for both of us, so we can get on the same page.  I have attached technically accurate facts regarding the points you just listed.
:# Point 1, Imperial Institute '''''was definitely'''''  a part of the University of London.  It's in the [[Commonwealth_Institute]] Wiki.  It is listed there in describing the Imperial Institute.
:# Point 2, I finally found additional information as a source for the Imperial Institute being part of the college from the [[University of London]] wiki.  "The Imperial Institute Building in South Kensington, home to the university from 1900 to 1937."  This should explain the imperial institute more.
:# Point 3, you are correct that the city and guilds college moved later. At the same time, it was also in the 1907 royal charter too. 
:# Point 4, I am not sure what we are arguing about.  I think we are both just trying to get on the same page with the facts, so sources will help as well as clarifying assumptions. Best, [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 22:53, 27 December 2018 (UTC)

::# No, it doesn't say that anywhere, and my reading would suggest it wasn't (could you please state where you think the Commonwealth Institute article states as such????)
::# Yes, they shared the same site between 1900-1937 (as I stated, this is not new information) however, as Univ. Londin. physical presence (excl. colleges) was not very big, just the offices for the federated system, this wouldn't have taken over the entire buildings I wouldn't think, as the Institute didn't move out until much later ([https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp220-227 source]). This however doesn't prove any institutional system.
::# You might be right, it would be useful to have access to a copy of that — right now I have no sources (what is needed to put anything in an encyclopedia article) to indicate either way, if you have some, I'd love to see them too. 
::# Can you please give your sources for your claims overall, I'd like to see them, and do you see [[Russel's teapot|why]] I'd prefer sources to prove things did happen
:: The facts as far as I'm aware:
::# The Imperial Institute was related in terms of the shared South Kensington program, and sharing the same site. The reason for the sharing of the name can only be presumed by common sense: They share the same site and history, so it was named as such? One was integrated into the other? I would say probably to the former, most unlikely to the latter (the Commonwealth Institute article doesn't state this anywhere, I don't see where you're looking?), but without sources, I wouldn't say either in an article.
::# The City and Guilds college joined in 1910. ([https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp233-247 source]) Was it part of the original charter? I don't know — without a copy, or a reliable source ''clearly'' stating is was (rather than nonchalantly stating it was merged) I would not want to put whether it was in the charter in the article.
:: So, keeping the introduction to what we can agree on, and what facts we do have, I'd give the following suggestion, keeping as much to the current one as possible:

:: Please could you read the proposal in the context of the facts I have given, and provide the reasons you don't like it (no hard feelings on my side, I'm already expecting problems with it though), maybe provide your own proposal I'll find problems with? ''(I'm not happy with how the UoL bit reads in the proposal, but rewording it might change the proposal too drastically, any suggestions?)'' Also feel free to provide sources for what you have said, and slay what I believe to be facts as they ride on their steed.  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 23:10, 27 December 2018 (UTC)

:::I think we can do something similar to your proposal for that 1907 sentence to include the royal colleges you thought were relevant there.  Yeah, the UofL bit, I think lets just leave the university of London part out, where a sentence could be in the history section.  It was not in the intro b4 this either. I think if I were reading the intro I would feel overwhelmed with facts, so the royal colleges part sounded better to include how you wrote it.  We could include your 1907 sentence as you wrote it.

:::In terms of the city and guilds college, yes, it was incorporated into the royal charter in 1907. [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] example: "In 1907, the latter two colleges were incorporated by Royal Charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907,[4] but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910."

::: So I think that 1907 sentence can simply list the three schools "[[Royal College of Science]], [[Royal School of Mines]], and [[City and Guilds College]]."  That way the intro would not need to add this additional fact of the 1910 added complication, as I think the added detail also fits better into the body's history section. 

::: I am fine with your 1907 sentence and think that could be included as such.  I think the UofL sentence would be better in the history section of the body as I do not think it is needed in the intro if we are including the royal college part, and it has not been in the intro for along time anyways. Also, to consider I did like Aloneinthewild's 1907 sentence version which I thought also read very well.  I will show you two version of his sentence to consider for this sentence too.  Any of the three sentences yours or his would work for me.  

::: Aloneinthewild's sentence was "In 1907, the college was granted a [[royal charter]] incorporating the [[Royal School of Mines]] and [[Royal College of Science]]."

::: We could do something similar to his sentence if you prefer to list the City and Guilds College also.

::: "In 1907, the college was granted a [[royal charter]] incorporating the [[Royal School of Mines]], [[Royal College of Science]], and [[City and Guilds College]].

::: So you can choose any of the 1907 sentence's you prefer and insert any one into the wiki for further editing. :) [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 02:53, 29 December 2018 (UTC)

::: The second sentence proposal sounds quite reasonable to include the royal colleges there also in that sentence.  We may want to lead that Prince Albert proposed a district for arts and science instead of a cultural district as it sets up the museums and colleges following it, but either way works.  Please input the royal colleges from your edit of the second sentence into the wiki too.[[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 03:05, 29 December 2018 (UTC)

:::: Whilst I disagree that "... In 1907, the latter two colleges were incorporated by Royal Charter into the Imperial College of Science and Technology and the CGLI Central Technical College was renamed the City and Guilds College in 1907,[4] but not incorporated into Imperial College until 1910." coming right after " on the site were the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. ..." shows any involvement of the [[City and Guilds College|CGC]] in the 1907 royal charter, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121002165842/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/CityAndGuildsCollege.aspx source it quotes there] actually does imply they merged ''(so we have found a source to back this up! It is one I had read earlier for writing the history section (and cited there), but only for its 19th, rather than 20th-century implications)'', so we can state that with references that it was merged (although we definitely ''can't'' say it was incorporated, as this relatively reliable source clearly states it wasn't). In terms of wording, I am generally ambivalent as long as the meaning is accurate, so if {{User|Aloneinthewild}}'s variant is preferred, then good (as long as it's slightly corrected) "In 1907, the college was granted a [[royal charter]], ''merging'' the [[Royal School of Mines]], [[Royal College of Science]], and [[City and Guilds College]]<ref>{{cite-web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002165842/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/CityAndGuildsCollege.aspx|title=City and Guilds College — Imperial College|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|website=architecture.com}}</ref>". As all three editors currently discussing this seem to be fine with this variant, I have gone ahead and integrated it into the article. {{done}}
:::: On a separate note, I'm glad we seem to be agreed on that nothing shows that the Imperial Institute was either part of UoL or had any kind of incorporation into or with the college, and that we can show that City & Guilds did at least in some form merge with the college in 1907, as you'd suggested. I'm still looking for better language on trying to tie the Imperial Institute sentence ''("His wife, Queen Victoria, laid the foundation stone for the Imperial Institute in 1888.")'' into the article more, right now it reads a little jolted, seemingly unclear on how it fits in with the rest of the article, but I haven't thought of a nice way of rewording it yet. I also think maybe adding a "..., and in 2007 the college left the [[University of London]], having been a member since its foundation." might help to try and incorporate the UoL into the introduction in a less prominent place, keeping the event to something in the correct timeline order.
::::: I'm happy with that wording Shadowssettle, thanks for your research to clear this up [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]] ([[User talk:Aloneinthewild|talk]]) 12:48, 29 December 2018 (UTC)
::::: Yes, I'm also happy with the wording Shadowssettle, and we have formed a good consensus by all three of us for this first paragraph change. When people try to edit this later we can cite this consensus.  I think there are a lot of facts in the intro's first pargarph now.  So to make it easier to read for some people who are not as technical, we maintain the level of facts as is without adding more facts, and thus keep the new royal college sentence we have consensus on and we don't use the UofL in the intro which was not there anyways for a long time - that could be described in the body's history section.  We both tried the UofL in the intro as a test, but we were both not happy with it our tests in the intro, and we both like the royal colleges better now in its place, so it can better fit in the body.  Also, if you want to change the second sentence per your proposed change with the royal colleges you are welcome to implement your proposed change for that if you want.  It is not adding anything new topic as it is discussed in this 1907 sentence so is not adding additional facts in my opinion, so you can put this in per the proposal if you want.  In terms of the Imperial Institute sentence you can improve it to make it less jolted if you can do so.   Part of it though is I think there is a little confusion of the Imperial Institute's place in Imperial College London's history besides granting the university its name.  It's important to consider the significance of founder, the Queen, as other good articles also state the founders and royalty who inspired the school. [[Columbia University]], [[McGill University]].  Besides that I am not sure what to do with that sentence, and it sounded interesting to me as it was.  If you can improve that sentence you are welcome too.  You are welcome to propose changes to the first pargapraph if you want?  I think rather than spend time on the first paragraph, the second and third paragraph probably could use more work as they had not been discussed as much.  We had made some improvements on the second paragpraph quickly.  There were two consensus agreements I know of in these paragraphs, the diversity sentence (we just made) and using the three rankings. In the third paragraph it was previously suggested that the alumni sentence could be improved.  Would either of you have any ideas for that alumni sentence on what to write for this sentence?  [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 17:54, 29 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::: I added the 2nd sentence proposal from Shadowsettle for the first paragraph about royal colleges. Let me know if you prefer this version, which may smooth the joltedness or the previous version by connecting the thoughts of the royal colleges and imperial institute in the next two sentences.  Either this version or the previous works for me. Best, [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 17:54, 29 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::: I also think it may be possible to switch the words for a date in the second sentence, "Its founder" to "In 1851" per AloneintheWild's excellent edit.  I have found some sources for this.

Organised by Prince Albert and Sir Henry, it was the first international exhibition of manufactured products and was extremely influential on art and design education. Profits from the event were used by the Royal Commission of 1851 to purchase a group of objects that became the founding collection of the V&A and also to buy a plot of land south of Hyde Park. It was on this land that Prince Albert and Sir Henry’s ambitions to develop a campus of museums, colleges and educational institutions that promoted the arts and sciences was realised."  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mikecurry1|contribs]]) 19:11, 29 December 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:::::::: I don't particularly like the 1851 format, he probably envisioned it before then, when exactly we couldn't say, it's the date of the Exhibition, but I like how that is now. On the other hand, I think moving the [[Imperial Institue]] to the end of the list is great, it does make it flow better (I think it could be better but it's a small but very noticeable improvement).  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 21:08, 29 December 2018 (UTC)

::::::::: Glad you think that improves the flow.  Then if that is the case that he we do not know the exact date he started thinking about his vision, we could probably edit that sentence slightly so it is accurate per your point.  We could write something in the sentence like he began building his vision then in 1851 rather than his vision was in 1851.  I thought Aloneinthewild's idea was to write the date of the founding of Albertopolis in the article, which I thought was a good one.
::::::::: Also, to explain why I wrote the grammar as such without the words several and some words capitalized as I know you are into technical accuracy.  I have attached sources as well.  The capitalization of the word royal can be quite confusing.  The words Royal Colleges and Royal Charter are capitalized as they are a King or Queen's order or act.  Orders, Acts, and laws are capitalized such as in Royal Decree No 24. (Section 3.38)[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-5.pdf] This is noted online in the capitalization of spelling in the Cambridge Dictionary - [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/royal-charter] and on UK government sites  [https://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/royal-charters/].  Also, the word several b4 Royal Colleges is not needed since it is not doing much as an adjective, since the "s" at the end of the word colleges denotes there are more than one college, so the adjective becomes redundant.  This creates for more concise writing, which is one of the pillars of good article status you noted. I hope that this helps explains why I had the grammar as I did there, which I think is technically accurate for the intro.

::::::::: Hey [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]], I was just noticing in the history section you wrote the orgins were in 1845, could we use that date for the sentence?  That would be consistent with the Royal College of Science
:::::::::: Yeah, looks good what you wrote in the second sentence, perhaps we should use 1845, which is the consistent prince albert started the royal college of science (per your history section).  We could use your citation for that from the history section. Cheers, [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 18:14, 30 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::::::: I was thinking about it and began what? It needs another word following it, rather than just began, as it is unclear what he began.  Perhaps, instead of began, built or another word?  I think "began upon building his vision for".  I also did like the word its founder in that sentence, as I believe I added that word in a long time ago to the sentence as a descriptor.  At the same time, I think Aloneinthewilds edit to incorporate the year is cleaner, and better explains historical timing, while keeping that sentence concise, so it superseeded that word I added.  Similarly, your royal college edit is much better than the last version of the intro.  Perhaps:

:::::::::: In 1845, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] began upon building his vision for a cultural area composed of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[Royal College|Royal Colleges]], and the [[Imperial Institute]]. (citation - shadowsettle from history section - 1845 college of chemistry[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry/about/our-history/chemistry-at-imperial/])

:::::::::: I tried to incorporate the edit you wrote, and also this edit with began upon building, but neither looked as good.  Perhaps we can think of another idea if needed, but I thought it was written well by AloneintheWild in his previous version and maybe we are just beeing a little too picky in critiquing this intro.

:::::::::: The last sentence edit is combining two seperate ideas, which creates a run on sentence.  I think it is easier to read as two sentences.  Yes, I agree with your smart critique that it is a little monotonous and perhaps that could be improved.  Overall I think the second and third paragraphs need more attention though then the first (which has been more thoroughly hashsed out over time) as I have been trying to suggest, where there is probably more room for more significant improvements per our time such as our new diversity sentence.  

::::::::::Wish we were editing this in the same room as it would be easier.

::::::::::: That's not accurate, the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] was one of the prince's endeavours, but to begin with not anything to do with the developments in South Kensington, originally located at [[Hannover Square]] near [[Oxford Circus]]. Thus it's not accurate to claim this as a date for the South Kensington development. Could we keep that as is, using 1851 for the South Ken development is fine. Also, I don't see you're problem with "begin" on its own. "I began the presentation". "The programme begins at 9 o'clock". To me it reads fine? 
::::::::::: If you do want to use the 1845 date, we could do something along these lines

::::::::::: otherwise can we keep it to the 1851 date, which is accurate for Albertopolis, whereas 1845 isn't (although arguably 1850 might also be accurate with the foundation of the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851|1851 Commission]] that year).  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 21:18, 30 December 2018 (UTC)
:::::::::::: Yeah, we can use 1851. It sounds good after your edits.  We are both being a little overly picky.  I am also not sure what the problem was with Aloneinthewilds sentence as he wrote it.  It sounds like you are still thinking about those few words, "work on his vision," if you or anyone thinks of a preferable way to say that we can use that.  It sounds good as you have it.

:::::::::::: I liked the new second paragraph changes we were making.  Several sentences and ideas were added (diversity sentence, focus of the university, hospitals), I am just cleaning up the grammar a bit.  So you are aware of the reasons for the edit, the first sentence is a bit of a run on sentence currently where there are two seperate ideas.  I also dont think any use of a park was agreed on for the intro; I think Hyde Park adjacent would be prefereble because it is an international landmark for an encylopedia, but currently we do not have consensus for a parks use.  The second sentence could be more concise in explaining Imperial's hospitals, per good article guidelines.  My edits are very minor fixes on grammar, and maintaining your central ideas added we agreed on. I just thought I would explain the edits here, so you do not take the edits personally.  Overall, I liked the new ideas for the second paragraph and so I am just cleaning these ideas grammar up for their implementation. [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 22:49, 30 December 2018 (UTC)

:::::::::::: In the third paragraph and edit was created to say and 1st in London.  Before it read (1st in London).  I think in the middle of a very long sentence listing global rankings  "and 1st in London" without parenthesis sounded clunky and awkward.  I thought perhaps we should take out that part about 1st in London.  Do you have an opinion?  If the sentence has 1st in London, I think it would be easier to read in parenthesis, though I am not sure it is needed to say 1st in London this sentence anyways.  I think it reads cleaner this way after our new international diversity sentence too to focus on global rankings. Let me know if you have an opinion on this.

:::::::::::: I think our edits and discussion made a big improvement on the intro overall [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]], [[User:Aloneinthewild|Aloneinthewild]], so it is reading much better now. [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 23:29, 30 December 2018 (UTC)


::::::::::::: Can I firstly try to make it clear I don't think I take things personally, it's just that a lot of changes recently just miss the truth, which I try and fix. As long as there are no semantic changes, and the writing is not in noticeably poor taste, I don't mind too much, unless I have a good reason. If you find your minor wording edits were seemingly reverted by me, it is possibly because they came in a stream of edits including some which began to mis-portray the exact nature of the facts, and I reverted to an earlier version.
::::::::::::: I agree "work on his vision" may have a better way of being put, but I don't quite know what that is. The majority consensus right now I believe, looking at {{User|Aloneinthewild}}'s comment from long ago and considering my opposition, is not to include the parks here in the article. I mean, there are already more important things that are being excluded for the sake of brevity and conciseness – the parks are quite peripheral. Also, would you expect the universities of Cambridge or Durham's articles to include parks not institutionally connected to the University this high up, or any other university article at this level to cover it in the main intro? Landmarks aren't necessarily important for this kind of article, did you know that Kensington Palace is just up the road too? Should all articles about institutions focus the introductions much on what is around than what the institution itself is? Here's the silly extreme I can take this point to, just for fun, but I hope it shows my concerns, if exaggerated ''*slightly*''... ''(please don't take offence, I'm just going to the far extreme here to show why I don't like including random attractions nearby in an article of an independently important institution like this, and also note I am happy with the article's introduction as is. Yes the following will be a poor taste [[strawman argument]])''

::::::::::::: It seems like it detracts from the point of the article, to cover facts about Imperial not the neighbourhood, when we're already putting museums this high up. Parks are already covered in the campus section which is where I agree they probably should be covered. Focus should probably move to other parts of the article right now. Can I also ask that you refrain please from saying things like "so you don't take it personally" and "make your mark", which can come across as implying I'm not grounded in my edits and looking to win. If you make grammar edits, feel free to just leave them in your edit summaries, or just say why you did them here. I have never presumed anything of the sort of you in my responses, and have been clear when I was trying to just get the facts straight or if I thought there was a disagreement to that end, and seeing as my edits have all been in cause of good reason, mostly factual, I hope you can see how such comments may be construed as a possibly a little bit of something like a [[WP:PA]]. I don't really mind, and take in good faith such a implication was entirely unintentional, but I would prefer it if you kept away from those kinds of suggestions, without good reason. Thanks.

::::::::::::::That was a great edit Shadowssettle!  Sorry, if you took that as a personal attack, I just meant so you don't take it personally, because you noted boxing match.  I just said so you dont take it personally, because you just inserted 3 sentences into the second paragraph, and my grammar edit was reverted (probably unintentionally during the course of those edits).  So I did not want you to take it personally that I was editing the second paragraph where you recently added too, just that I was trying to edit the grammar of the whole pargraph generally.  It was also late at night during the edit, so that may have made one or two words off in my talk page statement I wrote quickly, but it was not meant to be personal at all.  I am sorry, if you felt that was a personal what I said.  I normally speak with I, you, we in person, rather than in 3rd peson. I never meant that as an attack, but it is probably hard for me to express my tone over writing too.  Nothing personal was meant. I am honestly sorry about that.  Honestly, I think you have been doing really great editing, and am happy that you have made the intro and article much better through your edits and photos and our discussions!!!  So if anything I would want to say thank you very much!!! [[User:Mikecurry1|Mikecurry1]] ([[User talk:Mikecurry1|talk]]) 00:53, 31 December 2018 (UTC)

I had presumed that it was probably me misreading tone into it, and know its hard to convey tone across text, taking what you'd said with good faith, just wanted to clear it up. Think we should probably wrap up this particular discussion then, if there's not much else to discuss and no objections. Feel free to make more improvements to it at any time as always, there's still a bit that could maybe be done better, we can open a new topic with more specific scope if anyone's edits become controversial (this one has dragged along quite a bit). It's good we've come to a consensus on a better introduction, I hope we can all be glad we are all been able to come up with something we all think is a good improvement  [[User:Shadowssettle|Shadowssettle]]<sub>([[User talk:Shadowssettle|talk]])</sub> 01:08, 31 December 2018 (UTC)
:Yes, sorry again if that was miscommunicated late at night.  It was probably hard for me to convey tone over the wiki, and maybe the tone was not understood as I meant to say it in.  Yes, it could be improved further, but it is much much better because of your editing.  I think you have been doing great and am very happy with your excellent edits!

:::Also, what is your opinion for the alumni sentence? Should we include something from the wiki article that is different that is more practical than what is listed there currently, such as from the graduate employment prospects or entrepreneurship?  "According to both the 2016 Guardian University Guide and the Complete University Guide, students were ranked as having the top employment prospects among UK universities.[87][88]" or there is a line about New York Times graduate prospects.   Check out [[Stanford University]], [[MIT]], [[Caltech]] alumni section of their leads.
::::I checked out the palace of westminster article after you attached that, and the articles current lead was intersting.  I can see that your attachment of this was originally meant as satirical and funny, and an intro like the palace of westminster like the one attached would clearly not be supported for an encyclopedia. Since then that articles lead is very good and has a nice geographical context.  Perhaps we can include some context geographically too here?  (such as the one below.)  Would you have ideas about what would be more appropriate to include if we were to include a geographical context?

::::: Fair, but, I have realised the overall problem with the choice of such article. The comparable article would actually be the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], for that is the institution, whereas a [[Imperial College London#South_Kensington|South Kensington Campus]] article would be more comparable to the actual buildings. Also, if for example Hyde Park, or a notable river, ran right through the middle of the college, or the college was built overlooking the park (and thus the park played an instrumental role to the design and construction, and the life of the college), then I could see why, but it's a nearby park, nothing more. If the article on the [[University of Cambridge]] had a mention about it being built along the [[Cam]], then that would make sense – many colleges lie on, or [[Queen's College, Cambridge|across]] the  river, and a lot of [[Mathematical Bridge|famous university sights]] lie along the river (as do the [[Houses of Parliament]]). However, Hyde Park has no constructional link and its not part of the campus, it's not even the closest notable park, [[Kensington Gardens]] is closer to the campus (see maps). Yes, there are a few union clubs whose websites indicate they use the parks, but I would argue the parks are far from central to an introduction. I would strongly argue the parks should be kept to the campus section. If we put something like Hyde Park in, should we also put closer Kensington Gardens, which has a slightly stronger claim for inclusion from my perspective (still not a good claim though, I don't think), what about [[Kensington Palace]] as well? Suddenly this isn't an introduction to the university, but an introduction to [[Albertopolis]] (with the inclusion of the museums already).  Also, should we include [[Queen's Lawn]] (again) and Prince's Gardens? These actually do form part of the college, and looking at imagery and statements in this article, one can see that they're quite important to the social life (the later around which 800+ rooms of college accommodation lie). I believe they could, they're part of the college and important to it's social operation. (not arguing for their inclusion, but I think they're more central to it that the parks mentioned earlier). So now we have an article introduction talking mostly about parks. Yes, this is a classic [[slippery-slope argument]] (so not to be taken too seriously), but I do believe putting Hyde Park in is further down the list of important things to include then most of the other ideas just mentioned. So can we just keep that to the South Kensington Campus section, please?
::::: In terms of the alumni prospects suggestion, I think that sounds fine, although looking at the other articles, they've provided slightly more concrete facts (money, or based directly on percentage in PhD courses). I don't know and don't mind, and I think it should be okay, but also okay not to – you could probably put something in now and if anyone objects then discuss.

::::::Ok, yeah, it seems like there may be more important things than geography to include.  
::::::In terms of improving the alumni part, I'll see if I can find something and that can be adjusted.  I'll probably aim more towards the mass entrepreneurship the campus does from the article or student graduate prospects, unless there are other ideas.

:::::::The reason I removed turing is because I used the universities page for facts and figures of awards. [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/introducing-imperial/our-people/award-winners/]. Of course, turing is an important award yet since only 1 turing award was won historically, it is not that distinctive about the school.  So I just used the universities award winner list about how they describe the school as preferable.

:::::::::Hi Shadowssettle, Do these articles help you think of a better word choice?  As you said yourself the current word choice suggested was not that good.  I just want the proposed change to be preferable to the original version already there.  Then I am okay with it.  Currently I think think the original version is preferable, but I am very open to your thoughts on this to make it as accurate as possible.  It may be accurate enough for a summary too, considering synthesis is never quite as completely accurate as the full detailed explanations.
