science]] that studies [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] and
[[celestial event|phenomena]]. It applies [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and
[[chemistry]] in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and
phenomena and their [[chronology of the Universe|evolution]]. Objects of
interest include [[planets]], [[natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s,
[[nebulae]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[comet]]s; the phenomena also includes
[[supernova]] explosions, [[gamma ray burst]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[blazar]]s,
[[pulsar]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. More generally,
all phenomena that originate outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's
atmosphere]] are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct
subject is [[physical cosmology]], which is the study of the [[Universe]] as a
whole.{{cite

one of the oldest of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in
[[recorded history]], such as the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]],
[[Greek astronomy|Greeks]], [[Indian astronomy|Indians]], [[Egyptian
astronomy|Egyptians]], [[Nubians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Chinese
astronomy|Chinese]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and many ancient [[indigenous
peoples of the Americas]], performed methodical observations of the [[night
sky]]. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as
[[astrometry]], [[celestial navigation]], [[observational astronomy]], and the
making of [[calendar]]s, but professional astronomy is now often considered to
be synonymous with [[astrophysics]].{{cite

Astronomy and the Solar System|date=2001|pages=6–9}} Professional astronomy is
split into [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical
astronomy|theoretical]] branches. Observational astronomy is focused on
acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then
analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented
toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe
astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with
theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and
observations being used to confirm theoretical results. Astronomy is one of
the few sciences in which amateurs still play an [[citizen science|active
role]], especially in the discovery and observation of [[transient
astronomical event|transient events]]. [[amateur astronomy|Amateur

discoveries, such as finding new comets. ==Etymology== [[File:SLNSW 479519 16

However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related
to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics. Some
fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also
astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on
this subject may use "astronomy" and "astrophysics," partly depending on
whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department,
and many professional [[astronomer]]s have physics rather than astronomy
degrees. Some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include

cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]] ===Ancient times=== In early historic
times, astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the
motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early cultures
assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In
addition to their ceremonial uses, these [[Observatory|observatories]] could
be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to
plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.Forbes, 1909 Before
tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was
conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in
[[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology
in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese
astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya
civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and
ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy
consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now
referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the
motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the
Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to
be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating
around it. This is known as the [[geocentric model]] of the Universe, or the
[[Ptolemaic system]], named after [[Ptolemy]].{{cite

was mostly stagnant in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe, at least until the
13th century. Nevertheless medieval Europe housed a number of astronomers who
made a progress. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336) made major
contributions to astronomy and horology, including the invention of the first
astronomical clock, the [[Rectangulus]] which allowed for the measurement of
angles between planets and other astornomical bodies, as well as an
[[equatorium]] called the ''Albion'' which could be used for astronomical
calculations such as [[moon|lunar]], [[sun|solar]] and [[planet]]ary
[[longitude]]s and could predict [[eclipse]]s. [[Nicole Oresme]] (1320–1382)
and [[Jean Buridan]] (1300–1361) first discussed evidence for the rotation of
the Earth, furthermore, Buridan also developed the theory of impetus
(predecessor of the modern scientific theory of [[inertia]]) which was able to
show planets were capable of motion without the intervention of angels.Hannam,

modern science. Icon Books Ltd, 2009, 180 [[Georg von Peuerbach]] (1423–1461)
and [[Regiomontanus]] (1436–1476) helped make astronomical progress

later. [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Astronomy flourished in the Islamic

the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the
Enlightenment), the Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social
support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions. Among
the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.J.L. Heilbron, ''The Sun
in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar Observatories'' (1999) p.3 ===Scientific

astronomical chart from an early scientific manuscript, c. 1000]] During the
[[Renaissance]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] proposed a heliocentric model of the
solar system. His work was defended by [[Galileo Galilei]] and expanded upon
by [[Johannes Kepler]]. Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly
described the details of the motion of the planets around the sun. However,
Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote
down.Forbes, 1909, pp. 49–58 It was [[Isaac Newton]], with his invention of
[[celestial dynamics]] and his [[gravity|law of gravitation]], who finally
explained the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the [[reflecting
telescope]].Forbes, 1909, pp. 58–64 Improvements in the size and quality of
the telescope led to further discoveries. The English astronomer [[John
Flamsteed]] catalogued over 3000 stars,Chambers, Robert (1864) ''[[Chambers
Book of Days]]'' More extensive star catalogues were produced by [[Nicolas
Louis de Lacaille]]. The astronomer [[William Herschel]] made a detailed
catalog of nebulosity and clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet
[[Uranus]], the first new planet found.Forbes, 1909, pp. 79–81 The distance to
a star was announced in 1838 when the [[parallax]] of [[61 Cygni]] was
measured by [[Friedrich Bessel]].Forbes, 1909, pp. 147–50 During the 18–19th
centuries, the study of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Leonhard Euler]],
[[Alexis Claude Clairaut]], and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] led to more
accurate predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was
further refined by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]],
allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their
perturbations.Forbes, 1909, pp. 74–76 Significant advances in astronomy came
about with the introduction of new technology, including the [[spectroscope]]
and [[Astrophotography|photography]]. [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] discovered
about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859,
[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars
were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of
[[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es, and sizes. The existence of the Earth's galaxy,
the [[Milky Way]], as its own group of stars was only proved in the 20th
century, along with the existence of "external" galaxies. The observed
recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the
[[Universe]].{{cite book|author=Belkora, Leila|title=Minding the heavens: the

Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as
[[black hole]]s and [[neutron star]]s, which have been used to explain such
observed phenomena as [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[blazar]]s, and [[radio
galaxy|radio galaxies]]. [[Physical cosmology]] made huge advances during the
20th century. In the early 1900s the model of the [[Big Bang]] theory was
formulated, heavily evidenced by [[cosmic microwave background radiation]],

and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done
at shorter wavelengths. Although some [[radio wave]]s are emitted directly by
astronomical objects, a product of [[black body radiation|thermal emission]],
most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of [[synchrotron
radiation]], which is produced when [[electron]]s orbit [[magnetic field]]s.
Additionally, a number of [[spectral line]]s produced by [[interstellar gas]],
notably the [[hydrogen]] spectral line at 21 cm, are observable at radio
wavelengths. A wide variety of other objects are observable at radio
wavelengths, including [[supernova]]e, interstellar gas, [[pulsar]]s, and
[[active galactic nuclei]]. ===Infrared astronomy=== {{Main|Infrared

Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of [[infrared]]
radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our
vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold
to radiate visible light, such as planets, [[circumstellar disk]]s or nebulae
whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can
penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of
young stars embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and the cores of galaxies.
Observations from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) have been
particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic [[protostar]]s and their
host [[star clusters]].{{cite

is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself
produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories

optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is the oldest form of
astronomy.{{cite book |author=Moore, P. |title=Philip's Atlas of the Universe

|isbn=978-0-540-07465-5}} Images of observations were originally drawn by
hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made
using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors,
particularly using [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) and recorded on modern
medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000
[[Ångstrom|Å]] to 7000 Å (400 [[nanometre|nm]] to 700 nm), that same equipment
can be used to observe some [[near-ultraviolet]] and [[near-infrared]]
radiation. ===Ultraviolet astronomy=== {{Main|Ultraviolet astronomy}}
Ultraviolet astronomy employs [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between
approximately 100 and 3200 Å (10 to 320 nm). Light at those wavelengths is
absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these
wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.
Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and
spectral emission lines from hot blue [[star]]s ([[OB star]]s) that are very
bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies,
which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects
commonly observed in ultraviolet light include [[planetary nebula]]e,
[[supernova remnant]]s, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet
light is easily absorbed by [[interstellar dust]], an adjustment of
ultraviolet measurements is necessary. ===X-ray astronomy=== {{Main|X-ray
astronomy}} [[File:B30727.jpg|thumb|X-ray jet made from a supermassive black
hole found by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, made visible by light from the
early Universe]] X-ray astronomy uses [[X-radiation|X-ray wavelengths]].
Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by [[synchrotron emission]] (the result
of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), [[bremsstrahlung
radiation|thermal emission from thin gases]] above 107 (10 million)
[[kelvin]]s, and [[blackbody radiation|thermal emission from thick gases]]
above 107 Kelvin. Since X-rays are absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], all
X-ray observations must be performed from [[high-altitude balloon]]s,
[[rocket]]s, or [[X-ray astronomy satellite]]s. Notable [[Astrophysical X-ray
source|X-ray sources]] include [[X-ray binaries]], [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova
remnant]]s, [[elliptical galaxies]], [[clusters of galaxies]], and [[active
galactic nuclei]]. ===Gamma-ray astronomy=== {{Main|Gamma ray astronomy}}
Gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by
satellites such as the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] or by specialized
telescopes called [[atmospheric Cherenkov telescope]]s. The Cherenkov
telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the
flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's
atmosphere.{{cite

ray|gamma-ray]] emitting sources are actually [[gamma-ray burst]]s, objects
which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of
seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient
sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, [[neutron star]]s,
and [[black hole]] candidates such as active galactic nuclei. ===Fields not
based on the electromagnetic spectrum=== In addition to electromagnetic
radiation, a few other events originating from great distances may be observed
from the Earth. In [[neutrino astronomy]], astronomers use heavily shielded
[[Neutrino observatory|underground facilities]] such as [[SAGE (ruSsian
American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]], [[GALLEX]], and [[Kamioka
Observatory|Kamioka II/III]] for the detection of [[neutrino]]s. The vast
majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the
[[Sun]], but 24 neutrinos were also detected from [[supernova 1987A]].
[[Cosmic ray]]s, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei)
that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result
in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current
observatories.{{cite book |first=Thomas K.|last=Gaisser|date=1990

Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets
and stars has been essential in [[celestial navigation]] (the use of celestial
objects to guide navigation) and in the making of [[calendar]]s. Careful
measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding
of gravitational [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]], and an ability to
determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a
field known as [[celestial mechanics]]. More recently the tracking of [[near-

Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the
results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation of
a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several
alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the
phenomena. Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into
account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's
results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the
model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large
amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a
model. Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: [[stellar
dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[Galaxy formation and
evolution|galaxy formation]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-
scale distribution]] of [[matter]] in the [[Universe]]; origin of [[cosmic
ray]]s; [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string

outer surface of the Sun is called the [[photosphere]]. Above this layer is a
thin region known as the [[chromosphere]]. This is surrounded by a transition
region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated
[[corona]]. At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of
sufficient temperature and pressure for [[nuclear fusion]] to occur. Above the
core is the [[radiation zone]], where the plasma conveys the energy flux by
means of radiation. Above that is the [[convection zone]] where the gas
material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas

convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots. A solar
wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the
outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the [[heliopause

gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of
matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The [[radiation pressure]] of the
[[solar wind]] then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those
planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets
continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of
intense bombardment, evidenced by the many [[impact crater]]s on the Moon.

Ejecting gas from the dying central star shows symmetrical patterns unlike the
chaotic patterns of ordinary explosions.]] {{Main|Star}} The study of stars
and [[stellar evolution]] is fundamental to our understanding of the Universe.
The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and
theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the
interior.Harpaz, 1994, pp. 7–18 [[Star formation]] occurs in dense regions of
dust and gas, known as [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]]. When
destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to
form a [[protostar]]. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger
[[nuclear fusion]], thus creating a [[main-sequence star]]. Almost all
elements heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were
[[nucleosynthesis|created]] inside the cores of stars. The characteristics of
the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive
the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its
hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is
completely converted into helium, and the star begins to [[Stellar
evolution|evolve]]. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A
star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward
while increasing its core density. The resulting [[red giant]] formed by the
expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the
core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of
evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.Harpaz, 1994
The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater
than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse [[supernova]]e;Harpaz,
1994, pp. 173–78 while smaller stars blow off their outer layers and leave
behind the inert core in the form of a [[white dwarf]]. The ejection of the
outer layers forms a [[planetary nebula]].Harpaz, 1994, pp. 111–18 The remnant
of a supernova is a dense [[neutron star]], or, if the stellar mass was at

189–210 Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the
"[[metallicity|metals]]" produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar
medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be

{{Main|Galactic astronomy}} Our [[solar system]] orbits within the [[Milky
Way]], a [[barred spiral galaxy]] that is a prominent member of the [[Local
Group]] of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other
objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is
located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way
that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a
bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a [[supermassive black hole]] at
its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core.
This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger,
[[Stellar population|population I]] stars. The disk is surrounded by a
[[Galactic spheroid|spheroid halo]] of older, [[population II]] stars, as well
as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as [[globular

[[Galaxy groups and clusters|groups and clusters of galaxies]]. Finally, the
latter is important for the understanding of the [[large-scale structure of

elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of an [[ellipse]]. The stars
move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These
galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and
generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core
of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large
galaxies. A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually
with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that
spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which
massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically
surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our
nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.
Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor
elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar
shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction. An
active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy
from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact
region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting
radiation from in-falling material. A [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy
that is very luminous in the [[radio]] portion of the spectrum, and is
emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter
frequency, high-energy radiation include [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]],
[[Quasar]]s, and [[Blazar]]s. Quasars are believed to be the most consistently
luminous objects in the known universe.{{cite

in [[molecular cloud]]s, although they may also appear in low temperature
stars, brown dwarfs and planets. [[Cosmochemistry]] is the study of the
chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements
and variations in the [[isotope]] ratios. Both of these fields represent an

planets is needed. * Is there other [[Extraterrestrial life|life in the
Universe]]? Especially, is there other intelligent life? If so, what is the
explanation for the [[Fermi paradox]]? The existence of life elsewhere has
important scientific and philosophical implications.{{cite web
