Current adversarial methods directly alter pixel colors and evaluate against pixel norm-balls: pixel perturbations smaller than a specified magnitude, according to a measurement norm. This evaluation, however, has limited practical utility since perturbations in the pixel space do not correspond to underlying real-world phenomena of image formation that lead to them and has no security motivation attached. Pixels in natural images are measurements of light that has interacted with the geometry of a physical scene. As such, we propose a novel evaluation measure, parametric norm-balls, by directly perturbing physical parameters that underly image formation. One enabling contribution we present is a physically-based differentiable renderer that allows us to propagate pixel gradients to the parametric space of lighting and geometry. Our approach enables physically-based adversarial attacks, and our differentiable renderer leverages models from the interactive rendering literature to balance the performance and accuracy trade-offs necessary for a memory-efficient and scalable adversarial data augmentation workflow.', 'keywords': ['adversarial examples', 'norm-balls', 'differentiable renderer'], 'authorids': ['hsuehtil@cs.toronto.edu', 'mtao@dgp.toronto.edu', 'chunlial@cs.cmu.edu', 'derek@cim.mcgill.ca', 'jacobson@cs.toronto.edu'], 'authors': ['Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu', 'Michael Tao', 'Chun-Liang Li', 'Derek Nowrouzezahrai', 'Alec Jacobson'], 'TL;DR': 'Enabled by a novel differentiable renderer, we propose a new metric that has real-world implications for evaluating adversarial machine learning algorithms, resolving the lack of realism of the existing metric based on pixel norms.', 'pdf': '/pdf/028ad7abd781d3e1afab67b9fbbb6f6b8645839f.pdf', 'paperhash': 'liu|beyond_pixel_normballs_parametric_adversaries_using_an_analytically_differentiable_renderer', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\nliu2018beyond,\ntitle={Beyond Pixel Norm-Balls: Parametric Adversaries using an Analytically Differentiable Renderer},\nauthor={Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu and Michael Tao and Chun-Liang Li and Derek Nowrouzezahrai and Alec Jacobson},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJl2niR9KQ},\n}'}		SJl2niR9KQ	SJl2niR9KQ	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	747	HJxED7A_YQ	['everyone']		['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']	1538087859915		1549252335192	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

To alleviate this issue, we propose a marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) to suppress the dominant response of the most salient regions in a principled manner. The MAAN employs a novel marginalized average aggregation (MAA) module and learns a set of latent discriminative probabilities in an end-to-end fashion.  MAA samples multiple subsets from the video snippet features according to a set of latent discriminative probabilities and takes the expectation over all the averaged subset features. Theoretically, we prove that the MAA module with learned latent discriminative probabilities successfully reduces the difference in responses between the most salient regions and the others. Therefore, MAAN is able to generate better class activation sequences and identify dense and integral action regions in the videos. Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of constructing MAA from $O(2^T)$ to $O(T^2)$. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets show that our MAAN achieves a superior performance on weakly-supervised temporal action localization.\n\n\n', 'keywords': ['feature aggregation', 'weakly supervised learning', 'temporal action localization'], 'authorids': ['yuanyuan910115@gmail.com', 'lv_yueming@outlook.com', 'shenxiluc@gmail.com', 'ivor.tsang@uts.edu.au', 'dyyeung@cse.ust.hk'], 'authors': ['Yuan Yuan', 'Yueming Lyu', 'Xi Shen', 'Ivor W.

While the derivation may still appear complicated and heavy in notation, the actual implementation is in fact rather straightforward.\n\nAntithetic sampling for variance reduction is indeed old. However, antithetic sampling only becomes useful after performing variable augmentation and REINFORCE in the augmented space; without the Augment and REINFORCE steps, it is unclear how antithetic sampling can be applied to binary variables. \n\nCategorical extension of the binary ARM estimator involves much more sophisticated variable-swap and merge operations (much more notation heavy).

An empirical way around this issue is to use a straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013) in the backward pass, so that the ""gradient"" through the modified chain rule becomes non-trivial. Since this unusual ""gradient"" is certainly not the gradient of loss function, the following question arises: why searching in its negative direction minimizes the training loss? In this paper, we provide the theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question. We consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We shall refer to the unusual ""gradient"" given by the STE-modifed chain rule as coarse gradient. The choice of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the expected coarse gradient correlates positively with the population gradient (not available for the training), and its negation is a descent direction for minimizing the population loss. We further show the associated coarse gradient descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss minimization problem. Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE may lead to instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is also observed in our CIFAR-10 experiments.', 'paperhash': 'yin|understanding_straightthrough_estimator_in_training_activation_quantized_neural_nets', 'keywords': ['straight-through estimator', 'quantized activation', 'binary neuron'], 'authorids': ['yph@ucla.edu', 'jianchel@uci.edu', 'shuazhan@qti.qualcomm.com', 'sjo@math.ucla.edu', 'yingyong@qti.qualcomm.com', 'jxin@math.uci.edu'], 'authors': ['Penghang Yin', 'Jiancheng Lyu', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Stanley Osher', 'Yingyong Qi', 'Jack Xin'], 'TL;DR': 'We make theoretical justification for the concept of straight-through estimator.', 'pdf': '/pdf/09778adc0ac035fb3ff537cb0a0a1162ecb2842b.pdf', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\nyin2018understanding,\ntitle={Understanding Straight-Through Estimator in Training Activation Quantized Neural Nets},\nauthor={Penghang Yin and Jiancheng Lyu and Shuai Zhang and Stanley J.

An entity pair (A, B) is analogous to (C,D) if the same relation holds between (A, B) and (C, D). They train a Siamese-network based binary classifier over representations of entity pairs which predicts whether a given instance of two entity pairs is analogous or not. The entity pair representations are computed by embedding sentences in which a pair occurs (assuming distant supervision). The method is evaluated on traditional as well as one-shot relation extraction tasks.\n\nStrengths\n1. The paper is generally clearly written.\n2. The approach is simple and the results are reasonable.\n\nComments\n1. The paper seems to suggest (page 3, last para) that USchema approaches don't handle unseen relation types. This isn't completely accurate considering that USchema has both row-less and column-less variants (Toutanova et al., 2015; Verga et al., 2016, Verga et al., 2017). When combined (Verga et al., 2017), these are capable of generalizing to unseen textual relations and entity-pairs. \n2.

Experiments were conducted on standard KB completion tasks using images as entity representations instead of one-hot vectors, as well as a zero shot tasks using unseen images of unknown entities.\n\nOverall I think that enriching KBs with visual data is appealing and important. Using images to query knowledge bases can be a practical tool for several applications. However, the overall experimental setup suffers from several problems. The results are overall very low. In the non-zero shot experiments I would like to see a comparison to using entity embeddings, and maybe even using a combination of both, as this is the more interesting setup. For instance, I would like to see whether using images as additional information can help building better entity representations. The explored link prediction models are all known, so apart from using images instead of entities there is very limited novelty. The authors find that concatenation followed by dot-product with relation-vector works best. This is very unfortunate because it means that there is no interaction between h and t at all, i.e.: s(h, r, t) = [h;t] * r = h * r_1 + t * r_2. This means that finding t given h,r only depends on r and not on h at all. Finally, this shows that the proposed image embeddings derived from the pretrained VGG16 model are not very useful for establishing relations.\n\nGiven the mentioned problems I can unfortunately not recommend this paper for acceptence.\n\nOther comments: \n- I wouldn\'t consider a combination of pretrained image embeddings bsaed on CNNs with KB embeddings a ""novel machine learning approach"", but rather a standard technique   \n- redefine operators when describing LP models: \\odot is typically used for element-wise multiplication, for concatenation use  [h; t] for instance\n- (head, relation, tail) is quite unusual -->  better: (subject, predicate, object)\n- baselines are super weak.

Modeling the combinatorial label interactions in MLC has been a long-haul challenge.

However, the sequential nature of modeling label dependencies through an RNN limits its ability in parallel computation, predicting dense labels, and providing interpretable results. In this paper, we propose Message Passing Encoder-Decoder (MPED) Networks,  aiming to provide fast, accurate, and interpretable MLC. MPED networks model the joint prediction of labels by replacing all RNNs in the encoder-decoder architecture with message passing mechanisms and dispense with autoregressive inference entirely.  The proposed models are simple, fast, accurate, interpretable, and structure-agnostic (can be used on known or unknown structured data).

Following, this resource is automatically filtered to identify triples over named entities (using an automatic NER system, yielding a corpus of 104M tuples), and only entities which match entries in Wikipedia (5.8M tuples).\n\nOn the positive side, I think that resources for Open IE are useful, and can help spur more research and analyses.\n\nOn the other hand, however, I worry that OPIEC may be too skewed towards the predictions of a specific OIE system, and that the work presented here consists mainly of running off-the-shelf can be extended to contain more novel substance, such as a new Open IE system and its evaluation against this corpus, or more dedicated manual analysis. For example, I believe that most similar resources (e.g., ReVerb tuples) were created as a part of a larger research effort.\n\nThe crux of the matter here I think, is the accuracy of the dataset, reported tersely in Section 5.3, in which a manual analysis (who annotated? what were their guidelines? what was their agreement?) finds that the dataset is estimated to have 60% correct tuples. Can this be improved? Somehow automatically verified?\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- I think that the paper should make it clear in the title or at least in the abstract that the corpus is created automatically by running an OIE system on a large scale. From current title and abstract I was wrongfully expecting a gold human-annotated dataset.\n\n- Following on previous points, I think the paper misses a discussion on gold vs. predicted datasets for OIE, and their different uses. Some missing gold OIE references:\nWu and Weld (2010),  Akbik and Loser (2012), Stanovsky and Dagan (2016).\n\n- Following this line, I don\'t think I agree with the claim in Section 4.3 that ""it is the largest corpus with golden annotations to date"".

However, it still often suffers from the need to engineer a reward function that not only reflects the task but is also carefully shaped. This limits the applicability of RL in the real world. It is therefore of great practical importance to develop algorithms which can learn from unshaped, sparse reward signals, e.g. a binary signal indicating successful task completion. We propose a novel method called competitive experience replay, which efficiently supplements a sparse reward by placing learning in the context of an exploration competition between a pair of agents. Our method complements the recently proposed hindsight experience replay (HER) by inducing an automatic exploratory curriculum. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of reaching various goal locations in an ant maze and manipulating objects with a robotic arm. Each task provides only binary rewards indicating whether or not the goal is completed. Our method asymmetrically augments these sparse rewards for a pair of agents each learning the same task, creating a competitive game designed to drive exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method leads to faster converge and improved task performance.', 'keywords': ['reinforcement learning', 'sparse reward', 'goal-based learning'], 'authorids': ['lhao499@gmail.com', 'atrott@salesforce.com', 'rsocher@salesforce.com', 'cxiong@salesforce.com'], 'authors': ['Hao Liu', 'Alexander Trott', 'Richard Socher', 'Caiming Xiong'], 'TL;DR': 'a novel method to learn with sparse reward using adversarial reward re-labeling', 'pdf': '/pdf/23a4dec1d80c883e3a95d5db05477c0bde852615.pdf', 'paperhash': 'liu|competitive_experience_replay', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\nliu2018competitive,\ntitle={Competitive experience replay},\nauthor={Hao Liu and Alexander Trott and Richard Socher and Caiming Xiong},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sklsm20ctX},\n}'}		Sklsm20ctX	Sklsm20ctX	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	1391	S1l_Fc65KQ	['everyone']		['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']	1538087971209		1549049078731	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

First of all, I agree with R2 that it seems quite surprising and interesting that the original initialization doesn\'t matter after pruning the connectivities. However, I\'ve a subtle disagreement with their intuition that ""neurons in a fully connected layer can be freely swapped"" and that this makes SNIP seem somewhat like random pruning. I don\'t think the neurons are necessarily swappable after removing the initialized weights. This is because the neurons in the first layer may be connected to different unique subsets of pixels, thus making the first layer neurons of the pruned network distinct from each other. Since the first layer neurons are hence unique, the neurons in the second layer, which may similarly be connected to unique subsets of first layer neurons, would also become distinct from each other. Extending this logic across all layers, it thus seems plausible that the connectivities across all layers have much more meaning to them than random pruning. \n\nHowever there are situations where my intuition seems to weaken, and I\'m curious to know what the authors think about these cases. Consider a case where the underlying data is low-dimensional e.g., 2D data, or high-dimensional data where only 2 dimensions matter. How does SNIP with reinitialization fare in this case, when compared to a) random pruning and to b) SNIP without reinitialization? In this case, it seems to me that SNIP pruning would connect all the first layer neurons to exactly the two relevant dimensions, thus making all those neurons fully equivalent to each other after pruning and after erasing the original initialization. Then, my intuition suggests that all subsequent layers are somewhat closer to being randomly pruned, and SNIP *probably* doesn\'t do anything interesting there. \n\nTo test this further, I wonder what happens if we do the following: create a network where the first layer connectivity is borrowed from a SNIP pruned network, and the connectivity in the remaining layers are based on random pruning; the network is then reinitialized. Does this network do worse than SNIP with reinitialization? If it doesn\'t, it will establish that SNIP basically relies on finding the right combinations of pixels that matter for learning, and the connectivity it learns in the subsequent layers doesn\'t really matter. If this network does worse, then it means that SNIP does in fact learn some interesting connectivities across all layers of the network, and it\'s not just about what combinations of pixels are relevant.', 'title': 'SNIP on low-dimensional data?'}"		B1VZqjAcYX	r1gqX1zG44	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper512/Public_Comment	[]	7		['everyone']	B1VZqjAcYX	['~Vaishnavh_Nagarajan3']	1549045537884		1549045624040	['~Vaishnavh_Nagarajan3', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

We appreciate your comments, which will help us to improve the clarity and impact of this paper. However, we decided to withdraw the paper in its current form.  \n\n\nFor this version of the paper we want to address a few of your comments:\n\n\nNovelty and content of the dataset\n\nOne reviewer commented that the data from DBPedia, which is extracted from the semi-structured Infoboxes could be used in a similar way, thus the novelty of the dataset is in question. As our data was extracted from unrestricted text we see those ressources as complementary. While the raw DBPedia data is also noisy it would not contain relations like ""is 16th-century encyclopedia of"" or mentions like ""primarily industrially based economy including metallurgy"". \n\n\nMore details about the dataset\n\nThe details of the dataset are discussed in a companion paper which is currently under submission.\n\n\nMore clarity and insights in the evaluation\n\nWe improved the discussion of the evaluation protocol and the results in the updated version. Despite the diffulty to interpret examples with groups of people whose affiliation is not common knowledge, those are typically ideal examples in such datasets. PERSON and ORG entity types are ubiquitous and can be learned quite well and their academic affiliation can be easily checked by public sources if they are not in the training data. \n\n\nHow does prediction work?\n\nIn the proposed model architectures we can predict over all surface forms whose tokens we observed during training, which would be the powerset of the token vocabulary. In practice, however, we predict over all head and tail surface forms that have been observed during training.\n\n\nIs this just link prediction or just language modelling?\n\nThose two comments from Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2 illustrate perfectly the two endpoints that we attempt to connect. Reviewer #1 commented that this can be seen as link prediction on raw data. As we argue in the paper, we think that it is an important research question to avoid the information loss of canocialization of extracted facts, but nevertheless be able to reason with them in a structured way. Language modelling (LM) is also related to our setting, however, in LM the facts are embedded into a sequential discourse structure and are sourrounded by a lot more information. The assumption of the task is, that models are able to reason about facts only in the constrained relational structure.

In contrast to traditional knowledge graphs, OKGs do not use a predefined or closed vocabulary of entities and relations. The same entity can be mentioned in many different ways, and relations can be semantically close but not equal (e.g. ``visited by'' and ``frequently visited by''). The open link prediction problem is as follows: Given a mention of an entity and an open relation (e.g., ``A. Einstein'' and ``is a native of''), predict correct entity mentions (e.g., ``Imperial Germany'') using solely the OKG. Models that solve the open link prediction task successfully need to be able to reason about different entity mentions, as well as the relations between them, in a fully automatic, unsupervised way. We propose a benchmark consisting of an OKG dataset and an evaluation protocol for this task, and discuss and evaluate various baseline models.

The results for the image retrieval tasks are mixed not because the VGG16 network is a bad feature extractor but because the entities and corresponding images are heterogeneous. For instance, there are entities such as “Albert Einstein” for which the feature extraction works very well, and other such as “USA” for which it is challenging because there is no canonical image representing said entity. We envision in the future models that pay attention to particular more canonical images in this case. We do not anticipate significant improvement by simply using a different feature extractor. Replacing the VGG16 network with a deeper or more advanced CNN, for example, should lead to minor improvements only. \nMoreover, we would like to clarify that the model is pre-trained on ImageNet, but the entire model is end-to-end fine tuned, with each of the scoring functions.\n\nThe results for relation prediction and zero-shot learning are actually promising. Since the input for the system is an image, there is no information about the entity that it represents.

Don\'t you get another feature map for each filter? Isn\'t the use of multiple filters rather to capture different semantics within the sentence?\nAns: It is true that the use of multiple features facilitates capturing different semantics within the sentence. We have corrected this section on max-pooling in the paper.\n\nQ2.  ""The task of predicting n-ary relations is modeled both as a binary and multi-class classification problem"": How do you do that? Are there different softmax layers? And if yes, how do you decide which one to use?\nAns: The task of predicting n-ary relations as a binary and multi-classification problem is specific to the datasets that are used in the paper. While using the Peng et al. (2016) dataset, we have a multi-class classification problem. However, when we are working with Chemcial-induced dataset, we have a binary classification problem, to predict whether their exists a binary relation between the entities both in single sentence and across sentences. Therefore, when working with Peng et al dataset, we use softmax function with categorical cross entropy loss to output probability over the five output classes (resistance; resistance or no-response; response; sensitivity; and none) and employ softmax layer with binary cross-entropy loss to predict probability over two classes.\n\nQ3:  Table 1/2: How can you draw conclusions about the performance on binary and ternary relations from these tables? I can only see the distinction of single sentence and cross sentence there.\nAns: As indicated in the caption for Tables 1 and 2, while Table 1 specifically deals with ternary relations involving ternary relations between drug-gene-mutation, Table 2 deals with binary relations involving drug-gene entities. However, these binary and ternary relations exists both in single sentences and across sentences. Thus the distinction between single and across sentences is made. Given this aspect, the conclusions are drawn for the performance of binary and ternary relations in single sentences and across sentences.\n\nQ4: - Table 3: The numbers for short distance spans (mostly 20.0) look suspicious to me. What is the frequency of short/medium/long distance spans in the datasets? Are they big enough to be able to draw any conclusions from them?\nAns: The reviewer is right in noting that there are very few instances for short distance spans. This is also the reason why the performance of different models are lower for short distance spans, compared to medium and long distance spans.\n\nQ5: - You say that CNN_LSTM does not work because after applying the CNN all sequential information is lost. But how can you apply an LSTM afterwards then? Is there any recurrence at all? (The sequential information would not be lost after the CNN if you didn\'t apply pooling. Have you tried that?)\nAns: We had conducted experiments removing the max-pooling layer and passing the features to an LSTM layer. However, this did not help in improving the performance.\n\nQ6: Your observation that more than two positional embeddings decrease the performance is interesting (and unexpected). Do you have any insights on this? Does the model pay attention at all to the second of three entities? What would happen if you simply deleted this entity or even some context around this entity (i.e., perform an adversarial attack on your model)?\nAns: Given the experimental results, we observe that adding positional embeddings for more than two entities results in a decrease in the performance. We have not conducted further experiments such as removing the second entity or context around the second entity. Removing the second entity or the context around it would certainly result in a poor performance as we would be disturbing the sequential information. However, it is worthwhile to conduct such experiments and intend to do it in the future.\n\nQ7: Typos\nAns: Thanks for identifying the typos.

In the section of Parameter Learning, we explain how maximizing expected log likelihood is equivalent to minimizing cross entropy (Equation 3). As our proposed approach optimizes on cross entropy, it induces an average reduction in the cross entropy of 82% and 85% as compared to ProbFOIL+ and AMIE+ respectively. The insignificant differences in precision-recall curves only suggest that obtaining a ranking of tuples based on predicted probabilities (but not the actual probabilities) can be quite reliably done already by models that are not very precise when it comes to predicting the actual probabilities.\n\n\n2) The approach is straightforward and depends heavily on the candidate rules produced by AMIE+.\n\nOur approach is straightforward on purpose as we want to see how much the proper treatment of probabilities in the KB completion task using a rule-based approach helps. At first glance, SafeLearner does seem to be heavily dependent on the rules generated by AMIE+. But AMIE+ is not a black-box as we exactly know the kind of rules we require as candidates. Had AMIE+ not been developed, we could have coded the function ourselves to generate candidate rules. Since AMIE+ is a multi-threaded package in Java, it does the job well by scaling well to large KBs. Furthermore, as SafeLearner is not specific to any particular candidate generation method, it can be used with any other relational rule learner instead of AMIE+.\n\n\n3) The paper does not provide insights into the drawbacks of using AMIE+, the kind of rules that will be hard for AMIE+ to produce.\n\nAs mentioned in the cited paper ‘Fast rule mining in ontological knowledge bases with AMIE+’ (Galarraga et al.,2015), AMIE+ uses 3 types of language biases to restrict the size of the search space:\n\t1) The rules learned by AMIE+ omit reflexive atoms of the form ‘x(A, A)’.\n\t2) The rules are connected, i.e., every atom shares at least one variable transitively to every other atom of the rule. This omits vague rules of the form ‘x(A, B) :- y(C, D)’.\n\t3) The rules are closed, i.e., all the variables in a rule appear at least twice within itself. This omits open rules of the form ‘x(A, B) :- b(A, C)’ which would hold for any substitution of B and C.\n\nMoreover, AMIE+ only works with binary relations in a KB and does not have negations in its rules. For instance, the types of non-recursive rules of length <= 3, that can be generated by AMIE+ within SafeLearner are:\n\t  1) x(A, B) :- y(A, B).\n    \t  2) x(A, B) :- y(B, A).\n\n    \t  3) x(A, B) :- y(A, C), y(C, B).\n    \t  4) x(A, B) :- y(A, C), y(B, C).\n    \t  5) x(A, B) :- y(C, A), y(C, B).\n    \t  6) x(A, B) :- y(C, A), y(B, C).\n\n    \t  7) x(A, B) :- y(A, C), z(C, B).\n    \t  8) x(A, B) :- y(A, C), z(B, C).\n    \t  9) x(A, B) :- y(C, A), z(C, B).\n     \t10) x(A, B) :- y(C, A), z(B, C).\nIn the context of doing Probabilistic Rule Learning for KB Completion, these are precisely all the forms of rules which we require as we can not practically predict missing tuples using reflexive, disconnected or open rules. SafeLearner is capable of learning rules of any length by specifying the maximum rule length as an input parameter. \n\n\n4) How can the proposed method be improved to learn rules beyond the candidate rules?\n\nThe method can be used with any other method that learns deterministic rules to make them probabilistic. We do not claim that using AIME+ is the best. Our main interest is in seeing if/how the proper treatment of probabilities helps in the KB completion tasks using a rule-based approach.'}		HkyI-5667	rJgHsQcWNN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper54/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper54/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	5		['everyone']	HyxYWizrfV	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper54/Authors']	1549013917038		1549013917038	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper54/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The SRL based approach is much more interpretable and explainable as compared to the black-box KGE based approaches but also, in our opinion, as compared to Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs). KGE based approaches, including NTPs, also need the test data to get the embedding which is not required by any SRL based approaches. SRL based approaches can reason with unseen constants in the data as they learn first-order rules. KGE based approaches would require re-training in order to incorporate a lot of new constants which is not the case with our SRL based approach. Please refer to Appendix E for further details.\n\nTo compare the scalability of SafeLearner with NTPs, ‘End-to-end differentiable proving’ uses 4 deterministic KBs that are not at a large scale (Countries KB has 1158 facts, Kinship KB has 10686 facts, Nations KB has 2565 facts and UMLS KB has 6529 facts). Recently, they submitted a follow-up paper, ’Towards Neural Theorem Proving at Scale’, where they claim to have made their technique more scalable. The follow-up paper uses the following 3 deterministic KBs: 1) WordNet18 KB with 151,442 facts, 2) WordNet18RR with 93,003 facts, and 3) Freebase FB15k-237 KB with 14,951 facts. On the other hand, SafeLearner has demonstrated that it scales to YAGO 2.4 KB of 948,000 probabilistic tuples. Although previous SRL techniques were not as scalable, SafeLearner is as scalable as the latest version of NTPs because it is the first SRL technique to use lifted inference.\n\nMoreover, in our opinion, NTPs do not actually 'learn' rules. They enumerate all possible rules up to a defined length and learn how to activate them.  Essentially, NTPs optimize theorem-proving procedure given the rules. In their follow-up paper, they focus on finding just one proof efficiently (instead of all proofs, as in the initial version) and this brings them scalability.""}"		HkyI-5667	BkgjQm5Z44	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper54/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper54/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	4		['everyone']	HyxYWizrfV	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper54/Authors']	1549013795105		1549013795105	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper54/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

How does sparsity affect the algorithm design?\n\nSince SafeLearner is a Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approach that would learn first-order rules to predict tuples, it can even reason about new constants being included in the KB without re-training. On the other hand, since knowledge graph embedding (KGE) based approaches implicitly consider all tuples, these may discard the existence of a tuple with a new constant as the embedding for the new constant does not exist. Thus, it is easier for SRL based approaches to handle highly sparse KBs as they can handle the high number of constants since they only learn first-order rules. \n\n\n2) I am not convinced by the potential application of the methods. After generating the probabilistic rules, how can I apply them? It will be appreciated if the authors can present some examples of the use of the probabilistic rules. If it is mainly to complete probabilistic KBs, how does this probabilistic logics based approach compare against embedding based approach?\n\nWe have answered this question in Appendix E.

We hope it is clearer now.\n\n\n2) In the algorithm, line 22, aren\'t rules removed until H leads to a ""safe"" UCQ?\n\nWe have elaborated further on our algorithm in the paper. Checking for a safe UCQ is performed in Line 8 of QueryConstructor function. The only way to check for a safe query is by trying to construct a query plan, which is exactly what happens inside SlimShot. So if SlimShot fails to construct a query plan, the UCQ is considered to be unsafe.\n\n\n3) Section 6.1: ""In line 7 we formulate a UCQ Q from all the candidate rules in H (explained in 5.2 with an example)"". I was unable to find the example in section 5.2.\n\nThank you for pointing it out. It has now been rectified in the revision.\n\n\n4) It would be interesting to have an idea of the maximum scale that ProbFoil+ can handle since it seems to be the only competitor to the suggested method.\n\nWe have conducted a small experiment to demonstrate that ProbFOIL+ struggles to scale upto large KBs with a number of target tuples > 5000. On the other hand, such large KBs are handled reasonably faster by SafeLearner.  For instance, for a simple probabilistic KB with 20000 target tuples and 20000 non-target tuples, ProbFOIL+ took 15 hours and 54 minutes and SafeLearner took just 30 minutes. The detailed procedure and results of the experiment could be found in Appendix C.\n\n\n5) In section 7.2 does the ""learning time"" include the call to AMIE+?\n\nYes, the learning time includes both structure learning (including AMIE+) and parameter learning components.\n\n\n6) I found that it was sometimes hard to understand what was a part of the proposed system, and what was done in AMIE+ or Slimshot.\n\nOnly line 3 in Algorithm 1 uses AMIE+. On the other hand, SlimShot is used in lines 7 (QueryConstructor function) and 10 (ProbabilityPredictor function). Every other line of Algorithm 1 is part of SafeLearner.\n\n\n7) Explain the breaking down of queries into independent sub-queries in the algorithm.\n\nIf a query can be written as a union of independent sub-queries then its probability can be expressed as a unification of the probability of its sub-queries. We have explained this further in Appendix D.\n\n\n8) Caching is not mentioned anywhere in the algorithm.\n\nWe use caching/memoization before calling SlimShot in SafeLearner.  This is primarily done to speed up SafeLearner by storing the results of the expensive function call to SlimShot and returning the cached result when the structure of the query occurs again in the input. Since SlimShot produces a query plan, we exploit the fact that isomorphic queries naturally have the same query plans. We have explained this further in Appendix D.\n\n\n9) Some of the components which are sold as important for the speed-up in the conclusion aren\'t clear enough in the main text. Some numbers to experimentally back-up how important these additions are to the algorithms would be welcome.\n\nWe performed an experiment where we compared SafeLearner with and without the 2 speed-up techniques, memoization, and query disintegration. Our results on NELL (850th iteration) and YAGO show that memoization and query disintegration give an average speed-up of 50% and 7% respectively. It is important to understand that query disintegration would only give a speed-up when SafeLearner learns a high number of rules with a lot of rules being independent to one another.

These KBs are typically used to perform query inferences and rule mining. But their efficacy is only as high as their completeness. Efficiently utilizing incomplete KBs remains a major challenge as the current KB completion techniques either do not take into account the inherent uncertainty associated with each KB tuple or do not scale to large KBs.\n\nProbabilistic rule learning not only considers the probability of every KB tuple but also tackles the problem of KB completion in an explainable way. For any given probabilistic KB, it learns probabilistic first-order rules from its relations to identify interesting patterns. But, the current probabilistic rule learning techniques perform grounding to do probabilistic inference for evaluation of candidate rules. It does not scale well to large KBs as the time complexity of inference using grounding is exponential over the size of the KB. In this paper, we present SafeLearner -- a scalable solution to probabilistic KB completion that performs probabilistic rule learning using lifted probabilistic inference -- as faster approach instead of grounding. \n\nWe compared SafeLearner to the state-of-the-art probabilistic rule learner ProbFOIL+ and to its deterministic contemporary AMIE+ on standard probabilistic KBs of NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner) and Yago.

Each triple could also contain zero or more supporting provenance sentences/pieces of text. If provenance is provided we consider the provenance provided by the IE system and do not attempt to find additional provenance (only stage 2 is executed).\n\nIf provenance is missing, then provenance is retrieved from the text corpus, i.e., both stages are executed. \n\nWe convert either the retrieved sentences (or the provided provenance) and the input triple into a feature vector for the classifier. We encode the sentences by taking the average of the word embeddings, and then concatenate that average embedding with binary features (see Section 4.1 last paragraph) and the result of the outer product of one-hot relation vector and the EncodedSentence vector.\n\nThe input ""EncodedSentence"" in Figure 4 represents the feature vector provided to the classifier for all retrieved sentences.

We address them below:\n\n(1) In general, based on anecdotal evidence it seems that the relative predictive performance of GRU and LSTM cells depends on the particular task at hand. In our case, we selected GRU cells based on experiments we performed with both LSTM and GRU cells during the model design, which showed that GRU cells led to better results. Another potential benefit of this choice is increased training performance, as GRU cells are less complex and less computation-intensive than LSTM cells. We revised Section 4.3 to explain the reasoning behind our choice of GRU cells. \n\n(2) We are referring to the complexity of modeling and performing inference from the joint probability of the entire set of tags, which is an NP-hard problem. To avoid the exponential blowup, existing techniques employ different types of approximation algorithms (e.g., Ganea and Hoffman (2017) present an N^2 approximation algorithm using a fully-connected pairwise conditional random field, which requires loopy belief propagation to train). Our proposal is to model the problem as a tag sequence using a recurrent net to avoid combinatorial explosion, though other solutions could also be proposed to reduce the complexity (i.e. model it as a tag sequence and use a conditional random field or a hidden Markov model). We cleaned up the language surrounding this point both in the abstract and in Section 4.3. \n\n(3) We intend to make the code of the best models for each dataset available upon acceptance and will be providing a link to it in the paper. \n\n(4) We attempted to obtain significance results during the author feedback period by performing 10-fold cross-validation on the NCBI disease corpus both for the best NormCo model and the best baseline model (which is TaggerOne). While we were able to obtain the evaluation metrics for NormCo, we ran into several issues while retraining TaggerOne on new splits, including (a) TaggerOne’s code breaking (i.e., throwing null pointer exceptions) and (b) TaggerOne’s internal F-score evaluation failing for concepts that have multiple labels (such as “inherited neuromuscular disease”, which is mapped to both MESH:D009468 “Neuromuscular disease” and MESH:D030342 “Genetic diseases, inborn”), which were not present in the original test set. Ultimately these issues, coupled with TaggerOne’s long training times documented in Section 6.4.5, did not allow us to obtain significance results for TaggerOne. However, we were able to perform cross-validation of the best NormCo model (i.e., MC-synthetic), which resulted in an average accuracy of 0.853 with a low standard deviation of 0.013.

We address some of the issues raised below:\n\n(1) The reason that results on BC5 are mixed is that our model is more conservative, favoring high precision over recall (see Table 3). Since the BC5CDR dataset has a greater diversity of concepts that the NCBI dataset (1082 concepts in BC5CDR compared to 753 in NCBI), the lower recall becomes more important, leading to a slightly lower accuracy than the baseline models. However, note that even in this case the NormCo model still outperforms the baselines on the average LCA distance performance metric, which, as explained in the paper, takes into account not only the overall accuracy but also the severity of the errors.

Please find the clarification of each of the concerns below.\n\n* Clarification 1 (strong baselines mentioned under Pros):\n\nTo best of our knowledge we are first to propose a standalone framework to jointly determine credibility and propose repair. As noted in ""Related Work"" other systems determine credibility but cannot be applied to our problem since (i) they depend on search engine results which are opaque to internal processing), and (ii) they use ensemble of output from multiple IE systems on same text corpus. The closest to our approach which are also standalone were DistMult and ComplEx which are inferring on graph structure (treating an IE system as a black box) as described in Section 5.2.\n\n* Clarification 2 (Retrieving sentences and passing it to IE system mentioned under Pros):\n\nWe treat the internal workings of an IE system as a black-box. Our system can be used as a post diagnosis approach to tackle errors from an IE system. This is different from running an IE system on retrieved sentences. \n\n* Clarification 2a (independent performance same as joint performance):\n\nAs noted by Kaiser et.al 2017 when the dataset is large the performance difference between training a model independently or jointly is small. Our results support this observation: our WikiData dataset is large, which we believe to be the reason for the close performance between our independently trained and jointly trained models.\n\nReference: Lukasz Kaiser, Aidan N. Gomez, Noam Shazeer, Ashish Vaswani, Niki Parmar, Llion Jones, Jakob Uszkoreit. “One Model To Learn Them All”. arxiv.org/abs/1706.05137 (2017)\n\nWe have added the clarification in last paragraph of Section 5.3.\n\n* Clarification 3 (approach to combine (or represent) retrieved sentences):\n\nWe combined all the retrieved sentenced and agree that averaging word embeddings is a straightforward approach for getting a sentence embedding; nevertheless, we found it yielded reasonable results and focused on the core tasks of our effort---joint credibility and fact repair adjudication. As stated in Section 5.4 last paragraph we also tried using a CNN and an LSTM for sentence representation and found it to perform poorly with same training time and higher computation cost.\n\n* Clarification 4 (negative sampling):\n\nWe tried using other negative sampling strategies, where we changed all combinations of predicate, object and provenance but found each of the techniques to perform on par with, or marginally lower than, our final sampling strategy. We found that the negative sampling described in Section 4.3 to perform best (with F1 score between 87 to 89) on a balanced dataset containing 50% positive and 50% negative test instances.  We use both F1-Macro and F1-Micro, which internally uses Precision, and Recall, to avoid considering performance gain only on negative classes. Hence Negative Sampling helps in learning without inflating score of negative examples. Moreover, we also consider using MRR to understand ranking of the repair relations.\n\n* Clarification 5a (combining binary features):\n\nBinary features are extracted from each of the retrieved sentences and combined using bitwise OR-ing. We found that concatenating all retrieved sentences with average of word embedding gave reasonable results. \n\n* Clarification 5b (explicit input of extracted relation):\n\nWe study the effect of making the neural network model aware of the extracted relation in the ablation study of ""OuterProduct,"" where we compute the outer product of the relation one-hot vector with concatenated average of the sentence word embedding and binary features. The effect of making the model implicitly aware of the extracted relation can be seen by comparing the “outer product” rows with the rest in Tables 3 and 4. Performance gain is high across multiple datasets when “OuterProduct” is used compared to the network which is not aware of the extracted relation like in KG-Cleaner Basic.\n\n'}"		ryleB-56pQ	SJgldh7WNE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper49/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper49/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	ryxmHcy4GV	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper49/Authors']	1548987495743		1548987526333	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper49/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The\nfirst training phase (the “pre-training”) is used to find good initializations\nfor the embedding vectors of the second phase (the variational EM). For this\npre-training, we ran experiments both with uniform initial $\\lambda$ and with\ninitial $\\lambda$ proportional to the frequency.

The final prediction does indeed not take uncertainty\ninto account, as we discuss in the conclusions. The proposed hyperparameter\noptimization algorithm, however, only works because of a Bayesian treatment of\nthe latent embedding vectors. As we mention in the last paragraph on page 6, a\ngradient based hyperparameter optimization that ignores posterior uncertainty\nwould lead to divergent solutions.

This minimizes the loss if the model parameters\n(=embedding vectors) are strictly zero, which is possible in a point estimated\nmodel.\n\nTaking posterior uncertainty into account solves the issue of divergent\nsolutions. Since we attribute a nonzero uncertainty to every embedding vector,\nembedding vectors can no longer be deterministically zero, and the divergent\nsolutions are no longer possible.

We will mention them in the\nRelated Works section of our paper, and we will highlight the novelty of our\npaper as follows:\n\nFirst, rather than proposing a model following traditions in the probabilistic\nmodels literature, we propose a Bayesian version of the best performing\nknowledge graph embedding model that we could find in the literature [Lacroix et\nal. (2018)]. This is how we were able to beat the state of the art on standard\nbenchmark tasks: we build on the experience that went into the design of the\nembedding model, and we add to it the ability to do fast model selection using\nvariational EM.\n\nSecond, we focus specifically on the task of hyperparameter optimization. As\npointed out in [Kadlec et al. (2017)], the predictive performance of knowledge\ngraph embedding models is very sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters\n(mainly the strength of the regularizer). Unfortunately, hyperparameter tuning\nwith traditional grid search becomes very expensive due to the large number of\nhyperparameters. We point out that the observed sensitivity to the strength of\nthe regularizer can be explained by the fact that knowledge graphs operate in\nthe low-data regime (see Figure 1). We therefore propose to use a Bayesian\nmethod for hyperparameter tuning.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first publication that proposes\nBayesian methods for hyperparameter tuning in knowledge graph embedding models,\nand that reaches state of the art on standard benchmarks while dramatically\nreducing the computational cost for hyperparameter tuning.\n\n\n> The paper and the approach is in many respects counter-intuitive: E.g., an\n> embedding for each entity is drawn from its own prior [...]\n\nWe think that there may be a misunderstanding that we will resolve with a more\nexplicit notation for the model and hyperparameters. We will make it more\nexplicit that the prior has only a single scalar tunable parameter per entity\nand relation, while the approximate posterior has 8,000 free parameters per\nentity and relation. This is because the prior is not only centered around zero\nas the reviewer correctly points out. Importantly, the prior is also isotropic\nin the $K=2,000$ dimensional embedding space. By contrast, the approximate\nposterior has four tunable parameters *for each dimension* (real and imaginary\npart of both mean and standard deviation).\n\n\n> Using EM with single-sample-per-paramterized-prior is an unorthodox choice [...] \n\nWe would like to clarify that we fit a prior for each embedding vector and not\nfor each data point. The embedding vector for a given entity is shared across\nall data points that contain this entity. Therefore, our method fits each prior\ndistribution to several data points.\n\n> [...] which would generally result in degenerate solutions (the prior will\n> simply match the posterior).\n\nWe agree that EM would fit priors that simply match the posterior if one chose a\nvery flexible family of prior distributions. This is a general property of EM\nand not specific to our model. In practice, one avoids this degenerate limit of\nEM either by imposing an additional “hyper-prior”, or by making the family of\nprior distributions much more restrictive than the variational family of\napproximate posterior distributions. We opted for the latter solution for\nsimplicity.

Although preliminary, we believe there is sufficient value in this work to share these current findings, and have added a sentence to the text to clarify this point.\n\n> Reviewer 2: Based on Figure 1C, the system maxes out at around 73%, even with an ensemble of workers. It is not \n> clear to me how satisfactory this level of accuracy is. For example, would this be good enough to train a relation\n> extraction model? \n\n--We believe that our current 73% maximum accuracy could be improved with further refinement of our platform based on the findings reported in this paper.  In general, our intuition is that Citizen Science alone would be sufficiently accurate for assistive or statistical analyses, but not of comparable accuracy to expert curation. We are exploring more quantitative methods of assessing the accuracy needed for various biomedical applications.  In addition, we have added a short explanation on the differences in our relationship extraction effort from other efforts which make drawing direct comparison difficult.\n\n> Reviewer 2: Some design choices seem odd and perhaps merit some explanation. For example, why not use\n> Mark2Cure on relations between entities of the same type? It was noted that SemMedDB has such relations, and in\n> general there seem to be many valid cases of these (drug-drug interactions, gene regulation, etc.). \n\n--In our limited experience and from what we’ve observed of SemMedDB, the vast majority of relationships between entities of the same type tend to be hypernymic propositions (“is a”). SemMedDB is actually very good with hypernymic propositions (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046403001175?via%3Dihub), so we limited the annotations to be done by citizen scientists to those of different entity types. Clarification has been added to the methods section.\n\n> Reviewer 2: I don\'t understand the grey dots in Figure 4. What does it mean that no identifier was available? \n\n--Not every annotation from Pubtator is linked to an identifier. Annotations lacking identifiers may or may not be synonymous with other annotations lacking identifiers within an abstract so it becomes difficult to calculate the minimum distance within the text between two concepts if there are multiple annotations lacking identifiers. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight and have made the necessary clarifications in the text.\n\n> Reviewer 2: Some minor formatting things: M2C was used as an acronym but not defined.

The key components of the KB are (1) food nutrition data, (2) recipes and ingredients, and (3) links to DBpedia concepts. The data was imported from various structured data sources. The paper also explains how to embed ingredients based on their co-occurrences.\n\n== Pros ==\n- The main motivation for building a KB for food is for dietary recommendation, which is a laudable goal.\n- The KB schema is sound and the description of the system is pretty clear.\n\n== Cons ==\n- The novelty of the work is unclear.\n\nIf my understanding is correct, the data sources are all structured data with known schema, and the task boils down to (1) importing the data and (2) linking entities between data sources. Part (1) is an engineering task that all KB developers already have to do, so the main part that could contain novelty would be entity linking.\n\nHowever, the methods described in the paper are either a heuristic (e.g., string manipulation ""Cheese, Blue"" --> dbr:blue_cheese), an external API (e.g., DBpedia search), or a well-known simple technique (e.g., cosine similarity between bag-of-word vectors). The paper describes several challenges in Section 3.3 (e.g., ambiguous names, synonyms, spelling errors), but the proposed methods do not seem to address these challenges. The proposed ingredient embedding method in Section 5.2 also greatly resembles food2vec mentioned in the related work section. \n\nAs such, it seems that the only novel contribution of this paper is the KB itself, which leads to the second point:\n\n- It is unclear if the KB is accurate enough for actual use.\n\nApart from Section 5.1 on entity resolution, there is no formal evaluation of the methods. As the described methods do not address the challenges in Section 3.3, it is less likely that the identified links are accurate enough for actual use in health-sensitive use cases.\n\nThe evaluation in Section 5.1 also raises a question regarding how the disagreements (~50% of the cases) between the proposed entity linking method and DBpedia search are reconciled.', 'rating': '6: Marginally above acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		B1gjSZ9TpQ	SJg_eiGjWE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper53/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper53/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	B1gjSZ9TpQ	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper53/AnonReviewer1']	1546492655566		1548982764680	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Their paper illustrates the difficulty of the task, noting that “99.8% of [AQA-QR rewrites] start with the prefix What is [name]...”.  They speculate that this “might be related to the fact that virtually all answers involve names, of named entities (Micronesia) or generic concepts (pizza).” We hope to expand our work to include question and topic expansion in the near future, as we agree that making progress on open-vocabulary query reformulation in the context of non-factoid question answering is an exciting effort.\n\nWe have space in the paper and have included examples of the rewritten queries in our revision.  This also goes along with your Clarity Con point 2 -- the rewritten query is a concatenation of the selected terms.\n\nWe will try to work in an example of the decision rule in the appendix.  Since the decision rule uses many query results it takes up significant space.  Informally, the decision rule looks at the average or max entailment for each answer for the various query results.  This is tuned on the ARC-Challenge-Train dataset.\n\nIndeed, as you say the rewriter is trained only on the Essential Terms dataset and the entailment is only trained on the SciTail dataset.  We are in the process of transforming some of the ARC-Challenge questions to fine tune the entailment model but this work is not completed yet.  The Decision Rules are trained on 1/5th of the ARC-Training set which we can use as we have not used the ARC-Train for any other portion of the model.  \n\nWe agree that leveraging background knowledge is an important line of research, and that the work is this paper represents very early steps towards fully utilizing it in an open-domain QA pipeline.

87	1548953738863	"{'title': 'Concerns clarification', 'comment': ""-->Q1: One major question I have is for the taxonomy evaluation part, I think there are works trying to do taxonomy evaluation by using node-level and edge-level evaluation. 'A Short Survey on Taxonomy Learning from Text Corpora:\nIssues, Resources, and Recent Advances' from NAACL 2017 did a nice summarization for this. Is there any reason why this evaluation is not applicable here?\n\nAns: The above-mentioned paper is mainly about the recent work on taxonomy construction from free texts, which is different from what we are proposing in this paper. Our goal is not to create taxonomies but to learn word embeddings that preserve taxonomic information as vector representations. As we do not create taxonomies, we cannot evaluate the word embeddings using taxonomy evaluation methods.\n\n-->Q2: At the end of section 4.2, the author mentioned Retrofit, JointReps and HyperVec are using the original author prepared wordnet data. Then the supervised training data is different for different methods? Is there a more controlled experiment where all experiments are using the same training data?\n\nAns: The models Retrofit, JointReps, and HyperVec (and the newly added two recent relevant work (Poincare and LEAR)) work with pairwise relation data. However, the proposed HWE works on a full hierarchical hypernym path. Therefore, the models require slightly different data.\n\n-->Q3: In section 4.4, there are three prediction methods are introduced including ADD, SUM, and DH. The score is calculated using cosine similarity. But the loss function used in the model is by minimizing the L2 distance between word embeddings? Is there any reason why not use L2 but cosine similarity in this setting?\n\nAns: We have empirically tested both the L2 and cosine and found that the cosine to work better in the given experiment.\n\n-->Q4: Also, I'm assuming SUM and DH are using cosine similarity as well? It might be useful to add that bit of information. \n\nAns: Yes. This has been added in the updated version of the paper.\n\n-->Q5: The motivation for this paper is to using taxonomy instead of just hypernym pairs?\n\nAns: Yes\n\n-->Q6: Another line of research trying to encode the taxonomy structure into the geometry space such that the taxonomy will be automatically captured due to the self-organized geometry space. Some papers including but not restricted 'Order-Embeddings of Images and Language', 'Probabilistic Embedding of Knowledge Graphs with Box Lattice Measures'. Probably this line of work is not directly comparable, but it might be useful to add to the related work session.\n\nAns: Thank you for the suggestion. We have now updated the paper with two more related works, Poincare[1] and LEAR[2] and empirically compare the proposed method against them.\nPlease note that Probabilistic and Box Embeddings are relatively less related to the proposed method as they working on phrase embeddings and used pre-trained word embeddings to feed an LSTM for learning phrase embeddings.\n\n[1] Poincare Embeddings [Nikel and Kiela] - NIPS 2017\n[2] Specialising Word Vectors for Lexical Entailment [Vulic and Mrksic] - NAACL-HLT 2018\n\n-->Q7: In equation four of section 3, t_max appears for the first time. This equation maybe part of the GLOVE objective, but a one-sentence explanation of t_max might be needed here.\n\nAns: Yes, it is the weighting function of GloVe so that it becomes relatively small for words of large frequency and set to 100  as stated in section (4.1).\n\n-->Q8: at the end of section 3, the calculation of gradients for different parameters are given, but the optimization is actually performed by AdaGrad. Maybe it would be good to move these equations to the appendix.\n\nAns: The gradients equations have been moved to the appendix in the updated version of the paper.\n\n-->Q9: In section 4.1 experiment set up, the wordnet training data is generated by performing transitive closure I assume? How does the wordnet synsets get mapped to its surface form in order to do further training and evaluation?\n\nAns: We lemmatise the corpus and use the form given in the WordNet as the surface form.""}"		S1xf-W5paX	Sklm9dog44	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper26/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper26/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	ryg8XPy4fE	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper26/Authors']	1548953738863		1548953738863	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper26/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Poincare seems to be an excellent fit to be empirically compared against the proposed method, as they both share a similar spirit to explicitly learn hierarchical word embeddings rather than hypernymy-specific embeddings\nWe have now updated the paper with two more related works, Poincare[1] and LEAR[2] and empirically compare the proposed method against them.\nWe have also updated the paper with a new evaluation task (section 4.4) to test the proposed method on a graded lexical entailment as suggested by reviewer3.\nThe proposed method reports an improvement over most of the prior works, including Poincare, in the three tasks (hypernym detection, graded lexical entailment, and the hierarchical path completion), except for the LEAR in two datasets.\nMore interestingly, Poincare seems to perform well in the proposed hierarchical path completion task in contrast to the other methods apart from HWE. The fact that Poincare embeddings, a hierarchical word embeddings learn method, reports good performance on this hierarchical path completion task, suggests that this is an appropriate task for evaluating hierarchies and embeddings. \n\nPlease note that Probabilistic and Box Embeddings are relatively less related to the proposed method as they work on phrase embeddings and use pre-trained word embeddings to feed an LSTM for learning phrase embeddings.\n\n[1] Poincare Embeddings [Nikel and Kiela] - NIPS 2017\n[2] Specialising Word Vectors for Lexical Entailment [Vulic and Mrksic] - NAACL-HLT 2018\n\n\n-->Q2: I found the order of presentation awkward, and sometimes hard to follow. For example, I would have liked to see a clear explanation of test-time inference before the learning objective was presented, and I’m still left wondering why there is not a closer correspondence between the multiple inference methods described (in Table 3) and the learning objective.\n\nAns: We use the hierarchical word embeddings produced by the proposed method (HWE) in three tasks: hypernym detection (section 4.3), graded lexical entailment (section 4.4) and the hierarchical path completion (section 4.5).\nEach task has different inference methods, and that is the reason why we describe the inference methods under each section separately and not in the method for learning hierarchical word embeddings section.\nFor example, for the first task (section 4.3) we used the concatenation approach as stated in the section.\nSimilarly, for the graded lexical entailment task, we used the inference method described in section 4.4 (Eq. (6)).\nThe inference methods described in Table 3 are specific to the hierarchical path completion task.\nAmong the different inference methods compared in Table 3, ADD corresponds closely to the training objective used by the HWE learning method we propose (see Eq. (2)). This might explain why ADD turns out to be the best inference methods in Table 3.\n\n\n-->Q3: I would also have liked to see a clear motivation for why the GloVE embedding is compatible with and beneficial for the hypernym task. “Relatedness” is different than “hypernymy.”\n\nAns: All the datasets in the hypernym identification task are pairwise relation data, and it could be the case that it easier for such distributional methods to pick the hypernymy, where hypernymy tend to occur in similar context.'}		S1xf-W5paX	ByeAXLjlEV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper26/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper26/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	ByxfoMkHM4	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper26/Authors']	1548953125709		1548953125709	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper26/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Our response is as follows:  (1/2)', 'comment': '\nComment 1:\nIncomplete evaluation and mention detection not improving on FIGER as the results reported for the baseline used in our work is different for the results reported in the original FIGER paper (Table 2 of http://xiaoling.github.io/pubs/ling-aaai12.pdf)\n\nResponse to comment 1:\nThis is indeed a very interesting observation. We would like to clarify here that the results reported in the FIGER paper and in the baseline of the proposed work are not comparable due to the following reasons:\n1. The datasets used are different as the FIGER paper does not use the FIGER dataset for a part of their experiments. This might seems surprising and can be easily missed as it is mentioned in the footnote 4 of the FIGER paper, decoupled with the result table.\n2. The learning models are different.\n\nWe followed a simple and consistent evaluation strategy for Table 5, which we summarize below:\n1. Entity Recognition can be decomposed into two sub-problems: Entity Detection and Entity Classification\n2. Use current state-of-the-art learning model for both the sub-problems in a pipelined manner and report the result for the entity recognition task. \n3. The dataset used for the sub-problems is the same, as mentioned in Table 5. There is other interpretation of results as that of the results reported in the FIGER paper.\n\nWe apologize for not bringing the correct interpretation of the results in the FIGER paper beforehand, which could have avoided this confusion.\n\nWe would like to add here that mention detection is improving on both the datasets: FIGER and 1k-WFB-g. Please refer to Table 4. The resulting analysis of entity detection is available in Section 5.2.4. Also, there is an analysis of entity detection in Section 3. The improvement for mention detection is 0.08% F1 on FIGER dataset and 15.21% F1 on 1k-WFB-g. Note that although the improvement is small on FIGER, this improvement is over a model trained on a manually annotated (complete noise-free) dataset which matches well with FIGER dataset as both have predominant mentions of person, location and organization entity types. When we compare with a distantly supervised dataset, we have an improvement of 37.11% on FIGER dataset.\n\nWe hope that this clarification will resolve the concerns about incomplete evaluation. We have updated Section 3 (last paragraph) and Section 5.2.2 (last paragraph) to clearly state that the results in FIGER paper are not directly comparable. \n\nWe will be glad to answer any other questions related to the evaluation. \n\n\nComment 2:\nResemblance to http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2015\n\nResponse to comment 2:\nWe agree that at an abstract level, the pruning of noisy dataset idea is the same. However, there are fundamental differences between these works:\n1. The tasks are different, the referred paper by the reviewer is removing the false positives for relation extraction task and our work is removing false positives and false negatives for the entity detection task.\n2. The fundamental approach for these two different tasks is also different, where the referred work is a modeling approach and our being a heuristic approach.\n\nIt is possible to add a learning model to make certain decisions instead of a pure heuristic approach used in our framework. We consider this as a future work. This is also suggested by Reviewer 1.\n\nWe would like to mention here that the main contributions of this work are:\n1. An analysis that the existing coarsely annotated datasets such as CoNLL are not suitable to detect entity mentions in the context of FIGER and TypeNET type hierarchies. (Section 3)\n2. A framework to automatically construct quality datasets suitable for fine entity detection and typing. (Section 4)\n3. Establish the state-of-the-art baselines on FIGER and new manually annotated corpus which is much richer than FIGER evaluation corpus. (Section 5)\n\nAdditionally, in the final version, we will update the related work section incorporating a reference to the work suggested by the reviewer along with other works which are also similar at an abstract level. \n\n\nComment 3:\nDescription of the new datasets is missing\n\nResponse to comment 3:\nWe would like to specify that the generated datasets description is mentioned in Section 5, overview paragraph. We also report various statistics of the datasets in Table 2. We have updated the Section 5.2.2 to include a description of evaluation datasets.\n\nWe hope that our response will clarify your concerns.

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has attracted research interest as an approach for leveraging the hierarchical structure of a given task in reinforcement learning (RL). However, identifying the hierarchical policy structure that enhances the performance of RL is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose an HRL method that learns a latent variable of a hierarchical policy using mutual information maximization. Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling.  \nIn our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy.

FgER task can be decomposed into two subproblems: Fine entity detection and fine entity typing. TypeNET and Open-type fall into the latter category. Our work has shown that as the number of types increase, entity detection task becomes the bottleneck for FgER task. Existing works such as FIGER, TypeNet and open-type do not address this issue. We established this point in Section 3 and proposed a framework for generating datasets to remove the bottleneck for FIGER and TypeNET hierarchy. Our benchmarking experiments were focused on providing quality estimates for the generated datasets. Thus we kept the learning model fixed and varied the dataset to demonstrate that the generated dataset help learning model to generalized better.\n\nAdditionally, in the case of open-type, it is an elusive problem of detecting 10k+ types of entities as many of these types go beyond knowledge bases.\n\nWe hope that our response will clarify your concerns. \n'}		HylHE-9p6m	BkgFcO0Um4	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper45/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper45/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	H1enOAVBGE	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper45/Authors']	1548310672963		1548908555244	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper45/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']
100	1548310833143	{'title': 'Thanks for the review. Indeed the issues highlighted are important and we hope that our response will address these issues. ', 'comment': '\nComment 1:\nThe approach is tailored towards Wikipedia text.\n\nResponse to comment 1: \nWe agree that all our experiments use Wikipedia as a text source. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, only Wikipedia text exists in public domain that is highly interlinked to knowledge bases such as Freebase, DBpedia and WikiData. Our approach fundamentally requires a linked text corpus, and the current options are limited to Wikipedia only.\n\nAlso, we would like to mention here is that FIGER evaluation dataset consists of sentences sampled from news and specialized magazines (photography and veterinary domain). Thus, it has a different writing style as compared with Wikipedia text. In Table 4, we can observe that the entity detection model trained on our dataset outperforms models trained on other existing datasets. Hence, the learning model is able to generalize beyond the Wikipedia style text.\n\nFurther, for several other domains, such as scientific articles, conversation text, where directly utilizing the generated datasets might not yield good performance, we consider our datasets as a source dataset for transfer learning. The generated dataset is richer in entity types (1k+ from several domains) and is very large, which makes it a good candidate to use as a source dataset for transfer learning setting when the task is to do NER for a specific domain text.\n\nWe have updated the discussion section (last paragraph) and 5.2.4 section (3rd paragraph, last sentence) to reflect this view.\n\n\nComment/Question 2:\nAre discarded and retained sentences fundamentally same or different? \n\nResponse to comment/question 2:\nThis is an interesting question. To answer the question we analyzed the discarded and retained sentences on the following parameters:\n1. Are the discarded sentences longer on average?\n2. Does the entity mention in discarded sentences longer on average?\n3. Is there a fundamental change in the token and entity mention distribution of discarded and retained sentences?\n\nThis analysis is added as Appendix B to the paper. The summary of the analysis is that, other than the sentence length distribution, there is not a significant change in other distributions. The mean sentence length in the retained corpus is around 22, whereas in the discarded corpus is around 27. \n\nNote that, this result has a subtle interpretation. We observe that in the discarded sentences, there are more than 100k sentences with the length greater than 100 tokens. In fact, a corpus constituting of only these longer sentences is larger than several news-domain NER datasets. We observe that the majority of these sentences are caused due to incorrect sentence segmentations or they follow a list like patterns such as:\n1. PER, PER, PER, PER, PER …\n2. PER - PER - PER - PER - PER …\n3. Director (Movie), Director (Movie), Director (Movie), ....\n4. Project (year), project (year), project (year), …\n5. NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER … \n6. Movie (year), movie (year), movie (year), …\n7. PER | PER | PER | PER | PER ...\n\nThe largest sentence length in discarded sentences is 6564 tokens!! \n\nOur dataset also captures these long sentences but the number is far less: 7664 sentences with the length greater than 100. The largest sentence length in the retained sentences is 624 tokens. \n\nAlthough, being a basic analysis, the analysis conveys that these longer sentences might not be suitable for applications where NER systems are used. To support this claim, we plotted the sentence length distribution of five NER datasets from different domains in Figure 7 and 8. The result conveys that, sentences longer than 100 words occur rarely in these domains and the sentence length distribution in the retained sentences is closer to the sentence length distribution in these domains when compared with the discarded sentences.\n\n\nComment 3: \nscales to thousands of types is a bit overstatement\n\nResponse to comment 3:\nWe agree with the reviewer that the current experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the framework for up to 1.1k types. We would like to add on this that the Freebase (which has 1.1k entity types) can be replaced with WikiData (which as 15k entity types) in the HAnDS framework to generate a training dataset constituting of 15k entity types. However, since we don’t have any empirical results on this, we will modify the scalability claim in the paper.\n\n\nWe hope that our response will provide a better insight into the proposed work and will clarify your concerns.\n'}		HylHE-9p6m	BylF4KALQ4	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper45/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper45/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	4		['everyone']	HyelSNY5gE	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper45/Authors']	1548310833143		1548907162146	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper45/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Moreover, we propose a novel information extraction method that obtains reliable factual information from Web-crawled data on the basis of distant supervision. Our constructed knowledge base is already utilized in real-world Japanese Web services, and the number of entities in it keeps growing steadily.', 'pdf': '/pdf/2a84263819598ce1b740d43a98bc3ef10b946240.pdf', 'archival status': 'Non-Archival', 'subject areas': ['Information Extraction', 'Databases', 'Knowledge Representation', 'Semantic Web'], 'paperhash': 'anonymous|mermaid_productionlevel_knowledge_base_construction_system', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019mermaid:,    \ntitle={MERMAID: Production-level Knowledge Base Construction System},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \nbooktitle={Submitted to Automated Knowledge Base Construction},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJxfV-q6Tm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}'}		SJxfV-q6Tm	SJxfV-q6Tm	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	44	SJlXskAqam	['everyone']		['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']	1542459690173		1548896870341	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']
106	1548886496097	{'pros': '- The paper addresses an important problem, namely the defense of CNNs against adversarial attacks.\n\n- In this context, the proposed architecture and strategy seem to be novel.\n\n- A thorough series of experiments is proposed, in particular in terms of internal baselines which include ablation studies and experiments studying the effect of the hyperparameters balancing the introduced losses.', 'cons': '- Two important references are missing from my point of view:\n\n(1) Vincent et al [a] proposed a very similar training of denoising auto-encoders which also optimizes the quality of the reconstruction of synthetically deformed samples. The obtained feature representations were demonstrated to improve the performance of classifiers subsequently using them.\n\n(2) In Ghifary et al [b], a similar architecture was proposed where an auto-encoder and a CNN sharing its encoding layers are jointly trained. The context in [b] is however different (unsupervised domain adaptation).\n\nTaking these works into account, I believe that the novelty of the proposed mechanism is a bit lower than claimed. It is not necessarily a problem since the current paper addresses the different scenario of adversarial attacks, but the paper still has to be revised accordingly.\n\n- Most importantly, I am concerned about some parts of the evaluation and the reported results. Indeed, for the huge majority of proposed defenses, it seems that the adversarial examples from the C&W attack based on (Carlini & Wagner, 2017) are surprisingly weak: in fact, the accuracy of the targetted network on these adversarial examples is even higher than on the original unmodified examples, i.e. before running the attack. I might be misunderstanding something but I would at the very least expect an adversarial deformation of an example to do as good as the example it is based on, i.e. as good as doing nothing. This sounds like a quite odd result and should probably be double-checked – again, unless I missed something here.\n\n- I found that the paper has in general a few issues in terms of clarity, some of which are reflected in the points below. The English should also probably be revised before publication, but I did not feel that the language itself was an issue to understand the paper.\n\n- The paper mentions at several places (abstract, Section 3.1 and Table 1) that, in addition to the two medical datasets, the evaluation was performed on a dataset of natural images (CIFAR10). However I could not find any results on this dataset. I believe the corresponding reference “(cif,2009)” also has an issue, and the two first references in the list of references are missing their authors or title.\n\n- This point is probably only due to a slight lack of clarity, but I find a bit misleading to say that the proposed approach is “independent of model structures” (in the abstract). Since the encoding layers of the auto-encoder are shared with the CNN, a given CNN architecture imposes the encoding layers, and it still must decided at which layer of the CNN one should create the branch towards the decoding layers. In this sense, the performance certainly depends on this choice and on the architecture of the original CNN. It is perfectly acceptable and I agree that the idea can be adapted to many architectures, but this still contrasts with (Liao et al. 2017) on Figure 2 where the denoising network and the CNN are completely separated, allowing to design fully independently the two architectures.\n\n- In the tables used for results, the numbers in bold do not always reflect the best performance for each column, which can be misleading.\n\n- The defense mechanism relies on synthetic deformations of training images, where a parameter \\sigma encodes the magnitude of the added deformations. I could not find how this parameter was set. Was it adjusted to the expected magnitude of each attack, or was it set once for all experiments? \n\n\n[a] Vincent et al, Stacked Denoising Autoencoders: Learning Useful Representations in a Deep Network with a Local Denoising Criterion, JMLR 2010\n[b] Ghifary et al, Deep Reconstruction-Classification Networks for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, ECCV 2016\n\n', 'rating': '2: reject', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}		rygMhHISx4	H1gOkfj1NV	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper159/Official_Review	[]	3		['everyone']	rygMhHISx4	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper159/AnonReviewer1']	1548886496097		1548886496097	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper159/AnonReviewer1']

(2). However, our results imply that using few iterations with learned weights outperforms a converged solution using heuristic weights.\nBecause our model optimizes accuracy, each point point in Fig, 4 corresponds not only to a different T but also to different learned weights, making it difficult to compare convergence across points.\nWhile bifurcation can potentially change the rate of convergence, it does not have to. Since the bifurcation parameters (\\theta^\\tau) are learned, and since \\theta^\\tau = 0 implies no change in rates, bifurcation will be used (by learning that \\theta^\\tau != 0) only if it results in better performance.\n\n“Is introducing entropy always helpful?”:\nSince the entropy parameters (\\theta^e) are learned, and because \\theta^e = 0 implies uniform weights (like in LP), the model will learn to use entropy only if it results in improved performance. The same applies to KL divergence.\n\n“Difference in experimental setting and results from GCN:”\nThe main differences between our setup and GCN are the number of labeled nodes and how they can be used. In GCN labeled nodes are partitioned into training (20 nodes per class) and validation (500 additional nodes). While training sets are kept small (3.6% for Citeseer, 5.2% for CoRA, and 0.3% for pubmed), the total number of labeled nodes (training+validation) is rather large (18.6%, 23.6%, and 2.8% of all nodes, respectively), and a huge portion of labeled nodes is pre-allocated for validation (81%, 78%, and 89% of labeled data, respectively) and so can only be used for tuning, not training. This puts methods that require little or no tuning (such as LP, over which our method is built) at an immediate disadvantage. \nIn our view, methods should be free to choose how to best use the available labeled data, be it for training, tuning, or other. We have experimented in the GCN setting, allowing our model to use all labeled data for training. While our model outperforms GCN (83.4 vs. 79.6 on CoRA and 69.8 vs. 67.5 on Citeseer, averaged over 10 random splits), this may also seem unfair, since other baselines might also benefit from a allocation of the labeled budget. There also several other issues with the “standard” setting used in GCN - see the recent paper by Shchur et al. (2018) [1] for details.\nDue to the above, our solution was to revert to the classic SSL experimental setting used in numerous papers, where a fixed percentage of labeled nodes are drawn uniformly at random. We used 1% as it is a reasonable number in the range of the GCN setting, and allowed us to fully train all baselines for all settings and datasets over 10 random splits in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n“Number of GCN layers:”\nWe use the published GCN code which has one graph-convolution layer and is used in their paper.\n\n“Too many hyperparameters to tune”:\nPlease note that we have only *one* network-related hyper-parameter that requires tuning - the number of layers (T). As Fig. 4 shows, choosing T can be made robust by using bifurcation. All other model parameters (denoted by \\theta) are learned. The regularization coefficient \\lambda is chosen by standard cross validation.\n\n“Minor points”:\nThank you for these, we will fix them.\n\n[1] Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S.

109	1543291412735	"{'title': 'Clarifications, justifications, and updates', 'comment': ""Thank you for your comments. Below please find details describing our modeling and experimental choices. The updated paper includes an enriched related materials section and GAT as a baseline. Fig. 4 quantifies the added value of the bifurcation component.\n\n“Total number of parameters, and compared to other methods?”\nThe total number of parameters is between 12 and 44, depending on dataset and experimental setting. Based on their published codes, GCN has 23,040 and GAT has 92,391 for CoRA. We use 38. These include:\n- Weights: 30 edge features, some are per-class (Appendix B)\n- Attention: 2 parameters per class, one for entropy and one for divergence (Sec. 3.1)\n- Bifurcation: 2 parameters (Eq. (13))\n\n“Relation to papers by Saha et al. and Cilberto et al.”:\nThe above papers propose methods for multi-task learning (Saha et. al for online, Ciliberto et al. for batch), and consider relations between tasks, which are fixed and given as input. Our paper focuses on semi-supervised learning, and considers weighted relations between examples, which are learned.\n\n“Discern contribution of learning the weights vs propagating labels instead of embeddings”:\nThe LP baseline, which we generalize, propagates labels with fixed weights. Fig. 4 shows the how adding bifurcation (LPN_bif) compares to only learning weights (LPN_nobif).\n\n“Please specify that \\theta are learned”:\nWe will clarify this.\n\n“Entropy and divergence - inversely proportional?”:\nWe use *negative* entropy and *negative* divergence (see Eq. (11) and above). This aligns with your intuition.\n\n“Use threshold for rounding instead of bifurcation”:\n“Hard” rounding is non-differentiable, and cannot be used efficiently with back-propagation. Bifurcation is differentiable, and much more expressive than simple rounding. It can interpolate between “rounding up” (large \\tau) and “rounding down” to uniform (\\tau-->zero), or result in no rounding (\\tau=1). \n\n“Are a, b tuned using cross-validation? Can't we learn them?”:\nBoth a and b (=\\theta^\\tau) are learned, not tuned.\n\n“Can’t the loss in Eq. (14) be replaced by the standard empirical loss?”:\nUnfortunately, no. With the standard empirical loss, Eq. (14) becomes degenerate. This is because the it compares the true and predicted labels of the labeled nodes. As in LP, predicted labels of labeled nodes are set to their true labels, so the loss is always 0. This is also noted in Zhang & Lee (2007).\n\n“If available, how are node features used?”:\nNode features are used to parameterize edge weights (Eq. (7) & appendix B). Sec. 2.2 now includes more details.\n\n“Why is k chosen to be equal to 1%?”:\nWe chose 1% as it is a reasonable number in the range of those used in GCN and others (3.6%, 5.2%, and 0.3%). Note that we re-train all baselines on all datasets over 10 random splits in two experimental settings, which requires considerable computational resources.\n\n“Reduce features to avoid overfitting”:\nThe overall number of parameters we use is very small, especially compared to other methods. We observed that reducing the number of features only degrades performance.\n\n“Differences from GCN”:\nThere are several notable differences, most of which become apparent when comparing the form of classifiers proposed by each method. The classifier of GCN is f(x, W; \\theta), while ours is f(y; W(x; \\theta)). This means that:\n- GCN operates on features, while we propagate labels. The benefit of propagating labels is that labeled information is used not only to penalize wrong predictions (in the loss), but also to *generate* predictions. This is the hallmark of the LP algorithm, which we adopt.\n- GCN assumes edge weights W are given as input. These are typically set heuristically. In contrast, our method learns weights by optimizing predictive accuracy.\n- GCN uses node features x to generate embeddings, and hence does not apply to tasks where node features are not available. For our method, when features are available, we use them to parametrize W. When they are not available, we use the information-gated attention mechanism.\n\n“No comparison to GraphSage:”\nGraphSage applies to an inductive learning setting. Our method is designed for a transductive learning setting.\n\n“Explain ‘LPN_nobif degrades with large T’”:\nFig. 4 shows that without bifurcation, accuracy can be sensitive to T. Adding bifurcation provides robustness. This is true even when the effects of bifurcation are subtle (\\tau~=1).\n\n“Trend in Table 1; why is performance poor for Flickr?”:\nFlickr is dense compared to others (edge/node ratio of 60:1, vs. between 1.5:1 and 5.3:1). To reduce the computational load, we sparsify the graph, which may explain the low accuracy.\n\n“Uncertainty estimates”:\nNow added.""}"		r1g7y2RqYX	S1l6GGSqR7	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper972/Official_Comment	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper972/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	HJxISgAn2m	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper972/Authors']	1543291412735		1548885340496	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper972/Authors', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

The attention mechanism turns incoming soft labels (h^t) into edge weights (a^{t+1}). For given parameters \\theta^\\alpha, the attention function \\alpha is indeed fixed, but since soft labels change as they pass through the layers, so do the edge weights. When viewed as a label-propagation mechanism, weights can be thought of as changing over time.\n\n“What is \\theta^\\tau in Eq. (13):\n\\theta^\\tau is defined just above Eq. (13) - it is simply the concatenation of a and b. The left hand side can be written as \\tau(t;a,b). In general, we use \\theta to denote parameters, and the corresponding superscript to denote what they parameterize. We will make this clearer.\n\n“The term ‘time’ is misleading”:\nWe apologize for this inclarity. Indeed, we use time, iterations, and number of layers (or depth) interchangeably. This is because the network’s layers simulate the iterations of LP, which we think of as applied over time. We will clarify this.\n\n“How are raw features incorporated in the loss?”:\nWe use “raw” features to parameterize edge weights. This means that the weight w_{ij} of an edge (i,j) is a function of various edge measures \\phi_{ij}, some of which are derived from raw node features (see appendix B). The function is parameterized by \\theta^\\phi - the exact form is given in Eq. (7). Edge weights then determine the predicted labels (through the label propagation mechanism), and predictions are plugged into the loss function in Eq. (14), where they are evaluated against the ground-truth labels.\n'}		r1g7y2RqYX	rkg5ufBcAQ	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper972/Official_Comment	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper972/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	4		['everyone']	rJxDdu4A37	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper972/Authors']	1543291506442		1548885328945	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper972/Authors', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

Previous methods of SF-RL mainly based on DQN architectures and they not highlight any zero shot transfer learning ability. \n\n2. Previous networks have used an autoencoder loss to learn the state representation(Kulkarni et al., Zhan et al.) while training on the DQN task. This can add some instability to the system when the state representation is complex. Barreto et al. (2018) have replaced state representation vectors by assuming the current state as a linear combination of scalar rewards to set of base tasks. With Barreto et al. there should be some base tasks.  Ma et al. have introduced USF idea first where the state representation vector is extracted from an Auto-encoder.  When working with visual states, this can be troublesome. Contrasting to previous work on SF-RL and USF-RL  Authors have used a more straightforward way to predict the state representation with USF which is more scalable. \n\n3. In SF-RL previous work the reward prediction vector also trained by regressing scalar rewards while training on the DQN baseline. In the USF-RL (Ma et al) introduced a goal-oriented reward vector is produced by a neural network that takes the goal as the input. However, still its hard to train the goal-oriented reward vector prediction network due to the sparsity of the reward structure. Because in an example task of navigation, once the training starts agent will see many negative rewards for a long time and decidedly less positive rewards (If its A3C the network will get updated by many agents ).  This makes the training weights of the network unstable. In this paper, authors proposed to use scalar rewards as it is and trained the reward vector prediction network with Q loss.\n\n4.  This combined the general value function approximates(GVFA) with  USF which is useful for the large-scale deep reinforcement learning frameworks like A3C. Because in A3C we can train different agents on different goals. Let's say in a navigation task with different targets, and we can train this whole architecture while learning general patterns.  \n\n\nI also have few questions regarding to train this with complex representations like images for a task of navigation in robotics. \n\n\n1. Let's say we have a fixed number of targets where each target is sentimentally different from each other, and both the states and targets are represented in images.  So mainly in the architecture proposed by authors, we need to have CNNs for goal embedding, state embedding and reward vector prediction network. How to proceed with this kind of situation ? is it scalable? \n\n2. Do we maintain two CNNs for state embedding network and goal embedding network ?  Cant we use same networks which is more like a Siamese network?  I think this can be a problem when training since practically we only train with given number of goals. \n\n3.

To calculate the advantage in A3C, we need a scalar reward at each time steps. If we replace scalar reward as a linear combination of state representations the A3C agent can get unstable because we use the advantage to update the policy directly.

This was a major challenge until recently, when provable algorithms for dictionary learning were proposed. Yet, these provide guarantees only on the recovery of the dictionary, without explicit recovery guarantees on the coefficients. Moreover, any estimation error in the dictionary adversely impacts the ability to successfully localize and estimate the coefficients. This potentially limits the utility of existing provable dictionary learning methods in applications where coefficient recovery is of interest.

This is an interesting application of deep learning to 3D point clouds, as opposed to the more traditionally encountered image-based segmentation.\n\n- The paper is clearly written. In particular I found the work to be strongly motivated in the introduction by a clear presentation of the specific properties and challenges of the addressed application.\n\n- The proposed method and evaluation seem sound.\n\n- The two contributions introduced in the paper are well validated, both against external baselines and individually through an ablation study. The evaluation confirms the positive impact of each contribution on the segmentation performance.', 'cons': '- One of the two contributions, namely the addition of a discriminative network during training to structure the prediction, is insufficiently discussed in comparison to the previous works. The idea of using an adversarial training which differentiates realistic from unrealistic label configurations was already introduced in several works, starting (I believe) with Luc et al [a]. Multiple additional references for medical applications are for example available in the introduction and related work sections of the paper (Ghafoorian et al, 2018). However, although (Ghafoorian et al, 2018) is mentioned in the Methods section, none of these works are mentioned in the introduction or the related work, which I found to be misleading regarding the novelty of this contribution.\n\n- The adversarial network is based on simple features extracted from the predicted labels (mean and variance of 3D voxel positions for each class). While this is technically indeed a novelty, I find this aspect to go a bit against the end-to-end claim, since it amounts to handcrafting features in the label space before applying a multilayer perceptron. This contrasts for example with [a] where a network is trained end-to-end to learn how a realistic label prediction should look like, possibly discovering high-level criteria related for example to object shapes, etc. Even if using these features might be perfectly sound for this application, I find that this is not motivated enough in comparison to the existing end-to-end approaches (which also goes back to the previous point), and rather in contradiction with the narrative of the paper.  The limitations of handcrafted features are indeed regularly pointed out in “Related work”.\n\n- The lack of universal coordinate system is mentioned as a challenge for this clinical application, for example in “Discussion and conclusion”. However, the features in the label space used to discriminate realistic from unrealistic labels include the means of 3D coordinates. Does not this possibly break the invariance with respect to the choice of coordinate system? I wonder whether using pairwise distances between classes, i.e. pairwise differences of means instead of the means directly, would be more suitable to guarantee an invariance to the choice of coordinates directly in the feature representation.\n\n\n[a]  Luc et al, Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Network, NIPS Workshop 2016\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- If the extracted statistical features are sufficient, it might be worth training a simpler and more interpretable adversarial classifier than a multilayer perceptron – maybe simply a logistic regression? This would give a better understanding on how the notion of realistic segmentation output is encoded.\n\n- I wonder if the discriminator could not be used at prediction time as well, in addition to structuring the training. Could it for example provide a confidence measure on the output?\n\n- In general, I believe it is better to avoid using an ArXiV reference when the work was published and peer-reviewed, as is for example the case with the PointCNN paper (Li et al 2018).', 'rating': '3: accept', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}		ByxLSoblgV	HkgcroPJNE	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper65/Official_Review	[]	3		['everyone']	ByxLSoblgV	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper65/AnonReviewer2']	1548872514171		1548872514171	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper65/AnonReviewer2']

For example, the extraction (John, FatherOf, Sally) may be incomplete given the corpus “John took his Daughter Sally to school” (as he may have more children), but complete with regards to the corpus “John has a single child, named Sally”.\nFirst it outlines possible uses for such a metric (inform a user that they should look for more information, decide where to invest search resources, etc.), and then describes an evaluation framework of Open IE4 using WikiData. \nFollowing, the metric is assessed both automatically and manually, and an empirical use-case of the metric is presented (knowledge base completion)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading the paper, I find the task is very interesting and well presented, and I can see the uses of such a metric.\n\nMy main objection is in the way the actual metric is compute:\n“A text  snippet is considered to be complete, and labelled as such, if we can match alias names for all objects found in Wiki-data. It is labelled as incomplete otherwise.” (Section 4, p. 8)\n\nDoesn’t this defeat the purpose of evaluating against the “real world”?\nInstead, I think that the described process conflates evaluation of two resources: while aiming to evaluate only an Open IE system, it also evaluates the completeness of the knowledge base & paraphrase dictionary, which may be incomplete. This is also acknowledged in the paper (“KBs such as WikiData have many gaps where they are incomplete”) p. 13) . For example, if WikiData doesn’t have all children of Barack Obama as facts, it may label a text saying “Barack Obama took his daughter Malia to school” as complete. \n\nInstead, i expected from the (excellent) intro to have a linguistic indication that such sentences are in fact incomplete, and hinting that there may be additional information somewhere.\n\nIn addition If the process of getting the distant supervision is fully automatic, why limit it to only 5 relations?\n\nIf this is indeed the case, I think that this should be made much clearer that the current work doesn’t actually address the real-world coverage of IE systems, but rather matches them against a KB.\n\nI’d be happy to raise my score if I got something wrong with respect the use of WikiData for labelling completeness of the extracted tuples.\n\n', 'rating': '7: Good paper, accept', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}		HkgAyb5aaQ	rkgsleJDxE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper18/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper18/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	HkgAyb5aaQ	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper18/AnonReviewer1']	1545166835283		1548868073201	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

We empirically observe that CONCAT operator for relations is significantly affected by the pairwise similarities of the corresponding words a and c, b and d for (a, b) and (c, d) word-pairs [1]. For relation prediction task in our work, we alleviate the effect of getting high relational similarity scores due to attributional similarities by excluding the 25% nearest pairs for each stem using cross-pair attributional similarity scores given by Equation 6. However, in measuring the degree of relational similarities and compare them with the human scores we did not consider such pre-processing step because of the nature of this evaluation is different than the relation prediction. In Chen dataset, there are many word-pairs that are assigned higher relational scores (human scores) than others because of the similarities between the corresponding entities in pairs. For example, (animal, pig) and (insect, ant) got 6.33 compared to (animal, pig) and (song, opera) that scored 4.3. It was also consistent with a closely related task measuring degrees of prototypicality in a recent work by Jameel, et al (2018) wherein PairDiff and Concat report 0.173 and 0.167 Spearman correlations, respectively [2]. \xa0\n\n2--\tFirst we want to note that this result is consistent with a recent comparative study by Hakami and Bollegala (2017). In [3] it has been shown that CBOW embeddings with unsupervised PairDiff operator perform the best for relation representations compared to various embedding types among many relational datasets. Similarly, Levy et al. (2015) show that CBOW (and SG) are better than GloVe in most cases for Google and MSR relational dataset using 3CosAdd and 3CosMult pair-based operators for answering analogical questions [4]. \xa0\n-\tThe GloVe objective for learning word embeddings aims to reduce the difference between the dot product of the vectors of the two words and the log of their co-occurrence. Thus, GloVe model is trained on the word-context co-occurrence matrix instead of the text corpus. According to this, GloVe is close to traditional word representation methods such as LSA that factorizing a word-context co-occurrence matrix. On the other hand, the CBOW objective seeks to predict a target word from its surrounding context.\xa0This difference in the objective between GloVe and CBOW might make sense for the superiority of CBOW prediction word embedding to capture informative information to induce relations between words. \n-\tThis work was not aimed to compare the embedding types, instead, we wanted to show that the proposed MnnPL method for representing relations is performing well across various type of word embeddings. Despite this, we train all the models on the same corpus to make a fair comparison to some extent. It is also known that hyperparameters tuning and pre-processing (or post-processing) are affecting the performance of such word embedding models. We also carry out our experiments using the 300 dimensional pre-trained publicly available GloVe and CBOW embeddings and it turns out that again CBOW outperforms GloVe for our tasks.\xa0\n\n3--\tIn BATS dataset, the semantic relations are classified to encyclopaedic and lexicographic where we show the performance on each relation type. On the other hand, as shown in Appendix A (table 5), all the semantic relations in DiffVec are lexicographic.\xa0\n\nReferences:\n[1] Turney, Peter D.

With Bayes by backprop we have indeed experienced that it was necessary to tune priors, to adjust the learning rate to compensate for the increased stochasticity (less robust training) and even to weight the complexity term (KL to the prior) in the case of non-iid data (dependent pixels, augmentations, etc). I would appreciate very much if the authors could comment on the following questions.\n\n(1) The heteroskedastic model predicting mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution is a bit unclear to me. In the Bayesian predictive distribution there is variance Sigma_{mm} coming from the uncertainty of parameters and the variance e^{l} learned as a part of the model. In case of a large training sample, Sigma_{mm} approaches zero and the predictive distribution (9) to the ML plug-in. However, we are interested to see the effect of the Bayesian learning, the quality of estimating Sigma_{mm}, i.e. in the case of a small training sample. I am not sure this is the case in Fig 3. It looks like ML would give a similar predictive distribution and the Bayesian Sigma_{mm} and especially Sigma_{ll} are small corrections on top of that. Does it really show the utility of the method? \nWhat is further confusing, is that the whole difference between Sigma_{mm} and e^{l} is that the former is not fitting the predictive model to the data whereas the later is, otherwise technically they are replaceable, at least Sigma_{mm} can implement e^{l} with some extra neurons and noisy weights.\n\n(2) The paper mentions that ""strong test performance of DVI is largely retained by dDVI"" and ""dDVI surprisingly retains much of the performance"". However, the only experiment relevant to this is the model with one hidden layer (Table 2). The only non-zero covariance term in this case is Sigma_{m,l} for the output unit, which by the way is only appears in the expected likelihood (8) but not in the predictive probability (9). So the two methods may be expected to be nearly identical. Accounting for correlations is one main technical contribution of the work. It would be really interested to know whether such accounting for correlations is important in deeper models. And, more broadly, whether restricting the space of models to such where activations given the input are uncorrelated and learning a model in this space is in any way inferior.\n\n(3) A follow up on the question from the referees ""who cares about test likelihood"". Could you suggest to researchers interested in BNNs what would be a more practically relevant and accessible to non-experts set of experiments to test the quality of the learned probabilistic model for both regression and classification?

From a classical point of view rotation invariant convolution layers can be obtained with filters that are isotropic. This is a rather limiting viewpoint and the current submission nicely extends the class of invariant CNN layers by defining a locally rotation invariant filter by a roto-translation lifting convolution (see work on group convolutions networks) directly followed by a max-pooling over rotations. Such layers are based on non-isotropic filters and can be efficiently implemented by defining convolution kernels in polar coordinates, relying on spherical harmonics.\n\nThe theory is well explained and contains interesting details that are also valuable from a practical point of view. Although not validated on very large datasets (and with minimal architecture design), the experiments are carefully setup and convincingly demonstrate the potential of the proposed way of dealing with rotationally invariant feature/texture descriptors.\n\nMy recommendation is to accept the submission.\n', 'cons': 'Overall I really enjoyed reading the paper. In this section I provide some minor comments and suggestions. \n\nSmall fixes:\n\nTypo on page 2 “first convolution layer, what exploits” -> “first convolution layer, that/which exploits”\n\nI found the introduction of 2.4 confusing in the transition from h_i being a 1D function (from \\mathbb{R} to \\mathbb{R}) to its voxelized version (from \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}) with the mention of isotropy constraint. I don’t see this as a constrained as by definition \\rho = \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert is isotropic. What I think is important here is that the radial profile extends all the way to the corners of  3D kernel, and this then sets the number of trainable parameters in h_i (with unit voxel distance spacing). Perhaps this can be clarified?\n\nFigure 2 (which nicely illustrates the above) raises the following question: the last weights in the h_i vector only affect the corners of the 3D kernel and therefore some “voxel features” only appear at diagonal rotations, doesn’t this affect the invariance you aim for? The shape of the kernel is not isotropic and therefore it is not truly rotation invariant. True rotation invariance could be achieved by limiting \\rho leq (c-1)/2 (so the corners are always zero).\n\nI really appreciated the short comment on the angular Nyquist frequency, these things are good to realize when working with the actual code.\n\nPage 6 regarding padding, this is zero padding?\n\nMinor comments:\n\n[Just a remark for a possible interesting extension (intro of section 2)] Regarding the action of SO(3) on R^3 and S^2:, for an example of efficient spherical harmonics implementations of SO(3) acting on axially symmetric functions on S^2 also see citation [2] below.\n\nAfter Eq.(1), you could possibly identify “I*f(R\\cdot)” as a lifting group-convolution (see e.g. Cohen et al. or [5] below), followed by sub-group pooling (max of rotations).\n\nPage 5 after Eq. 6. A nice property of expanding each filter in the same basis is that you can pre-filter the input whit your set of basis-functions separately and then combine the results with the corresponding coefficients to create all feature maps. \nThe second to last paragraph of section 4 sounds contradicting and could be rewritten: “the improvement… of SH convolution is limited … yet a significant increase in accuracy”.\n\nFinally I would like to mention some very related work both on steerable filters and local rotation invariance which could be addressed in the submission.\n\nFor work on (optimal) 3D steerable filters in texture analysis: See e.g. [1] (and references therein) for a recent overview and toolkit for 3D steerable image filtering. See e.g. [2] for (optimal) steerable filter construction/fitting for axially symmetric texture detection in 3D medical image data. In [2] additional axial symmetry is exploited to further reduce the number of SH coefficients and it makes rotation over your \\gamma redundant. This essentially boils down to relying on Fourier transforms/irreducible representations on the sphere S^2 (<> quotient group SO(3)/SO(2)), see e.g. the book by Chirikjian and Kyatkin [3] and [4].\n\nFollowing up on your discussion paragraph on page 8 regarding LRI in relation to the work in the group-CNN context by Cohen et al.: In addition to the already cited work by Weiler et al. 2017 the works described in [5] and [6] are very related to the current proposal in two ways. (1) In these papers the construction of local invariance is also studied by following “lifting convolutions” (creating feature maps in a higher-dimensional position-rotation space) by max-pooling over rotations. In these works this has been done with additional group convolution layers in between the lifting and rotation-pooling layers (creating local rotation invariance over the net receptive field size). (2) In [5] and Weiler et al. 2017 the authors describe a similar behavior as observed in Table 1: a higher angular resolution improves performance. A main advantage of your method is the very high efficiency in dealing with trainable parameters, however, it should be noted that neither in [5] nor the method of Weiler et al. the number of trainable parameters increases with angular resolution when only a lifting layer directly followed by a rotation pooling is considered.\n\nThe work by Mallat et al is very much concerned with both local and global rotation invariances in image data (see e.g. the Ph.D. thesis by L.

I do have some concerns however regarding the experiment, which may bias the experiment in favor of the proposed approach (see comment below). Nevertheless, I very much appreciate the creativity of this paper and the ambition to solve the above mentioned challenges in medical image analysis.\n\nI recommend accept conditional to minor changes/clarifications.', 'cons': 'I put all my minor and major comments and suggestions in this section.\n\nThe paper puts a lot of emphasis on context aggregation, however, to me it is not completely clear how this is achieved. The authors mention that they rely on graph CNNs on which they perform pooling (via graph diffusions), but there is no explanation of how this contributes to a higher contextual “understanding” of the data. I would appreciate it if this were somewhere in the document explained (preferably in the introduction).\n\nA related issue is the following. In the conclusion the following is mentioned: “we showed that GCNNs can successfully mimic … UNet-like encoder-decoder architectures of pooling global context information”. I think that this sentence in a way down-plays your own work. I don’t think it was the goal to mimic UNets, but I also don’t directly see how it mimics the context aggregation features of UNet type architectures other than that there is some global information analysis going on. The UNets are hierarchical in nature (it is in this sense not unique, there are many other multi-scale analysis approaches in MedIA) and I don’t think this hierarchical nature is apparent in this paper. As far as I can tell, the method works “only” on two levels (though quite effectively): at pixel level (structure head) and global level (graph based semantic head).\n\nFinally, regarding context aggregation. Could you explain in what way context is exploited. I have a feeling that the semantic head sort of has a function of telling the structure head “hey, I am pretty confident that you can correctly predict this class in this region, but I am not going to let you contribute to the segmentation in this region”, but I’m not fully sure that this is the idea behind this splitting. In a naïve way, you could also just let the semantic head spit out confidence scores of 1 for each location and each class (it is then a standard Hough voting). It would be nice if the motivation for the design was better explained in the paper.\n\nIn the related work section of the introduction the transition to work on graphs comes a bit out of the blue. Up to that point there is no mention that the proposed work relies on graph CNNs. Perhaps the introduction could be improved by mentioning up-front the general idea of the paper?\n\nDue to some missing details in the paper on graph CNNs I went to study the references of this paper and found that the embedding of some these references in the introduction is not fully correct. It is suggested that the works of Henaff et al. [H] and Kipf and Welling [KW] aim for local support of spectral filters in response to the work by Bruna et al. [B], which supposedly doesn’t have this property. In [B] the filters are indeed localized (localization is obtained through smoothness in the spectral domain) and the main contribution of [H] is not to enable local support (they do rely on results of [B]) but rather to describe theory for constructing graphs when they are not yet defined a priori, and they additionally nicely present/summarize the framework for graph-CNNs. A large part in [KW] is indeed concerned with locality of the spectral filters. Instead of relying on splines (as is done in [B] and [H]), [KW] rely truncated Chebyshev polynomials based on the work of Hammond et al. (2011), and describe clear properties of this approach regarding the support size of the graph filters.\n\nThere is a serious typo in the first equation. In the definition of the adjacency matrix the 2 \\sigma^2 should be within the exponential. If it is outside, as it is now, the sigma does not have any effect on the graph other than scaling all weights (this scaling is for example undone in the Laplace operator D^{-1}A and is also undone by simple scaling of the graph convolution kernels). \n\nSmall suggestion: In the second equation either the \\alpha or \\beta can be omitted (only one parameter is sufficient to balance between the two terms). \n\nStart of section 2.2.: Could you explain why you designed the network in such a way (parallel structure and semantic head). In principle you don’t need the semantic head for Hough voting, but it does seem to improve the results. Some intuition would be appreciated.\n\nOn page 5 you describe the pooling of features on a graph. At first it was not apparent to my how this is done, but I believe the approach is a sort of equivalent of average pooling in classical CNNs (except for the down-sampling part, which is not done in this work). Perhaps this link, or some intuition, could be provided in the paper.\n\nRegarding the diffusion process I would personally find an intuitive explanation more important that trying to describe the mathematics of it, especially because I have the feeling that the provided matrix L is incorrect (see also your own work Hansen et al. 2018 for definitions of L). The part about the “diffusion matrix” on page 5 is unclear: You provide a matrix which I believe is usually referred to as “transition matrix” in Brownian motion processes. This matrix could be used to define a Laplacian operator L=I – D^{-1}A, which in turn can be used to describe a diffusion process (p\uf0dfp+L.p). I have several problems with this paragraph: 1. There is probably a typo (a missing identity matrix) and 2. The section does not describe how this matrix is used, 3. nor does it provide intuition (e.g. you pool features by means of graph smoothing, similar to average pooling in standard CNNs). I had to dive into spectral theory on graphs to understand what you meant in this section.\n\nIn the experimental setup (on page 6) you describe that class weighting was not applied. I think this choice could have a quite severe effect on you experiments. In neither of the networks in this paper you deal with the disbalance of labels. The fact that the U-net underperforms could be due to the lack of balancing the data/losses. See also figure 3, where the small bladder is completely ignored by the U-net. Of course it could also be that your method is more robust against this disbalance (possibly due to the sampling strategy). This would indeed be a good thing, but it is not addressed in the paper. For me this leaves the impression that I cannot really tell if your method is intrinsically better, or that it is just less sensitive to unbalanced data.\n\nThe sigma parameters is set very small (0.1).

The idea is inspired by the success of ORB (Oriented fast and Rotational Brief), and provides an interesting approach to equip CNNs with a method to deal with rotation invariance/equivariance. The experimental results are in favor of the proposed CNNs over classical CNNs.', 'cons': 'This section contains all minor and major comments and suggestions.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend to accept this submission based on the following: \n– citations are sometimes incorrect or missing and I find some statements in the manuscript to be disrespectful \n– the authors makes claims which are not supported by the paper, nor by citations \n– the core method itself is not clearly described (I’m left with a lot of unanswered questions).\n\n[Introduction]\n\nThe introduction starts good, it is quite ambitions and identifies some core challenges in AI based image analysis: “… there is still a lack of knowledge on the emergence of concrete interactions within the network”, “..it might be advisable to optimize the network’s choice of transformation itself..”. However, I do not see why some of the challenges are mentioned, or how these are solved. In fact, it left me a bit confused and it gave me the impression that it was somewhat contradictive. A lot of it regards invariance to unknown transformations and it is suggested that you should not assume too many invariances a priori. It is suggested that in this paper these problems are addressed on a generic level, however, I found the paper to be highly specific to rotation invariance only (an a priori choice), which contradicts the grant view posed in the paragraphs before.\n\nThe paragraph on encoding rotation invariance into NNs is a bit weak. It misses some key publications. For a very recent overview see e.g. [1]. Related work on spatial transformer networks (see e.g. [2]) and group theoretical approaches are missing. For theory see e.g. [1,3,4]. For successful applications (and theory) in medical imaging see e.g. [5,6], in addition to the ones you already have. Furthermore, when citing work on steerable filters in CNNs I think [7] deserve an explicit mention as well. \n\nI also don’t think it is correct to say that Weiler et al. 2017 is based on the work of Jacob and Unser (they are not even cited in Weiler et al. 2017). Jacob and Unser have made great impact in the computer vision field with steerable filters, and I think they do deserve a cite, but when doing so, I think it is fair to also acknowledge the ones that actually came up with the notion of steerable filters in computer vision in 1991: Freeman and Adelson [8]. \n\nI also found the statement in the last paragraph on page 2 dubious: “While a) *unintentionally* reduces the effective network capacity…”. What is meant here? As far as I understand from the above mentioned methods is that the transformation invariances/equivariances are explicitly made part of the network architecture such that the networks do not need to learn for geometric relations. E.g., the network does not need to learn rotated copies and network capacity becomes available for learning tasks specific representations, thereby increasing performance. I think this effect is neither “unintentional” nor does it reduce network capacity, it in fact increases it.\n\n\n[2. Materials and methods]\n\n\n(punctuation is missing, in particular (3) and (4) should end with a “.”)\n\nTypo on page 3 “the belief that data amount might”, “data amount”->”the amount of data”?\n\nThe last sentence of the intro of 2: “With our approach … a matter of the network optimization process”? I don’t understand this statement. From my point of view it is more a matter of network design than a network optimization process.\n\nThe sentence before (3) is logically not correct. The moments do not allow for rotation (you can rotate patches without any need for moments). A representative orientation can be derived using the moments and this orientation can be used to rotate the patches.\n\nEq. (3) describes a way of estimating a global patch orientation. I expect however that this angle is highly sensitive to global (low-freq) intensity variations. The given angle is essentially the angle that the center of mass makes w.r.t. the origin. If this center and the origin coincide this angles does not even exist, and if they are close I expect a high uncertainty on the angle. \n\n“generalization to the n-dimensional case is straightforward”, such statements should not be made lightly unless you have a good citation to support this. Already in the case n=3 you’d have to make decisions in how to couple orientations (in S^2, which has 2 parameters) with rotations (in SO(3) which has three parameters).\n\n\n“Further approaches could include a learned transformation”. Also here I think such extensions are not trivial at all and do not follow directly from the work presented here. I have several problems with this: \n1.\tYou do not provide any details to support this statement (except for a reference to section 4 which basically repeats this statement)\n2.\tYou could of course try to learn this transformation matrix (which is essentially happening in spatial transformer networks (STNs) [2]), but I understood that the whole point of using matrix (4) was that it is parameterized by a rotation which you “know” (or at least are able to estimate), you cannot estimate more general parameters in the same way you estimate orientation.\n\n\nEq. (5) gives a description of the rotationally invariant layer, which includes a convolution of weight matrix W with an image patch. To me this equation is confusing since the difference in notation between weights (capitalized) and patches (lowercase) suggest that they are different data types. You could clarify (5) by also mentioning the size of W (which is k x k?). Am I right that (5) specifies a fully connected layer? (the patches have the same size as W)\n\n\nLet’s assume p is larger than the convolution kernels. Then I have a problem with interpreting the framework: The rotation invariance is global (first the entire patch is rotated and then a standard conv is applied). In the next layer, the full input is rotated and then again a conv is applied. How does this work on full image level, e.g. in the U-nets? If now again the full image is rotated then you completely destroy locality property and structure of the convolutions. E.g. a rotation of 180 degree’s moves a pixel all the way to the other side of the image, and if the feature maps are rotated independently of each other you completely miss spatial correspondences. I am probably missing something here, but this is as much I can make from the presented methodology. A clearer, less ambiguous, explanation of the methodology would have been helpful.\n\n\nThis brings me to my next question. You choose to go for a hybrid approach. What happens if you go fully rotation invariant? (non-hybrid)\n\n\nWhat happens if you do not additionally provide the values sin \\theta(x,y), cos\\theta(x,y) as extra feature maps? Why are the orientations position dependent? Eq. (3) describes a global orientation estimate (independent of x and y). Perhaps the orientations are indeed determined at each pixel location, but then how would you define the convolution of (5); maybe rotate each kernel locally? This would make the conv layer highly non-linear and computationally very expensive. Either way, essential details are missing…\n\n\nSection 2.3.1 on page 6, “for three iterations with varying”. Perhaps you can rewrite this sentence since “iteration” typically refers to one optimization step. Perhaps you can say, we repeated each experiment 3 times with different initializations (at least if this is what is meant here, otherwise I don’t understand the sentence).\n\n\n[4. Discussion]\n\n“Though there generally is some understanding on how rotational invariance can be realized…”. This sentence undermines the work by many others in this direction. The last couple of years has seen quite some contributions to rotationally invariant and equivariant networks (see cites below). The general theory is well understood from a group theoretical point of view [1,2,3] and it has seen great success in medical imaging (see the cites in your manuscript and e.g. [4,5]) in terms of performance, network capacity/complexity and use of limited training samples. To say that there is “some understanding” is in my opinion a severe understatement.\n\n\n[references]\n[1] Cohen, Taco, Mario Geiger, and Maurice Weiler.

The suggested approach has two steps (1) train a CNN to segment glomeruli using bounding box segmentations as labels (2) predict segmentations on separate data and use these as labels for training another CNN to segment glomeruli.\nThe problem is highly relevant and I like the the idea of using the distribution of glomeruli shape and size as criteria for filtering segmentation suggestions in Stage 2.', 'cons': 'I have several issues with the submissions. Overall, I find the presentation confusing and unclear and it is possible that most of the issues arise from the lack of clarity.\nThe first paragraph of section 2.1 is a good example of what I find confusing and unclear. What characteristics are you exploiting? What is your approach very similar to? What are BBs? (Keeping track of custom abbreviations is tricky. I had to go back in the text, because I forgot what it referred to. )\n\nAnother example is Figure 5  where missing captions for the subplots makes it impossible to understand without reading the text simultaneously. Additionally, all four plots seem to have their own scaling and extent of the y-axis, making comparisons tricky.\n\nI also find it problematic that 4 out of 9 references are to your own work. Are you the only ones working on segmentation in digital pathology?\n\n\nThe main result is comparing a CNN trained on 8 images with bounding boxes (IS1) to a pair of CNNs trained on the same 8 images with bounding boxes + 9 images without bounding boxes (IS2). \nAs I understand it, Figure 5 (a) shows F-score for different combinations of number of images and number of annotations per image using images from IS1. The F-score is then calculated on five test images (IS3) with the best results being almost 0.90. You then use this result to select the number of images and number of annotations and retrain the model, but this time you get less 0.80 in F-score. Where does this difference come from?\nMore importantly, if my understanding is correct you have used performance on the test set (IS3) to select a model and then you report performance of this model on IS3. This is methodologically wrong, likely overestimates performance and invalidates your comparison.\n\nIf we ignore the above problems for a second, we are left with the conclusion that you get almost 0.90 F-score in Stage 0 where you train on IS1, and slightly lower F-score when you train on IS1 + IS2. So it seems best to just train on the bounding boxes. I think you might have used contour segmentations in Stage 0 (otherwise your conclusion does not make sense), but it is not clear to me that this is the case.\n\n\nIt is not clear what the contributions are in this submission. In the abstract you promise\n""a method for optimizing the overall trade-off between (low) annotation effort and (high) segmentation accuracy"".\nI do not believe you deliver on this promise. You do not present a method that optimizes this trade-off. You conclude that combining bounding box segmentations with unlabeled data works (almost) as well as using contour segmentations. This just shows that we can reduce annotation effort ""for free"", but does not provide a method for optimizing the trade-off.\nI also find it unclear exactly how the proposed method is different from the referenced related work. In the introduction of the methods section you state that you adapt the method from Gademayr et al (2019), and promise details in section 3. I see no mention of this in section 3 and it is not clear to me what you have done. I have a similar problem in section 2.1 where you adapt the method in Khoreva et al. (2017), but you do not clearly state what is adapted.\nIt seems to me, that the actual main contribution is the constraints applied in stage 2 (Cues 2), size and shape of glomeruli, yet these are not clearly described. \n\n\nFinally, I do not agree with your statement in the conclusion that you ""work with noisy easy-to-collect labels"". As I understand it, you derive bounding boxes from contour segmentations by fitting the smallest rectangle that contains all of the contour segmentation. This implies that you have weak labels without noise and perfect accuracy and precision (assuming your ground truth segmentations are 100%, which they most certainly are not). What you lack is detail.\nI suggest you investigate how important the quality of bounding box segmentations is, by either using segmentations from multiple annotators or by adding random shifts and scaling.', 'rating': '1: strong reject', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		SklToCZ2J4	BJxo3JPh7N	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper5/Official_Review	[]	3		['everyone']	SklToCZ2J4	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper5/AnonReviewer2']	1548672947207		1548856753817	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper5/AnonReviewer2']

163	1548576293664	"{'pros': '- The authors tackle the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in the setting of continual learning on a stream of new data and classes, and introduce several new concepts. Catastrophic forgetting in the context of this work is where a CNN is trained on some initial set of data with an associated set of classes, and then is subsequently trained on a new set of data with new classes, where without appropriate retention of instances from the first set of data, the network can begin to forget what it had learned about the initial classes. The introduced concepts to guide retention during continual learning in such scenarios would be of interest to the medical imaging community.\n\n- The authors propose the use of novel saliency quality metrics to identify which instances from the initial data set to retain for continual learning. The authors introduce Overall Saliency Quality (OSQ) to determine the quality of saliency of a given instance with respect to a class at a given training iteration, and a KL divergence for assessing pixel-level probability shifts for a given instance at a given training iteration with respect to the previous iteration. In order to identify and retain the most representative instances for given classes in data used for training on previous tasks, metrics are introduced including Average Representative Distance Selection (ARDS) as well as Distributed Exemplar Distance Selection (DEDS). These are used in a saliency-driven curriculum learning approach for exemplar instance retention, where identified instances are incorporated into the continual training of a network on new data with new classes (after training on some initial classes and data).\n\n- The proposed methods are compared with previous approaches for continual learning (iCaRL, LwF.MC, E2EL, FDR), demonstrating that it outperforms these methods on retaining validation classification accuracy on classes contained in previously trained on data when introducing new data with additional classes to a CNN classifier. ', 'cons': ""\n1) While the authors have provided plenty of detail of their proposed approach, the paper is formatted such a way that its readability is hindered, and it significantly exceeds the suggested limit of 8 pages. The manuscript is 10 pages long with references and does not have a standalone Results section. There are an additional 3 pages for an Appendix containing necessary details about the dataset and model training, as well as a larger selection of relevant figures and results. The main text does not include any space for numbered equations making it difficult to refer back to equation definitions, and it contains 2 figures which are barely legible without zooming in. The purpose of the suggested 8-page limit is to encourage concise information, relevant for the conference format. Removing material from the paper which is not directly pertinent to the message and reformatting for improved readability would greatly benefit readers.\n\n2) While the general paradigm of continual learning is of particular significance in scenarios where very large datasets with continually updating data and classes are being tackled, the vast majority of current medical imaging tasks (including those presented) are much more narrowly focused. `While the authors illustrate the improvements that their proposed method has over other continual learning methods, it would be helpful to the medical imaging community to compare results to a more standard baseline: i.e. simply a CNN trained on all available data with all classes simultaneously, without a continual learning approach. After all, retention of exemplars in the setting provided requires access to the training data used for all tasks, so the value of such a retention scheme over simply retraining the network on all data and all classes (once they became available) should be demonstrated. While it seems plausible that continual learning would have meaningful use-cases in medical imaging, it would be helpful if the authors could point to any such use-cases currently in the literature. Otherwise, demonstrating the value of continual learning on current public challenge data for example (or simply against a baseline model and training approach as described above above) would be illustrative of the proposed framework's` practical value for current applications. \n\n3) It seems that ARDS favours instances where scale and position of the salient features for a given class happen to coincide with the average saliency map. How does this affect the selection of exemplar instances for classes which have large variation in scale and position?\n\n4) Increasing data augmentation (via translation, scaling, noise addition, rotation, affine transformations, elastic deformations, etc.) is well known to improve performance of CNNs in medical imaging tasks. The authors only use a very minor rotation to augment their data. Could the authors comment on how applying richer data augmentation (listed above) would affect the retention scheme? Would exemplars be chosen from augmented images? If so, it seems this would  change the average saliency map and ARDS. Tying in with the previous point, if richer data augmentation cannot effectively be used in conjunction with the proposed retention schemes, it would again be valuable to the medical imaging community to see a performance comparison with a baseline model (as described in point (2) above) that incorporates richer data augmentation.\n\n\nMinor\n- Several minor spelling and grammatical errors throughout which should be addressed along with formatting issues. \n- Aorta repeated in list of cardiac structures.\n- figure 3 should be labelled as a table, not a figure.

', 'cons': ""Main concerns\n\n-The motivation for using self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) needs to be made clearer, and unfortunately its incorporation into the presented model makes no significant improvement over a baseline batch normalisation. The author first describes the term 'residual connections' as connections in the original V-net which forward encoder features to the decoder, which they state alleviates vanishing/exploding gradients, and which cannot be used in the presented network since no decoder is present. The authors of the V-net paper, (Milletari et al., 2016) explain that the forwarding (or 'skip') connections in V-Net are primarily there to preserve fine-grained features which would otherwise be lost during the full encoding-decoding pathway; these would also help tackle exploding/vanishing gradients. However, it seems the authors have also chosen to remove the residual units seen in the original V-net encoder (i.e. where the input of a block of filters is added to its output), which speeds up training considerably and also helps tackle exploding/vanishing gradients. There is no reason why these residual units could not be used in the encoder block of the presented CNN. The authors use the reason of not being able to use 'residual connections' to motivate the use of SNNs, to tackle vanishing/exploding gradients. Authors of the SNN paper (Klambauer et al., 2017) specify that CNNs do not suffer from exploding/vanishing gradients nearly as much as feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) (hence why the SNN paper focuses on FNNs and not CNNs). (Klambauer et al., 2017) explain that since there is weight-sharing with convolutional filters and already effective normalization approaches for CNNs (e.g. batch normalization, layer normalization, or weight normalization), SNNs are less likely to improve performance of CNNs. The motivation in Section 2.3 should accurately take into account the above factors.\n\n- The evaluation of the proposed approach would benefit from additional and more thorough experiments. The results section shows only a comparison of using a SNN framework to using batch normalization in the CNN, which they show produces no significant difference. It's hard to tell what the significance of the reported metric of RMSE is for nodule count as well, since the number of nodules typically present in a given lung lobe is not given in the first place (e.g. if mean nodule count is 1, and RMSE is 1, that does not indicate very good performance). The manuscript would benefit from additional results demonstrating if perhaps the inclusion of homoscedastic uncertainty improved performance, or whether there is a drop in performance if fewer tasks are included (e.g. only lung nodule quantification and not binary class prediction). Statistics on the labeled data (e.g. distribution of nodule counts and frequency of binary classes in the data) would also be helpful.\n\n- The evaluation is limited somewhat due to the small sample size (56 image volumes from 14 macaques). This dataset also has a lot of correlation across the 4 images per subject acquired at different stages of disease progression. Lung nodule detection also suffers from severe class imbalance, for which various strategies are typically employed but are not used or discussed in this paper.\n\nMinor comments\n- Why were ReLUs used for the output of FCNr? A more common choice for regression tasks is a linear activation on the output; was a comparison made with this? \n\n- There is inconsistency in the terms above the product symbol in Equation (5) and the summation symbol in Equation (6), where B is switched to R for the binary loss terms. This is also the case in Figure 1 in the 'Multi-task loss' box.\n\n- The acronym FCN is defined by the author as 'fully convolutional network'. However, the description in the text of Section 2.2 and Figure 1 suggests that the FCNs are actually fully connected networks, i.e. without the use of convolutional filters. This should be clarified/corrected. \n\n- There are some semantic errors throughout which could be resolved for a final version. For example, the use of the word 'sensibility', and 'exploiting gradients' should be 'exploding gradients'.\n"", 'rating': '1: strong reject', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		ryxPCJNexV	rkgO6DePQ4	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper92/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	ryxPCJNexV	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper92/AnonReviewer3']	1548318655731		1548856750042	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper92/AnonReviewer3']

While the SPIE paper [1] uses network dissection by Bau et al. showing via human annotations that activations of intermediate neurons correlate well with human-interpretable findings, the manuscript under review tries to make use of the discriminative correlating internal activations by visualizing them for the user.\n\n4) Significance\n  In the light of limited training data, having human annotators in the learning loop is a valuable direction to explore. Also, interpretable predictions hold the potential to increase confidence.\n\n5) Reproducibility\n  The basic pretrained network ResNet-152 is a public standard tool and the DDSM dataset along with the labels is available online. This makes the work reproducible in principle.\n\n[1] Wu et al., Expert identification of visual primitives used by CNNs during mammogram classification, https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04858, SPIE, 2018.', 'cons': '1) Quality\n  The difference to prior work [1] is not fully clear from the paragraph in the Introduction.\n\n2) Clarity\n  There are some typos:\n   - Intro: ""Qualitatively tell where is important in an image but fails to""\n   - Bibliography: Please check capitalization e.g. ""cnn"", ""x-rays"".\n  With some reformulations, the text can meet the (soft) limit of 8 pages.\n\n3) Originality\n  It seems that the SPIE paper [1] uses the very same experimental setup and the very same data; this could have been made a little more explicit.\n\n4) Significance\n  While having an explainable prediction, the analysis in the paper falls short in exploring the trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance.

172	1548025269545	"{'pros': 'The authors present a method for constructing LDDMM atlases by combining convolutional neural networks and LDDMM using the momentum parametrisation. Whilst previous works have shown how to combine LDDMM registration and deep neural networks (Yang et al 2017, ""Quicksilver""), to my knowledge this is the first paper to demonstrate using this method to construct an atlas. The solution presented is elegant and has nice theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of the registration as a result of using the LDDMM framework. This is therefore a very important contribution to the literature, and may be of great practical importance. Overall I think the ideas in this paper give it the potential to be amongst the most interesting at the conference.\n\nIn general the paper is very well written and clear. It has well-chosen comparisons with alternative methods that demonstrate convincingly that the proposed method achieves results that are as least as good as the conventional LDDMM method (with the important caveat highlighted below), whilst requiring just a single forward pass of the model at test time.\n\nI am also very pleased that the authors have made their code publicly available, and that they have separated this into a re-usable library and code to reproduce the specific experiments detailed in the paper.\n\nOverall I feel this is a novel and important methodological contribution but I have some serious concerns that would need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted. I think it is plausible that this could be achieved in the brief rebuttal period, and if so I would be happy to recommend this paper for acceptance.', 'cons': '\nI have two very serious concerns about this paper and a number of other suggestions for improvement. \n\nMajor Concern 1: Lack of Results Demonstrating Generalisation to Novel Images\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the discussion of the dataset, no mention is made of a held-out test set used to evaluate the model. The only numerical results in the paper are in Figure 2, which relate to the value of the objective function *during training*. I am therefore lead to conclude that the images presented in Figures 3 and 4 may well also come from the set of 25 images used for training, as there is no indication otherwise (there is a possibility that this is a misunderstanding). It is unreasonable to evaluate the performance of the model on the dataset that it was trained on, as the neural network may have overfit to the very small number of cases in the training set and the momentum fields it produces for novel may not be meaningful. The entire point of the diffeomorphic autoencoder model is that it can rapidly register novel images to the learnt atlas.  Therefore it is of utmost importance that the paper include numerical results demonstrating the performance of the model on unseen images to show that the model has not overfit, and that all figures showing registrations are clearly from images that were not used to train the model so that they reflect the expected quality of the registrations on novel images. I believe that the paper cannot be published without this, however it also seems likely that the authors should be able to rectify this issue quite quickly, especially as there is plenty of unseen data available in the OASIS dataset. For this reason I am advising ""reject"" at this point in time, however I hope that I will be able to change this in the future if satisfactory changes are made.\n\nMajor Concern 2: Insufficient Discussion Of Relationship to Previous Work and Omitted Citations\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second serious concern I have is that whilst I believe there is considerable novelty in the proposed method the authors need to take far greater care to highlight their contributions relative to existing work, including some that is not cited in the submitted manuscript.\n\nFirstly, the authors should discuss the relationship between their paper and Yang et al. 2017, (""Quicksilver..."") in greater depth. There are important similarities between that paper and the submitted manuscript that are not discussed. Yang et al also use a neural network to predict the momentum parametrisation of a geodesic shooting LDDMM method directly from the input image, but this is not sufficiently acknowledged in the literature review, where this is presented as being entirely novel. From my understanding the key differences between Yang et al. 2017 are that \n\na) Yang et al. rely on precomputed momentum estimates to supervise training of their CNN model but in the submitted manuscript they actually train their model by backpropagating through the differentiable EPDiff method and directly optimise the registration loss function\nb) The submitted manuscript also learns an atlas along with the momentum encoder whereas Yang et al. are only concerned with registering a single moving image to a single, known target image.\n\nThese are both very important contributions but I would very much like to see the differences more clearly delineated in the manuscript.\n\nFurthermore, and more importantly, the authors do not discuss the relationship to the following paper:\n\nUnsupervised Learning for Fast Probabilistic Diffeomorphic Registration\nAdrian V. Dalca, Guha Balakrishnan, John Guttag, and Mert R. Sabuncu\nMICCAI 2018, pages 729-738\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-00928-1_82\nor\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04605.pdf\n\nThis work is very close to the current paper in that both use neural networks to speed up diffeomorphic registration, though Dalca et al.  do not include atlas learning as part of their framework. Furthermore there appear to be differences in the way that the two papers parametrise the diffeomorphic deformation and implement the solution of the resulting differential equation but unfortunately my knowledge of the underlying mathematics here is not sufficient to comment on this with authority in limited time. What is clear however is that the current paper needs to discuss its relationship to Dalca et al. in some technical detail.\n\nAssorted Minor Comments and Suggestions:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow on to some other suggestions that would improve the paper but should not prevent acceptance.\n\nTo start with, a very easy fix - the Figure references have somehow become mixed up. The text frequently refers to Figure 3.2 and 3.3 but there are no such figures!\n\nIn my opinion there is room for improvement in the schematic diagram in Figure 1. It would be clearer if the encoder network were explicitly drawn and the process by which the atlas is involved in the learning process made clearer. It is important that this figure is clear to give readers the best chance of understanding the novel and complex method quickly.\n\nAnother concern is that the authors used only a very very small subset of the available OASIS dataset -- 25 out of nearly 2000 volumes -- to construct their atlas, but no justification for this is offered. It seems like their proposed method should be trivially scalable to any number of volumes, so why not use them? It occurs to me that this may be because the authors wanted a fair comparison with the standard LDDMM technique, and it would take a long time to use the standard LDDMM method on nearly 2000 images. This would be a good justification but the authors should state it explicitly.\n\nThe authors claim that they ""did not observe need for [...] heuristics such as batch normalization"" (section 3.2, first paragraph). However using batch normalisation (or occasionally other sorts of normalisation) has become a de facto standard in neural networks because it is consistently observed to speed up training considerably and also improve generalisation performance. I would suggest the authors try using batch norm in future experiments, unless they are using very small batch sizes.\n\nThe authors claim that one potential reason that the proposed neural network method may reach a lower value of the loss function on the training data than the standard LDDMM method is that mini-batch updates can be used in the optimisation process (section 3.2, second parapgraph). It is difficult to assess this however, as the authors do not state what size of minibatch they used in their experiments.\n\nThe primary justification for using the Diffeomorphic Autoencoder to predict the momentum initialisation for EPDiff is that it should be considerably faster than having to perform an iterative optimisation method to register a new image to the atlas. This is alluded to in section 2.2, but there are no results that actually investigate this. The paper would be far more compelling if results were given for how much faster a novel image can be registered to the atlas using the diffeomorphic auto-encoder versus using the standard auto-encoder. To be clear: I expect that their method is much faster, it has just not been demonstrated. Without this, the authors have not really demonstrated that their method has any advantage over the standard method.\n\nIn the explanation of the momentum encoder model, it is quite unclear how the 64D latent code is transformed into the momentum vector field. The paper simply states the latent code is ""followed by the output vector field of the network of size 3 × 83 × 118 × 110"". More detail is needed here. Are there some upsampling or transposed convolutional layers here or just a fully connected layer followed by a reshaping? I briefly looked at the source code but was not immediately able to figure it out. The reader should be able to understand this without looking at the source code.\n\nThis leads me to a comment on the encoder model. It seems to me that the purpose of including the bottleneck (the 64D layer) in the model is dubious. On the one hand, it allows you do some nice interpolations in the latent space as shown in Figure 4, but is this really practically very useful? Maybe it is if you are looking to do certain types of shape modelling, but this is only briefly alluded to in the conclusion and not in much detail. It also provides a degree of regularisation, but it\'s not clear that this is necessary. On the other hand, it will likely reduce the ability of the model to match fine details of the two images. Why not instead use a U-Net-like model (or any image-to-image model without a bottleneck) to output the momentum vector field directly? This would enable the network to consider both global and local information in the input image when creating the momentum image, and would therefore probably be more able to match fine details and give a better registration. Dalca et al (see above) use this approach. The paper would benefit from some justification of the authors\' choice here, and the authors may like to consider this carefully in future work.\n', 'rating': '2: reject', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		Hkg0j9sA1V	SyxA2TOzXN	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper19/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	Hkg0j9sA1V	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper19/AnonReviewer1']	1548025269545		1548856748453	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper19/AnonReviewer1']

In section 3.4, they talk about instance segmentation which means they are interested in being able to segment each of the cells present in the image (i.e. each cell has one label as opposed to having only two labels: a label for the cells and another for the background). However, in section 2 they refer to the segmentation task of separating cells from background which is not instance segmentation. This raises a couple of questions:\n1) Which task are you aiming at in the end?\n2) If the goal is to do instance segmentation, you need to better explain how the circular approximations are obtained from the ground truth. Figure 1a displays the ground truth and the cells are not individually identified. They are grouped under a single label. How do you extract the different cells?\n3) If the goal was to do a semantic segmentation, why there was a need to modify the U-Net described in point 3.4?\n\n- Quality of the experimental setup: I consider that the main weakness of this experiment is the way in which the "" weak annotations"" are obtained. These come from a perturbation done to the ground truth through a circular approximation followed by noise adding (some further steps are done for the U-Net). How realistic is to represent weak annotations through an alteration of the ground truth? Is it possible to derive conclusions on how these methods would improve some hypothetical  weak annotations provided by a user based on these experiments? I think your idea is interesting but you should either: 1) define an experimental setup where the weak annotations are closer to what a user would provide or 2) provide a reasonable justification of your current choice.\n** As previously stated, your idea is interesting. However, is it feasible to think that one would use two chained U-Net architectures to cope for weak annotations. I find this to be an unrealistic scenario.\nMoreover, you should consider that the training set of the first network consists of an already good guess of the real data. How would this work when the quality of the training data is poor at first instance?\n** A previous work from Rajchl et al (arXiv 2017), explores the effect of weak annotations on medical image segmentation. The  authors could consider a similar setup to define initial weak annotations and then use those in combination with simple methods (not deep learning, see for example the section Merging pre-segmentations from Rajchl et al) that refine the weak annotations and lead to a better final result. \n\n- Significance: The authors do not compare to other works addressing weak annotations missing to demonstrate the significance of their work. They should compare their work to recent works showing good segmentation results directly from weak annotations such as those cited in the introduction or the work of Wang et al, MedIA 2016. \nIt would be interesting to see if by using simple methods, as the ones they evaluate, it is possible to achieve higher performance that when using more complex methods.', 'rating': '2: reject', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature'}"		BklpVE1eg4	Hklhx0ii7V	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper49/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	BklpVE1eg4	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper49/AnonReviewer1']	1548627444066		1548856746545	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper49/AnonReviewer1']

By positioning this work w.r.t with these previous one, it is easier to understand the value of the current work.\n\n-  Clarity: The paper is not always easy to read. First because there are many steps involving different algorithms (i.e the U-Net, a Random Forest and finally a Boosted Tree). For this I would recommend adding a diagram where one can see how the different steps of the framework are interconnected, which algorithms are used and which data is used (sample sizes) for each of them. \nSecond, there are several there some mistakes and missing elements in the methodology which are not properly introduced.

What is it that you aim for? Moreover, when reporting results on table 2 it is never mentioned which structure was being segmented.\n** In Section 2.2 the author refers to a "" previously trained"" CNN model to separate the slices to remove from those to keep"". More details should be provided 1) on the CNN model (as no further information is given) and 2) on the separation of slices as the problem is never formally introduced and one has to infer what the author aims at from the text.\n** Before equation 1, the author refers to a "" corresponding mask"". This is never introduced.\n** In Equation 1, refer to the pixel as x_{i}. It is confusing to call it pix_{i} as the i acts also as the index.\n** The slice number as a feature seems, as it is right now, a strange choice. The author should provide more details: \n      1) What numbers are assigned to slices that do not contain the heart? \n      2) Perhaps these are excluded at training but, then how does it work at testing? Is it needed to only provide slices containing the heart? How do you achieve this?\n      3) Is the image resolution taken into account for the normalisation? Please provide details. \n** As previously mentioned, the author selected to use three different algorithms. The first is the modified U-Net that was previously proposed for the segmentation, second there is a random forest for classifying keep vs. remove slices and finally a boosting tree to predict the dice score. Could you please discuss the reason why you chose to use something at each step?\n** It is not clear how detecting the erroneously segmented slices improves segmentation accuracy (Table 1). Do you remove those identified and then measure again? This should be better explained.\n** Provide details on implementation of U-Net and Boosting tree as done with the random forest.\nI consider that the author has sufficient space to provide further details about the methodology. Moreover, the section on the MRI sequences (1.1) seems too long for this type of paper. I would recommend to leave only section 3.1 (which seems slightly redundant at the moment) with may be a couple of more details to introduce the data. \n\n- Methodology & Evaluation:\n** Robinson et al MICCAI 2018 discussed the problem of highly imbalanced data for the accuracy prediction with the dice score as most of the dice scores were concentrated in a small range. How did you address this problem? It would be interesting to see reported the range of dice scores used for training.\n** The dataset used for evaluation is rather small consisting of only 40 cases. As the method contains several steps, it would be interesting to see how the data is distributed among all of the training/testing tasks that are required.\n** Why the validation strategy is different (5 fold vs 10 fold CV) when evaluating the classifier and the regressor? Is this related to the data limitations? Please clarify.\n\n- Results: \n** It is strange not to see some visual example of the results that are expected from this work. One would expect to see examples of slices kept/removed along with the ground truth. Similarly, one would expect to see segmented slices along with predicted dice score, uncertainty measure and real ground truth.\n** From Figure 2, one could say that there is no need to use a classifier to keep or remove slices. One could argue that by defining a threshold around 0.995 it would be possible to obtain a good classification of keep vs. remove slices. Could you please comment on this?\n** Figure 3 shows that the uncertainty measure you propose is always very high (> 0.992 in the worst case). This means that your measure is always very confident about the segmented pixels. However, the dice scores either:\n   1) Run over a large range of values. For example, for an uncertainty higher than 0.994 the measured dice score is slightly higher than 0.2 (first plot). There are several cases presenting a similar score  or,\n   2) For a same (high) uncertainty value present different dice scores that run over a rather large range of values. This can be seen from the ""columns"" of predicted and measured uncertainty-dice value pais piled along the same abscissa value. \n\nFrom this behaviour, one could conclude that the proposed uncertainty measure might not have a significant contribution to the regression model, as the author states.

CNN-based shape modeling and latent space discovery and was realized for heart ventricle shapes with an auto-encoder, and integrated into Anatomically Constrained Neural Networks (ACNNs) [1]. Their voxel resolution is only sligthly smaller than in this work (120x120x40), with a similar latent dimensionality (64D, here: 3*29=87). Smooth shape interpolation by traversal of the latent space was also demonstrated, and some of their latents also corresponded to reasonable variations in anatomical shape, without being ""restricted"" to statistical modes of variation as discussed here. \n- Compared to the proposed work, where latents represent clinically relevant mandible landmarks, an auto-encoder approach as in ACNN is more general: relevant landmarks as in the mandible cannot be identified for arbitrary anatomies, and a separate training of decoder and decoder as proposed here crucially depends on a semantically meaningful latent space with a supervised mapping to the dense representation (e.g. hand-labeled landmarks vs. voxel labelmaps). In contrast, ACNN auto-encoders train their encoder and decoder in conjunction. How do authors suggest to apply their approach to anatomies where it is impossible (in terms of feasibility and manual effort) to place a sufficiently large number of unique landmarks on the anatomy (e.g. smooth shapes, such as left ventricle in ACNN)?\n- Authors suggest that their solution ""is not constrained by statistical modes of variation"", as e.g. by PCA-based SSM methods. While I agree that the linear latent space assumption of PCA is too simplistic and the global effect of PCA latents on the whole shape often undesirable, the ordering of latents according to ""percent of variance explained"" is actually desirable in terms of interpretability. \n\n[1] Oktay O, Ferrante E, Kamnitsas K, Heinrich M, Bai W, Caballero J, et al.

Methods, materials and validation are of a sufficient quality. There are certain original aspects in this work (hourglass-networks with skip connections, once direct and once with additional convolution operations), but overall, the novelty is limited. The evaluation is performed on the publicly available JHU-ISI JIGSAWS dataset, for which competitive methods and results are available.  \n\nPros:\n- Good overview of related literature on action segmentation from kinematic data\n- Validation on JIGSAWS data is well comparable to other methods in literature.\n- Comparison of several hourglass architectures and kinematics representations in the experiments. ', 'cons': '\nRemaining questions / clarity:\n- While HMMs and RNN/LSTMs are designed to handle temporal sequences of varying length T, a FCNN architecture as proposed here requires a fixed-length input. Authors try different lengths in this work (10/20/.../50), but it is not clear 1) what the unit of this temporal window length is (10 seconds, or 10 samples of 76D kinematic vectors), 2) if 10 means ""10 samples"", at what framerate were  kinematics recorded, and how many seconds of kinematic data are covered by 10/20/.../50 samples?, 3) whether the inference was performed in a sliding window fashion with striding, and what the striding factor was (dense sliding, or every n samples, or windows with 50% overlap)? \n- The comparison evaluation to other methods (Table 3) does not feature results for ED-TCN, but authors could include this with little effort, by removing the encoder-to-decoder skip connections from the ED-TCN-Link network and re-training.\n\nCons:\n- The ED-TCN-Link network architecture is an hourglass network with skip connections from the down-sampling to the up-sampling layers. This idea is not novel though, and the resulting architecture is in principle identical to a 1D U-Net with summation instead of concatenation of feature maps in the up-sampling path [1]. Could the authors please discuss this similarity and explain whether and in which way their architecture is different from a 1D U-Net?\n- Three different kinematics representations were tested (All/Slave/PVG), as originally proposed by Lea et al. Results confirm the previous finding by Lea et al. that PVG performs better than the other two representations, but no further insight beyond this is won from this experiment. For example, in future work, it could be more interesting to investigate whether more efficient latent representations of ""All"" can be achieved. One interesting direction could be e.g. deep bayesian state space models [2]. \n- The ED-TCN-ConvLink architecture is similar to ED-TCN-Link, but with convolutional and pooling layers put into the forward links. In the experiments, this architecture almost consistently performs worse than ED-TCN-Link. I can imagine that this is due to the incorporation of pooling (downsampling), and I would recommend trying to leave them out and perform only convolution instead (the link needs to be summed into one higher layer in the up-sampling path though, right after the up-sampling layer, to match resolution). In U-Net and comparable architectures, horizontal links preserve spatial resolution and high-frequency features from the down-sampling path. Maybe the loss in accuracy is due to this loss in resolution.\n\n[1] Ronneberger O, Fischer P, Brox T. U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.

The main contribution is a modified training strategy which optimizes the prediction of tissue classes separately with sigmoids, instead employing a traditional softmax function.

Moreover, the strategy of processing 3D images in separate patches (both in training and testing) is actually implemented in several segmentation methods, for instance DeepMedic and HyperDenseNet. In fact, this random region crop strategy is fairly standard when training deep segmentation networks from large images.     \n\n- The proposed method seems to be tailored to this specific dataset (iSeg), i.e., three classes, two of them having a large overlap. A stronger validation could have been achieved by testing the proposed method on other brain MRI segmentation datasets (e.g., MRBrains), or problems where class imbalance is more pronounced (e.g., brain legion segmentation).      \n\nMinor comments:\n\n- The proposed architecture merges modalities in the first layer, however recent studies have shown that later fusion could lead to better performance (e.g., Dolz et al., 2018). Perhaps authors could motivate this architecture choice.    \n\n- ""calculating sigmoid is less computationally cumbersome for a processing unit compared to softmax especially for large number of labels."": I doubt this makes a real difference in computation time.\n\n- ""... our 3D FC-DenseNet architecture which is deeper than previous DenseNets with more skip-layer connections and less number of parameters"": This is a bit misleading.

The selected dataset, as well as all pre-processing steps, is correctly described.\nResults show that the collaborative learning approach seem to yield more true positives and fewer false positives and negatives.', 'cons': 'Here are my main concerns about the paper:\n\n* The experimental results, which basically consist of Table 1, are quite brief and not particularly convincing.\nMore statistics on the distribution of the statistics (mix/max/quartile/etc.) would have been helpful. Only reporting the mean and standard deviation is not sufficient, especially when they are so close to each other.  With such results, running statistical tests seems an absolute requirement to me, in order to understand whether any difference is statistically significant or not.\nRegarding the statistics on TP/FP/FN, it would also have been useful to include the actual number of lesions in the average dataset (otherwise it is difficult to assess how useful is this +3.15 TP).\n\n* It is also surprising that the proposed methods have better true positive and lower false positives/negatives, despite having a lower average of Dice coefficient. I think this should have been discussed by the authors.\n\n* The authors refer to a number of related literature throughout the paper but didn\'t compare their approach to any of them.\n\n* All experiments have been run on 2D slices, while state of the art methods for segmentation typically use 3D networks. \nFurthermore, it is not clear how the final results have been recombined, and whether the statistics on the number of lesions have been computed in 2D or 3D.\n\n* Another major problem of the paper is the writing of the method description.\nFigure 2 should probably be either refined or split into two smaller ones to make the difference between the two approaches more apparent.\nSection 3.1 is overly complex, with notations that are not useful (introducing a genetic \\phi while it is merely a downsampling operation) or only defined two sections later (e.g the ""temperature"" \\tau).\nI also find the distillation part a bit confusing, for instance in (4) I don\'t understand why tau is 1 in the first term but T in the other ones.\nIn general, the link between the equations and what the authors want to model needs to be more explicit.\n\n* The conclusion is also a bit confusing: \n- The authors admit that the ""type of problem chosen"" was inadequate.\n- The distillation approach did not seem to perform any better than a standard U-Net, but the authors wrote that they did not optimize some hyperparameters (why ?).\n\n* There are a number of typos and arguable statements, for instance:\n- Page 2 ""typically low-resolution scans are annotated"". \nI don\'t see why this would be the case - this seems like a counterintuitive approach. I don\'t know which tools were used to label the images but I don\'t think using a higher resolution image would increase the labeling time that much.\n- Typo on page 2 ""to the a common coordinate system""\n- Page 3 the sentence ""Shared representations [...] follows the network illustrated in Figure 2"" is a bit confusing with the two references to Figure 2.\n- Page 3 ""Usually in medical imaging, there are complimentary inputs with targets defined on one of the inputs"".

In particular, they divide the diagnosis into 25 different tasks, including the number of nodules in each lobe, and the presence of up to 4 types of manifestations in each region. They use a multi-task approach, combining classification and regressions models with a dedicated multilayer perceptron for each task, and defining a combined loss function weighted by the task homoscedastic uncertainty. Additionally, the authors include self-normalizing blocks by using scaled exponential linear units as activation functions. Despite the limited database used in the experiments (a total of 14 cases and 56 volumes), the proposed model seems to present better properties than alternative and more conventional approaches using batch normalization, in terms of convergence. The use of clinical reports as ground-truth is an interesting approach. However, further validation needs to be done. \n\nPros:\n- The use of clinical reports as ground truth is interesting, as alternative to the more traditional and  time-consuming manual segmentations.\n\n- The proposed network seems to present good convergence properties, thanks to the use of self-normalizing blocks.\n\n- The paper is well structured and it is easy to follow.

In this context, it is hard to properly evaluate the performance of the models presented.\nSee more comments below:\n- I would recommend the authors to review the way the manuscript is written. There are some expressions that doesn’t sound quite right to me. For example: “[…] this approach is unfeasible. As it is extremely time consuming, subjective and prone to errors. “ —> I don’t think the use of two separate sentences is grammatically correct.

I think the second part should be “x <= 0”, not “x <= 1”.\n- How can it be a 5-folds CV if each fold corresponds to one single case, and there are 14 patients? Each fold should contain 3 cases, with one of the folds containing only 2.

How did the authors tried to optimize the hyper-parameters to deal with this? Is there any significant difference between cases that could be responsible of this behaviour.\n- Please, adjust the scale of all the figures in Fig.2. It is difficult to compare different graphs if the y-axis has a different scale-range on each one.\n- Also, from Figure 2 it is clear that 10K iterations wasn’t enough to converge. I would strongly suggest the authors to repeat the experiments since the reported results might be sub-optimal.\n- I would suggest to provide a separate evaluation of recall and precision, instead of the combined F1. Also, \n- How is it possible that in those folds where the BN+PReLU model is clearly diverging (e.g., fold 1 or 4), it is obtained a similar performance to the SELU model? Moreover, in Table 2 it can be seen that RMSE value for fold 1 is lower than fold 2, where the BN+PReLU was showing better convergence.\n- In the conclusion, the authors claim that the proposed model presents a lower computational complexity.

The clinical value of CM images has been highlighted in previous work, but although effective towards the goal of detecting the presence of cancer, these images are hard to interpret by humans.

I understand that the available space is limited and therefore it\'s difficult to bring in the paper all the information that would be necessary, but the introduction should be extended to include previous work both in terms of DL and medical research. \n\nThis paper still represent a niche application of a more general DL technique that has been already used for a large number of similar applications. The contribution is therefore incremental, building on top of well-known techniques. \n\nAfter the publication at MICCAI 2019 of the work ""Distribution Matching Losses Can Hallucinate Features in Medical Image Translation"" and similar other works, it has started becoming apparent that the simple visual similarity between samples generated by a GAN and true samples from a specific distribution doesn\'t ensure that diagnostic value is kept. \n\nThis doesn\'t mean that cycle-GAN type of techniques are not suited for medical imaging since they might wipe out their diagnostic value, but it means that every study around this topic needs to prove that the diagnostic value is indeed kept! Unfortunately the authors didn\'t report indications in this sense in their paper. \n\nThe main contribution of the paper is scarcely justified by the statement ""...they confirmed that the images were similar to those in routine"". I feel it would have been extremely interesting to evaluate the performance of those same clinicians (and others) diagnosing cancer using both H&E stained image and CM images of the same patient (or patient distributions) vs a control group. A lengthy study, I agree, but a necessity in light of other recent works highlighting how dangerous is to use GANs for this kind of tasks. \n\nThe choice de-speckle network architecture is somewhat not sound, with the multiplicative residual connection near the outputs of the network and the median filtering operation. Is there some reference for multiplicative residual connections? How do we know that the network is learning 1/F (inverse of speckle noise)? Can we prove that at least visually? Is the math right? \n\nIt is necessary to prove that the generated images retain their important diagnostic value.

(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2009.12.003), work by Bekkers et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-013-0488-6).

218	1548537201084	"{'pros': 'Overall, the idea is clearly presented. The problem of irregularity detection by unsupervised methods is highly relevant. If one could come up with a method that does not require any annotation, but solely extracts normal healthy tissue (patches) from a database of e.g. mammographic images, thus allowing to discriminate normal image patches from benign/malignant ones through the distance to a generative model of the normal ones, such a method would have a huge impact (in case it works at high discrimination accuracy). \nIt is potentially possible that the proposed method could work if trained on a one to two orders of magnitude larger dataset of healthy tissue image patches, but this is hard to achieve and not discussed in the present work. ', 'cons': 'I have a number of concerns regarding this work:\n\n- Most importantly, I think the proposed GAN is not able to distinguish normal from benign or malignant (i.e. potentially cancerous) tissue, as the authors propose. While the definition of an anomaly from the clinical point of view demands that the respective image patch contains benign or malignant tissue, what the authors define as an anomaly (according to Figure 1) is those patches, that the autoencoder R is not able to reconstruct appropriately. I would argue, that the latter distribution of image patches is a lot larger than the distribution of image patches containing benign or malignant structures (a confirmation for this proposition can be found in Figure 4). Essentially, the authors intend to teach the discriminator what are cancerous image patches, but during training they solely provide image patches labelled as fake for the discriminator, which have a large reconstruction error. In my opinion, the discriminator can only learn to distinguish normal patches, from patches that R cannot reconstruct. Although these may be called irregularities, this is not the same as cancerous tissues (as the title and all the motivation presumes). \n\n- From the description and experiments, I do not find any hints if the authors have actually explored the empirical distribution of normal healthy tissue image patches, which they learned during the training of R. Since the generative model of healthy tissue is the crucial component for the irregularity detection score, I would expect that this learned distribution is deeply investigated, e.g. by randomly modifying the embedding values generated in the bottleneck layer of R, or by interpolating between the embeddings of different image patches. GANs need huge amounts of training data, while the datasets used in here come from a subset of 322 images of the MIAS database, which is very limited in terms of size. I do not expect that from such a small number of images, the sought for distribution can be learned with GANs.\n\n- Going one step further on the problem of limited training data for learning the generative model, the recent literature has given a lot of reason to criticize GANs of actually not really providing a meaningful distribution. See e.g. Arora et al., ICLR 2017 and Arora et al., ICLR 2018, but also other recent works at NIPS 2018 have shown theoretical doubts about the use of GANs for modelling image distributions or assessing out of distribution samples, even in the case of large datasets. The mode collapse problem, which is especially problematic for the traditional GAN formulation, is an indication for that. However, the authors do not discuss these doubts at all, or how they probably may be overcome in their proposed work due to the autoencoder step. Additionally, according to our own experiments in our group, the use of more recent Wasserstein GANs has proven much more stable in terms of generated distributions and the mode collapse problem, compared with the traditional GAN formulation. So it is not clear, why the authors pursue the traditional GAN formulation, which is not considered as state-of-the-art anymore.\n\n- I think the experimental evaluation, despite going into the effort of comparing with other methods, does not give convincing results regarding the performance of the method. First, the results in Table 1 on the MIAS dataset are clinically questionable. While the fully supervised methods give a reasonable performance in terms of AUC and F1-score (up to 0.91 AUC), all the unsupervised methods perform pretty poorly on the task at hand. From the practical point of view, I would not consider an AUC of 0.76 or F1 of 0.71 as a performance that is good enough to be used clinically, even if there is a lot less annotation effort involved with the method. So although the proposed approach is slightly better than the compared unsupervised ones, the absolute performance of all unsupervised methods is clinically not relevant. Given these results, I would invest in improving the supervised methods further, on the same annotated data, and forget about the unsupervised ones. Furthermore, the results shown in Table 2 are also far from acceptable, both for the supervised and unsupervised variant, since with an AUC (or 1-AUC) close to 0.5, these results for binary classification are essentially the same as by random guessing. \n\n- My criticism regarding methodology and evaluation results are also confirmed in Figure 4. From the heat maps, it is not clear what the thresholds are to perform detection of irregular structures. There seem to be a lot of false positive regions in very clearly healthy tissue regions, which makes the method\'s performance questionable (note that this problem is in line with quantitative results mentioned above). It seems that the generative model is actually not picking up the distribution of healthy tissue as it is supposed to do. Another issue regarding Figure 4 is the question, why the authors did not compute a  quantitative evaluation in terms of AUC/F1 against the ground truth segmentation (see third row of Fig. 4) available for this data?  \n\nOverall, I do not agree with the statement in the discussion that the proposed method obtains ""acceptable results"" despite being unsupervised. I think the supervised state-of-the-art methods (I am certain there are tailored supervised methods that perform even better than plain AlexNet or VGG-Net on MIAS or CBIS-DDSM - these should also be mentioned), deliver far better results than the unsupervised ones shown here. If this performance drop is the price to pay for getting no annotation effort, I think a clinician will not be willing to pay it. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n- the manuscript is not easy to read, since there are quite a number of grammar mistakes and typos still contained in it\n- I would not agree that it is relevant to say in the discussion that ""accuracy scores of all unsupervised methods are significantly better than chance (i.e. p-value <0.01 in Fisher\'s exact test (Fisher, 1935))"", since presumably the p-value is low due to the large N, and of course it is the distance to the chance classifier that is relevant in the end. regarding statistical significance, it would be more interesting to ask if there are significant differences between the performances of the different unsupervised methods in Table 1\n- in the introduction, the authors claim two contributions (1) and (2), which in my opinion are very similar\n- in 2.4 the authors state that their R+M training is similar to GANs from Goodfellow et al., 2014.

The paper is well structured and easy to follow. Up to my knowledge, the specific idea of using reinforcement learning to track elongated structures given a seed point is original, and the authors propose an implementation using a state-of-the-art RL technique utilizing deep CNNs for the path predictions of the actor and the prediction of the expected risk in the value function. As such it follows recent successful ideas proposed by Mnih et al., 2015 (please note that reference Mnih et al misses the publication year), and adapts them to the tracking task. \n\nA strength of this work is that by using RL, the authors are able to train their tracking algorithm from an entirely synthetic dataset, and show that this trained agent is in principle able to solve the tracking task on their real-word two-photon microscopy image segmentation/tracking task, which depicts the axons of a mouse somatosensory cortex. Another strength of this work is the clear description of their algorithm (pseudocode), which makes it very likely for others to reproduce their results, as well as the fact that the authors promise to release their training data and code to the public in case of manuscript acceptance. ', 'cons': 'In my opinion, there are a number of stronger issues, mainly regarding the experimental evaluation, that diminish the scientific value of this work:\n\n- While the overall idea of the manuscript looks interesting, the evaluation is very much limited regarding choice of dataset and general applicability of the proposed original concept. The introduction is written in a spirit that claims the proposed method being able to (quote) ""alleviate the need for hand-engineered trackers for different biomedical image datasets"". This is not shown in the experiments, since a single real-world dataset containing thin, elongated structures is used, after training from a synthetic dataset that looks very similar to what kind of information is expected to be visible in the real-world dataset. To evaluate the claim, that the proposed method is generic, and kind of a meta strategy for learning how to track thin, elongated structures, performance on different, additional datasets would need to be shown. As it is presented in the manuscript, unfortunately only a very limited experimental evaluation is given, from which I do not get the impression that a novel concept has been developed, but solely that a very specific problem has been solved with a method, which may be overly complex for the task at hand.\n\n- Reinforcement learning has been used for medical image analysis tasks, e.g. the work of Ghesu et al., PAMI 2017 and Ghesu et al., MIA 2018, where actually the goal of localizing landmarks by letting an agent follow appearance information in volumetric CT data until a multitude of different landmark locations is reached, reminds me a lot of the work proposed in this manuscript. While I see room for further exploration of these RL based concepts in medical image analysis literature, it is necessary to mention these approaches in the related work section and to discuss commonalities and differences. \n\n- In the introduction, the authors argue about tracking vs. segmentation to justify their tracking approach formulated in the RL framework. I do not fully agree with their arguments. I think by solving the segmentation problem robustly, tracking starting from a seed point - thus deriving e.g. structural information on the geometry of relevant data - would be trivial. Therefore, I think the authors miss the comparison with pure segmentation strategies for solving the task that they show in their evaluation. In the recent years, there was a lot of work in enhancement of vascular structures using deep learning based methods, both in 2D (optical retinopathy) as well as 3D. For example DRIU (MICCAI 2016), but also other works following up on that have provided state-of-the-art benchmarks for segmentation, which are able to overcome missing structures. This body of work is totally ignored by the authors. I would not consider the Vaa3D algorithm as a fair, state-of-the-art comparison to show the benefits of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method is not able to outperform the Vaa3D method on this dataset, so the question has to be asked, what are the practical implications of the propsed method? (As stated above, there are no other use cases demonstrated, to show more generic applicability.)\n\n- The authors argue about subpixel accuracy, however, this is misleading. In my opinion, using the continuous outputs of the predicted actor displacement locations, which are modelled by continous distributions, they solely are able to operate in a subpixel environment. However, from their experimental evaluation, where coverage is defined in a three pixel radius and mean errors are slightly below 2 pixels for their method, and most importantly, the segmentation ground truth is defined on the pixel grid, I would not consider the outcome of their algorithm as having subpixel accuracy. \n\n- Another criticism of the evaluation is the fact that the authors state that they can finetune their method on ""a very small amount of labelled data"" to improve their performance, compared with solely training from synthetic data. However, in their experiment they fine-tune on three quarters (15 out of 20) of the available labelled datasets. Therefore, I would consider this conclusion as incorrect.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n- I think repeating the six numerical values in Table 1 is redundant, since those are already stated in the text.\n- From the results of the methods and their discussion in the paper, it is not clear what a relevant error would be for the downstream tasks regarding the two-photon microscopy image dataset. Is Vaa3D already there, or is a higher accuracy still needed?\n- In Fig. 1 and its explaining texts, it is not clear what are the start and manually labelled end points of the trackers, and what the different colors in the middle subfigure mean. \n- In 3.1, I do not fully understand the details of the - very important - reward function, giving the negative of the base reward if an action means there is a 90 degree or greater change seems to be a heuristic, please explain that in more detail.', 'rating': '2: reject', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		HJxrNvv0JN	H1eomCX57E	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper13/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	HJxrNvv0JN	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper13/AnonReviewer2']	1548529187354		1548856736001	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper13/AnonReviewer2']

The basic assumption to perform segmentation using the difference map between the input image and the auto-encoder (AE) reconstruction is that the difference is only attributed to lesions. I am not quite sure whether this assumption always holds. For example, if the AE is able to reconstruct brain images with lesions as well, then the segmentations of the unlabelled images would not be available. In addition, if the difference is not caused by lesions, but instead by other structural abnormalities, then the lesion segmentations would be wrong.\n\n2. In the introduction, the paper mentions that one major challenge in lesion segmentation is the wide variety of lesion appearances. Maybe it would be helpful to show that the AE segmentation method can cope with different lesion patterns.\n\n3. Two thresholds or operation points (OPs) are used for segmentation.

Interpretability is indeed a still existing problem, and the idea of utilizing the shift in the saliency maps [15] is highly appreciated and considered as original.\n- The motivation behind the proposed methods is very clearly put and rationalized.\n', 'cons': '- Experiment set up is either flawed or not well written in my opinion.\n- Results do not focus sufficiently on the novelties proposed in this manuscript.\n- Figures should be improved and extended.\n\nBelow, questions and comments are formulated in more depth:\n\nPlease elaborate on the major differences with your other submission “Continual few-shot learning for medical image analysis”, which is similarly motivated and also evaluated on the same dataset.\n\nThe main contribution of this work is to exploit saliency maps [15] for both interpretations of ""forgetting"" and exemplar sample selection during class-incremental training, which is very interesting. Unfortunately, the only time the reader gets a glimpse of falling quality in the saliency maps is in the Appendix for a vanilla finetuning approach. It would be of great value if the authors dedicate a full page (if not more) showing how the saliency map for a group of representative images change for the compared methods across incremental tasks (ideally with the corresponding KLD scores of the instances). In addition, the authors should consider showing a few images with high and low OSQ, since this metric lies in the foundation of the methodology.\n\nOne of my major concern is on the experiment setup. If the dataset is split by 80:20 (as stated in the Appendix), does this imply that during a new task schedule, same images/instances are being trained on, only with different ground truth annotations (of the actively trained 3 classes)? -If not: \nPlease clarify either that the instances of 4C, LVOT, and 3V are mutually exclusive sets, or how the training set was split during the successive incremental tasks. \n-If it is; then the results raise a lot of questions. \nIf at the end of a stage of a task, the network manages to perfectly fit the ground truth, then the stored logits will essentially be the same as the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, this would also raise questions for the motivation, where it is stated that the labels for old tasks are no longer available.\n\nAnother major concern is of how the exemplar samples are chosen. In Page 6, authors say ""After each task schedule we generate class activation maps using [9] for the validation data per class [...]"", and use these class activation maps when picking the exemplar samples for that stage. Unfortunately, it looks like the same validation set was used to compute model accuracy in the successive stages (cf. Fig 3). For a proper experiment, the model accuracy should be evaluated on data which was never seen, however, exemplar samples were picked based on information from the data which is later used for evaluations. In addition, unless the authors used the validation set samples to compute the “class means” for the baselines, compared methods such as iCaRL have an unfair disadvantage.\n\nIntroduction:\nI feel an abrupt change in the flow of text in the first paragraph; ""[...] been proposed for fetal sonography [1,2].  As with other applications of deep networks in medical image analysis and traditional computer vision [...]"" Perhaps the authors can smooth the transition with an additional sentence.\n\nLiterature Review:\nWhile it is understandable that authors reference the fundamental literature or surveys on literature review, authors say ""In medical imaging, incremental addition of new data has largely been unaddressed despite clinical systems often acquiring data in non-deterministic phases."" Then, they proceed with examples of shifted topics such as transfer learning or multitask learning from the medical domain.\nIt seems that the authors have missed referencing the recent work https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00937-3_42 on MR segmentation in a class-incremental setting, which is tackling a similar problem, the difference being segmentation as opposed to object detection.\nFurthermore, it seems to me that the exemplar selection methods proposed on Page 6 as well as objective function on Page 7 have similarities with this earlier work; i.e. exemplars are picked in a way to keep class samples with high confidence while also maximizing coverage of sub-clusters of class latent space representations.\n\nImplementation Details:\nIt is not clear how the classification network produces a bounding box for object detection in terms of bounding boxes. It seems that sufficiently small patches were generated and classified with the CNN, but this information is either missing from the manuscript or not emphasized enough such that I missed it.\n\nFig 1:\nConsider replacing with vector graphics. Figure barely readable even on digital environment.\n\nMethods:\nAlthough I believe ""stage of task"" and ""task schedule"" refers to training on a new set of classes (i.e., the first stage on 4C view classes and second stage on LVOT structures, so on), it would be better if defined formally in the text.\n\nExperiment Setup:\nOn Page 5, authors state the image inputs are 224x224, and map quality is estimated as a cumulative metric over 16x16 grids. However, later in Appendix, it is written that the instances are 100x100 images cropped from the dataset. Please clarify.\n\nDiscussions:\nAuthors point out that exemplars help improving performance. However, comments on OSQ vs KLD and ADRS vs DEDS would be appreciated, especially if a connection between the methodology and results can be speculated.  \n\nPage 3, Fig. 2: CAM Module (Class Activation Mapping?) is never defined in the manuscript. \nPersonally, I have a hard time following the images used in Fig. 2; e.g. what do the nature images resemble? There seems to be a small patch of heart image going in, then saliency map of a full resolution nature image, which goes into saliency maps of rotated shark images. The caption should include all necessary information to properly understand the figure.\nPerhaps authors can consider replacing it with a simpler (maybe abstract drawings?) images or simply an explanatory block schematic. Also, authors should pay attention to the flipping ""CNN"" text inside the classifier.\n\nPage 4: ""classwise average saliency maps"": This seems to imply that all images have to be aligned? How sensitive are the results to the manually cropped heart region and the 10 degree rotation used for data augmentation? \n\nPage 5: ""Each of these grids is evaluated by the trained model after a task for their prediction probabilities by themselves"". Please clarify whether the prediction probability is referring to classifier prediction or the saliency map.\n\nPage 5: ""A threshold can be imposed and all n grid regions contributing can be summed up to express the Overall Saliency Quality"" Does this imply that the value of n changes for every instance based on how many of its grid regions pass the threshold? Please clarify.\n\nPage 6, 3rd line: ""[...] it is not always true in case of classes with significant diversity and multiple sub-clusters of exemplars"". Can the authors elaborate on ""multiple sub-clusters of exemplars""? Do they refer to some classes possibly having different clusters in the ""input distributions"", hence class means may lead to suboptimal samples being picked as exemplars?\n\nPage 7: variable ""n"" was already used in Page 5 for a different term. Furthermore, it is ambiguous (is it ""new"" as in new instances and ""o"" is ""old""?) and should be defined for second and third equations on the page.\n\nPage 7: ""For the distillation terms, the original labels not being available [...]"". Authors should comment on why the original labels would not be available at an incremental task schedule in their motivation.\n\nPage 7: ""For the distillation terms, the original labels not being available, y_o^{ij} is computed with new and retained examples and compared to stored logits for the old examples p_o^{ij}, giving a loss term [...]"" Is it possible that the variables are confused? In a typical distillation loss between teacher and student predictions, predictions from the teacher (a.k.a. stored logits for the old examples prior to the new stage of task) are replaced with the labels, while predictions of the student (a.k.a. logits evaluated during the ongoing stage of task) are log-scaled. From the text, one would interpret the contrary.\n\nPage 7: Distillation loss is defined as L_{KD}, which is misleading since the only connection with KD seems to be how the stored exemplar instances were picked. However, L_{KD} is evaluated for the union of the set of exemplar instances and the set of new instances. Authors should consider renaming this loss term.\n\nPage 7: Parameter regularisation for already trained weights using ""Frobenius norm"": Please define how \\mu is computed or picked. In addition, please comment on how sensitive the proposed method is on the picked \\mu, as one would imagine it can have a high impact on the plasticity of the network for new training instances.\n\nPage 7, Discussion line 4: Please define ""no retn"". The corresponding sentence can be changed with ""Variants of our approach without storing rehearsal exemplars (i.e. no retn) are also considered in Table 1."" Also, It is not clear if the authors are referring to ""Fig. 3"" or Table 1 in the Appendix.\n\nPage 9, ""Fig 3"": Figures/tables should be self-explanatory. Please indicate the metric for Map Quality in the caption. In addition, please clarify Task 1, 2 & 3 somewhere. Initially, in Methodology, the sets of classes were introduced in the order of 4C view, LVOT, and 3V view. However, soon after, it is said that 6 of these classes (in a different grouping of the previously defined groups) are learned as base categories (clarification needed for ""base categories""), and remaining 3 are used for class incremental learning; reducing the number of tasks to a total of 2. Later in the appendix, the order of tasks is switched to 4C view, 3V view, and LVOT.\n\nPage 11, Appendix, Training: Please clarify that the split of datasets ensures frames from a subject (out of 12) does not get split between training and testing sets.\n\nPage 12, Appendix: There are 2 Fig.1s.\n\nAdditional questions:\n- Page 4, line 4: Are the specific classes of 2 stages; first 6 and then the other 3, purely picked as a design choice?\n- Is the exemplar size of 30 instances found empirically? Can the authors comment on whether the number of exemplar instances is a sensitive parameter?\n- How are the network weights initialized for a new stage of task?\n\nGrammatical/typographical errors:\n- Pay attention to \'.\' (full stops) and \',\'; some sentences are missing a \' \' (space).\n- Page 4: ""These structures are considered for demonstrating our approach because of their relevance in the assessment of congenital heart disease [17].""

The example shown in Figure 5 could simply be a hand-picked case where Hippodeep and the proposed method produce a very similar result. If the aim was to show that the proposed method can generalise to another dataset, a more thorough evaluation is required.

The differences in accuracy improvement of SA, SA combined with AS, and AIFT selection methods are demonstrated. A problem of introducing potential correlations in the selected observations when the selection criteria are based on the same CNN model is exemplified. The authors’ solution is to decouple the SA part so that the informativeness criterion depends on the CNN prediction uncertainty, while the representativeness criterion does not take CNN predictions into account.\nAggregative Supervision is essentially a simple and working intra-class clustering (stacking images of the same class into 2 x 2 collages)  used for image augmentation, which is shown to improve the results further.\nAdditionally, an illustrative introduction with the overview of the existing Active Learning strategies utilized in CNNs is provided.

It has also objectively received a lot of recent interest in the ML community, with the potential to design new architectures that are both simple and with more expressive power than what has been proposed so far.\n- The related work seems to be adequately cited in parts 1 and 2.\n- The application to 3D image segmentation presents serious challenges in itself, and it indeed seems to have good novelty, although I am not an expert. The method is sound, in particular the use of the Gumbel-softmax trick is a good answer to the challenge of scaling to large architectures.\n\n| Weaknesses:\n- Key claims are made without basis. The interpretation of the experimental validation is distorted to suit the claims.\n- It is unclear how to interpret the (slightly) higher score of ""SCNAS (transfer)"" in Table 1; and whether it actually makes a case for SCNAS as stated in the paper.\n- There is a lot of repetition/verbosity in the first 6 pages.

Whether the contribution is specifically in the application to 3D medical image segmentation or also w.r.t. the methodology itself could be clearer.\n\n| Main comment:\nFrom the abstract to the experimental section, to the conclusion, the authors make a repeated claim w.r.t. performance that is contradicted by experimental validation:\n- Abstract: ""On the 3D medical image segmentation tasks with a benchmark dataset, an automatically designed 3D U-Net by the proposed NAS framework outperforms the previous human-designed 3D U-Net as well as the randomly designed 3D U-Net""\n- Introduction: ""Experimental results [...] show that in comparison to the previous human-designed 3D U-Net, the network obtained  by the proposed scalable NAS leads to better performances""\n- Experiments/Results: ""Table 1 shows that the SCNAS produced better architectures than the (human-designed) 3D U-ResNet as well as the randomly designed 3D U-Net in terms of the overall performances on all three tasks.""\n- Conclusion: ""Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the automatically optimized network via the proposed NAS outperforms the manually designed 3D U-Net.""\n\nHowever, in Table 1. all the scores are within (plus or minus) a fraction of dice or a dice point (SCNAS transfer excluded, see comments below.).\n\nThe paper would be stronger (i) without the contradiction between claims and results; and (ii) if the emphasis was shifted away from the (lack of) experimental evidence for improved performance of the NAS, to a more thorough empirical analysis of the auto-ML mechanism, with an open discussion. \n\n\n| Miscellaneous:\n- ""It is noted that unlike these architecture hyperparameter optimizations, we use the complete NAS to obtain the entire topology of the network architecture in this work."" Is that the case? My understanding is that the high-level architecture (U-Net) is fixed. The distinction is not a minor one in terms of outcome. The proposed approach optimizes over cell architectures, where a cell is e.g. an encoding unit in the encoder path. Same nature cells are further restricted to the same topology. Such optimization appears to yield rather intricate cell designs (cf. appendices) but does not significantly improve performance (Table 1.). \n- It is unclear how to interpret the (slightly) higher score of ""SCNAS (transfer)"" in Table 1.

Essentially, a deep architecture is defined that:\n(1) allows to estimate an unbiased atlas/template of an image population during network training in an unsupervised fashion\n(2) when trained can be used to estimate mappings between formerly unseen images and the atlas\n\nTo do so, an approximation of the conventional LDDMM atlas building objective is proposed, which is solved by the network/training process presented in the paper. The architecture itself consists of an encoder and a decoder part. The encoder maps an input image to a low-dimensional latent space while the decoder maps a point of the latent space to a deformed version of the atlas that is most similar to the input image. It is important to note that the decoder is composed of three different components (1. latent space to momentum field mapper, 2. EPDiff solver, and 3. atlas image warper) and only the first component is actually learned.\n\nOverall, the paper addresses two important problems (diffeomorphic image registration and atlas building) that have not gained much attention by the deep learning community so far. I, therefore, agree with the statement made in the paper that it is the first to introduce a deep learning-based atlas building method using LDDMM (DL-supported LDDMM registration itself was also used by Yang et al./Quicksilver). The approach presented is quite interesting and well in the scope of MIDL as it allows the integration of components of the  well-known LDDMM framework (i.e. EPDiff integration) directly into network architectures to facilitate, for example, deep learning-based computational anatomy methods where the use/estimation of diffeomorphic mappings is crucial. Furthermore, I also like the fact that the authors actively support the idea of open and reproducible research by making their source code available on github (I took a look, but did not review the code) including a PyTorch-module for EPDiff. The evaluation presented can be characterized as somewhat preliminary with only limited experiments (only conventional vs. new atlas building methods for affine and non-linear atlas building are compared) and no real quantitative results. However, the main problem I see with this paper is related to its clarity about a key part of the method presented. \n\nAs I see it, the key part of the paper in terms of novelty is Sec. 2.2, which describes the new atlas building method and how it is solved by using diffeomorphic autoencoders. The introduction of Eq. 8 is easy to follow and the basic description of the autoencoder approach (bottom part of p. 4) is also intelligible. However, at least to me it is somehow unclear how \\overline{I} (the atlas image) is actually computed during the training process. Is it directly learned on a voxel/pixel basis, generated by applying the estimated transformations to the input images, or ...? Maybe I am missing something but this detail is crucial and needs to be added to the paper or clarified if present. I also recommend to describe the network architecture in more detail in Sec. 2.2 as it is hard to understand which parts of the decoder are actually learned and which are static without referring to Sec. 3. This could, for example, be done by moving parts of Sec. 3.2/3.3 to this Section and by improving Fig. 1.\n\nTo sum up, I like the paper and I think it should be presented at MIDL, but the part describing the training-based atlas building should be revised prior to publication.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- LDDMM-based deep learning approach for image registration\n- Atlas building problem solved by training an autoencoder network\n- PyTorch code publicly available', 'cons': 'Cons:\n\n- Description of the novel parts of the method (partially) unsatisfactory\n- Preliminary evaluation', 'rating': '3: accept', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature'}		Hkg0j9sA1V	SyWiNc1XN	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper19/Official_Review	[]	1		['everyone']	Hkg0j9sA1V	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper19/AnonReviewer3']	1547834520516		1548856725774	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper19/AnonReviewer3']

It is a very clear paper, well written, and easy to understand. Details are adequately provided in the limited space of this conference paper. The performance is considerably high, and multiple magnification rates did provide additional information to make the classification even better than the mono-magnification strategy. The deep learning framework was reasonably designed and the parameter effect was sufficiently compared. The sample size is decently adequate and training/validation/testing are rigorously designed. Imbalance problem was correctly handled. Therefore, it is a really exceptional paper showing a good application of deep learning in real clinical problem, which deserves a praise. \n\nThe pros are: 1) large sample size, 2) rigorous experimental design, 3) correct model selection and parameter tuning, 4) the implementation and integration of multi-resolution images. \n', 'cons': ""Some minor issues, constructive suggestions, and future works:\n1. The intensity calibration or normalization to the WSI and tiles should be described. \n2. One rater labeled the image, which could lead to some extend of bias and human errors. Thus, the accuracy could be not “the higher, the better” but could have bias. More raters should be enrolled and their consistently labeled results should be considered as gold standard. \n3. Application issue: The whole task is relatively easier than grading task (identification of different tumor cells). The future work could be, based on the current model, another deep classifier should be trained to do this harder (but more useful) task.\n4. Does the method work on tiles that have been extracted from the WSI, or it directly works on the WSI?  It seems that a pathologist will first manually label the 400x images with 1 of the 6 labels using contours, then the non-overlapping tiles are extracted based on the contours and the algorithm works on these tiles. In future, since the model has been trained, can this whole process be fully automated and directly work on WSI itself?\n5. It's not quite reasonable to make images different magnifications include different areas simply in order to make sure their sizes are the same. The motivation should be provided. In my opinion, this is to introduce certain (larger-scale) context information so the algorithm could use to better make decision.\n6. Certain overlap can be used when extracting tiles so that the algorithm could give a heat map with probabilities and class labels so that all these information could be superimposed to WSI to train raters (a possible application) and to guide pathologists to focus on tumor cells to make further grading decisions. \n7. Please verify: Parameter optimization for each of the 3 models are carried out using training + validation sets only? The testing set is only used for final performance evaluation, correct?\n8.

It is somehow original since I have not yet seen networks reconstructing voxel-based shapes from landmarks and vice versa from that resolution. The resolution is impressive. The abstract and introduction are well written and motivated. The paper is slightly above the page limit but I think that is adequate. The paper is reproducible, especially since both, code and data is or will be made available.', 'cons': 'Coming from the shape modeling community the paper did some weird design choices and especially the validation of the approach should be improved.\nMy main criticism is the choice of landmarks as latent representation. This leads to a one-to-many mapping to shapes. The shape modeling community tends to model a posterior distribution in such a case. Usually, the aim is to learn this latent representation and I only see drawbacks in this explicit choice. The task is compared to other approaches fully supervised and therefore the spatial resolution is less impressive than for an unsupervised method learning the latent representation. The statement that this resolution was not reached before should at least be put in context to ""Octree Generating Networks: Efficient Convolutional Architectures for High-Resolution 3D Outputs"" at ICCV 2017 presenting a convolutional decoder reaching a resolution of 512^3.\nThe task of reconstructing a shape from landmarks is well studied e.g. by the modeling of posterior distributions. \nThe weakest part of the paper are the experiments. It is hard to estimate the performance of the approach based on those experiments and since the for me obvious experiments or visualizations (see later) are missing. I honestly expect its performance is pretty bad.\nI would suggest to further work on the paper and especially improve on the experiments.\n\n\nHere some detailed comments and suggestions:\n\nIntroduction: \n- The limitation of classical SSMs are not fair not all models are limited to variation by principal modes - a lot of models allow some additional deformations that are regularized not by the statistics of the training data (e.g. Gaussian processes).\n- The statement that the mandible is one of the most complicated and variable anatomies of the human body is weak - it is not obvious to me why that is the case. I would also not agree that cars, chairs and tables are well-formed shapes. The challenges are different, chairs or teeth for example have the challenge of adding or removing legs/roots.\n- The choice of the network architecture looks arbitrary. Choices in the methods part are not motivated and it basically only contains the architecture and the loss functions. The sentence ""we experimented with many deep neural architectures, one of which is depicted in Figure 1"" is perhaps honest but is supporting a trial and error approach instead of a deeper idea behind the architecture.\n- Section 3.3. is named Experiments  but contains a description of the choosen latent space. Since the learning is fully supervised I would expect that to be part of the methods section.. The actual  experiments performed are described in the results section.\n- The results section contains two different tasks, landmark estimation and reconstruction. I think additional structure with titles would improve readability.\n- Table 1 shows the reconstruction performance given landmarks. The presented values appear extremly high to me. Instead of comparing it to a proper baseline it is compared to the task of segmentation which does not make sense in my eyes. As a simple baseline I would propose to add the thresholded average of the original voxel maps or a reconstruction based on the average landmarks. This would indicate if and how much better the reconstruction is than just taking the average of the data.\n- The average fiducial-to-surface distance measured was 1.89 mm - this again feels quite big. Other publications working on mandible landmarks show the performance per landmark - this could perhaps be added to Figure 2 (since some landmarks are not well defined like the one on the tip of the teeth in front which is not available in the full dataset.\n- For the average surface distance 1.2 mm should also be set in the context of the average as prediction.\n- The shape modelling community came up with some measurements of modeling quality (generalization, specificity, compactness). A full loop would therefore be interesting: New unseen shape -> estimate landmarks -> reconstruct shape.\n- Figure 3 is missing the landmarks - without the given landmarks those reconstructions don\'t help in estimating the quality of the reconstruction.\n- The landmark reconstruction performance of 3.84 again is hard to evaluate without comparison or context. Since no values to compare are given I head to search for one - so I don\'t know if the comparison is fair, but ""Deep Geodesic Learning for Segmentation and Anatomical Landmarking"" (TMI 2018) estimated landmarks from images with an segmentation before - they reach ~ 1mm. Adding a figure to allow a qualitative estimation of the quality could help here.

Therefore, such models obviously need more iterations to converge to the same performance than when they trained without regularization or data augmentation. When training all the models for 100 epochs, as well-shown in Figure 4, we let the model with no augmentation to overfit while we prevent the others from overfitting.

Three-fold cross validation is performed to evaluate different parameter combinations. A comparison is made between networks trained with different sample ratios for liver and background samples, and random based sampling. Furthermore, networks trained with the weighted cross entropy loss (WCE), in which voxels are weighted based on thresholding and the liver mask, are compared with networks trained with the Tversky loss. The best results are obtained with a network that was trained with the WCE loss, and a sampling ratio of 50% between liver and background samples.\n\n-\tThe paper is clearly written. \n-\tThe idea on how to choose your training samples to enhance your performance is interesting to explore.\n-\tNot only the Dice coefficient but also distance metrics such as the ASSD and MSSD are computed, giving a better understanding of the results.\n\n', 'cons': '\nSeveral details are missing in the paper:\n-\tIt is unclear which activation function is used in the output layer of the network.\n-\tWere the networks only trained on axial slices?

Did balancing the data also outperform previously presented liver segmentation methods? The method of balancing your data on itself is not very novel, therefore it is unclear what the contribution of this paper is.\n-\tBased on fig. 4, the network trained with TVE seems to have a higher FN rate (missing quite a bit of liver in the segmentation), would adjusting α and β improve results?\n-\tThe paper shows that a ratio (r) of 0.5 obtained the best performance. However, this seems specific for liver segmentation. Could the authors elaborate on how this r might change based on the organ of interest (for instance smaller organs probably need a smaller r due to the chance of a high FP rate otherwise). Furthermore, do the authors think these setting are also able to optimally perform on a test set that comes from a different dataset?\n-\tBecause the Tversky loss already deals in some way with class imbalance, it might be that the networks perform less good due to an overkill of balancing the data.

282	1548261243814	{'pros': 'The paper makes the case that existing NAS approaches, especially those that replace discrete variables with continuous approximations, are insufficient for very large architectures such as those used in 3D segmentation, and the authors select the widely used U-Net as their exemplary case. This makes a compelling case for the proposed method, which consists of drawing two entries from the probability vector of possible realizations (operations in this case) at a given iteration, clipping the remaining probabilities to zero and renormalizing, with the benefit of reducing the number of activations from N (8 in this work) to 2 for each operator that is part of the optimization process. While no quantitative analysis of computational savings is offered, it is clear that they are considerable.', 'cons': 'While the method certainly has merit, the experimental results do not do it justice. The segmentation performance obtained with SCNAS is below state-of-the-art and even compared to their own baseline (3D U-ResNet) the improvement is not convincing. The former could in part be explained by the missing data augmentation (the authors address this) while the latter could be the simple fact that the baselines can already cover a large enough function space to find a good approximation of the target function (given the limited amount of training data), so that the architecture search has negligible influence. I list my concerns in more detail below.\n\nMajor: \n\n1. The baseline models chosen for this study do not represent the state of the art. The reader can only be convinced of the merit of this paper if it can outperform the state of the art, which in the case for the heart and prostate dataset used here is nnUNet, the winning contribution to the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (Isensee et al., 2018). While Isensee et al. used an ensemble of different models for their final submission, their paper also reports five-fold cross-validation results with their 3D UNet (without ensembling) on these datasets. The 3D U-Net results reported by Isensee et al. are better than any of the results reported in this manuscript. In addition, the 3D U-Net used by Isensee et al. is very basic with no major architectural variations. As such, it could have been an ideal baseline candidate to demonstrate if SCNAS can really advance the state of the art. It should further be pointed out that, in general, the 3D UNet used in Isensee et al. is rather similar to the UNets used throughout this work with the sole big difference being the number of pooling operations ([3,3,3] in the case of this manuscript vs [5,5,5] (heart, brain tumor) and [2,5,5] (prostate) in Isensee et al., see Table 1). The statement “We conjecture that Isensee et al. (2018) might be benefit from complicated pre-/post-procedures and thus obtained slightly better performances than the SCNAS.“ does not sufficiently explain the difference in performance. In fact, the preprocessing used by Isensee et al. for MRI images is basically identical to the procedure used in this paper.\n\n2. In Equations 2 and 3, the authors state that the optimization of the edge weights is done on the ‘validation set’. It is unclear however to what set this actually refers to. In the experiments, the authors report results of a five-fold cross-validation. In order to draw any kind of meaningful conclusion of the this cross-validation results, it is important to clarify whether the validation set of the splits were used for this optimization or whether the training set was again split into two sets. If the performance of the models is estimated via cross-validation then the validation split cannot be used for any kind of optimization!\n\n3. “SCNAS produces a more generalizable neural architecture for the similar tasks of 3D MRI image segmentation “. There is no evidence in the paper that would support this statement. The authors must also transfer their baseline models and see if the performance of the transferred baseline models is better or worse than that of SCNAS.\n\n4. The authors state that SCNAS performs significantly better than the other approaches. Even if we ignore the previous concern, I would only buy that claim for the peripheral prostate zone. In all other categories the standard deviations (?, see also minor-8) are too large to support this statement without an actual test.\n\n\nMinor: \n\nThe authors do not give sufficient details about the “Random Search” result. How was this network architecture obtained? How many different configurations were drawn randomly and how was the best model selected?\n\nTraining large 3D segmentation networks is very computationally expensive. It is clear that the authors must have had access to a fairly large GPU cluster. If would be interesting to have more specific information about how many GPUs were used (in total and per model) and how long one of the models needed to train. \n\nHow did the authors handle the different number of input channels when transferring their network from brain tumour (4 channels) to heart (1 channel) and prostate (2 channels)?\n\nThe authors state that they compare SCNAS against a 3D U-ResNet and an attention U-Net, but no results are reported for the attention U-Net.\n\n“the input images were first resized for all voxel spacings to be physically equal using the given meta-data“. It is unclear what spacing the data was resampled to.\n\n“Note that unlike Isensee et al. (2018), any heuristic pre-/post-processing techniques including data augmentation, network-cascade, and prediction-ensemble were not adopted in this evaluation to solely examine the effects by the use of NAS in designing the network architecture.”: While it makes sense to drop ensembling and cascaded architectures for this work, the argumentation that the lack or data augmentation better isolated the effect of NAS is lackluster. In fact, including data augmentation would likely have improved the results somewhat across the board and thus made the results more convincing.\n\nFigure 2 a): in brain tumor segmentation it is more common to show contrast enhanced T1 sequences alongside with T2 or FLAIR to allow the reader to see all parts of the tumor properly. If only one of the sequences is shown then this should probably be the contrast enhanced T1 because enhancing tumor is not visible in the sequence presented here. \n\nWhat type of error is reported in table 1?\n', 'rating': '2: reject', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}		S1lhkdKkeV	BJeEFwM8QV	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper34/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	S1lhkdKkeV	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer3']	1548261243814		1548856722281	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer3']

In particular, the paper focuses on data augmentation strategies to improve performance of large-capacity models. The authors propose to use a variety of data augmentation strategies, including an approach they call 'pertrurbed normalization'. This approach consists of shift-and-scaling data to values picked randomly rather than 0 mean and unit variance as commonly done. The authors also compare the performance of classical regularization strategies. The evaluation is done on an ADNI subset.\n\nOverall,  it is valuable to evaluate and compare various augmentation and regularization techniques for a medical imaging task.

There are also several issues with clarity.\n\nI detail these points below.\n\nMAJOR POINTS\n\n1) An issue with the novelty claim for \'perturbed normalization\' is that the technique is equivalent to PCA-based data augmentation [Krizhevsky2012, section 4.1], which also results in random shifts and scaling of the intensity distribution of images. I have also seen the exact same random mean and standard deviation normalization technique used in practice, although I could not find a specific paper reference or options in popular deep learning packages (keras, tensorpack, mxnet...). Color jittering is also closely related, and implemented in several packages, e.g. torchvision\'s ColorJitter (random brightness, hue, etc...), mxnet (e.g. BrighnessJitterAug and others) and others. Torchvision\'s transforms.Normalize allow the user to custom-set the desired mean and std.\n\nThe authors should explicitely cite and compare their approach to Krizhevsky2012 and color jittering.\n\n2) As presented the paper lacks clarity. In particular\n- Page 5, perturbed normalization: are \\sigma and \\mu related to the estimated data standard deviation and data means? \n- Figure 4: Show loss rather than or in addition to accuracy. Keep vertical scales consistent between training and validation. It would help generalizability claims if authors showed results for other splits (cross-validation) - it\'s not necessarily the case that the behaviour would be the same given different sampling of the data.\n- The authors should provide a breakdown of sex and age and test for differences between groups\n\nThe authors should provide more details necessary to evaluate and reproduce the work.\n\n3) The empirical evaluation is insufficient.\n- The test set is unbalanced (around 1:1.5). The authors should report balanced accuracy or at both precision and recall in table 2.\n- How many new volumes where generated in each augmentation case? \n- How many new volumes were generated for the \'full augmentation\' case? It may be that the apparently superior performance is just due to having more data, rather than the complementarity of augmentations\n- No augmentation: what condition is that exactly, compared to the rows above?\n\nThe authors should also use at least another open dataset (Look at OASIS, FCON1000 etc.) to strengthen their analysis\n\n\nMINOR POINTS\n- Discussion ""we achieved high accuracy..."": AD versus controls on ADNI routinely reaches 85%+ accuracy using simple linear methods on e.g atlas volumetry.

However, the results don’t show evidences. Could the deep models be simpler with a proper preprocessing? Could the models be more stable and improve their convergence rate? Which is the trade-off between depper models and proper preprocessing? Ect. \n\n\nRelated work:\n- It could be appropriate to introduce some of the recent works about the preprocessing effects, which are not “virtually non-existent”.\n\nMethods. Data description:\n- Several scans from the same patient are employed in the training or alternatively the validation phase. How are the results affected by this decision? \n- It would be nice to use some of the images included in the paper to complete the description of the classes (blood, oedema, etc.), in order to guide readers without the needed anatomic knowledge.\n\nMethods. Spatial normalisation:\n- Image registration is a complex process which can vary the images in several ways. Due to the focus in the preprocessing, the employment of an in-house tool does not seem really appropriate. It would be better to employ one of the available validated frameworks for this task (or several in order to establish a fair comparison).\n- Usually images are rotated, translated, ect. to feed a CNN during training in order to generalize the model, in this work is the opposite. This effect should be measured.\n- Readers could not be familiarized with “MNI space”. A small introduction is needed. \n- In Figure 2 the slices in each column (before/after registration) are quite different, why?\n\nMethods. Skull-stripping and intensity windowing:\n- It seems like the windows are too small, which is probably reflected in the results similarity, specially taking into account that skull-stripping is an easy step in CT images and can be easily handled by a CNN. \n- Are there hyperintense areas in your sample? How are they affect by this process?\n\nMethods. Model architecture:\n- While the architecture is well defined and can be reviewed in the “DeepMedic” paper, there is a lack of information about the training phase: transfer learning? Optimization? Learning rate? Patches? Iterations? Etc. \n- As I expressed above, the paper should be extended in order to compare the segmentation with other models, so in my opinion, the details about the employment of the U-Net are insufficient. \n\nResults\n- There are not measures about how different are the results among the experiments which must be essential in order to establish the proposed conclusions.  \n- Figure 4, specially for TBI, shows some extreme outliers, why? In my experience these points are usually due to really small areas. Sometimes, these effects can be removed with the appropriate preprocessing steps which could be essential for the purpose of this work. \n\nDiscussion: \n- In my opinion, the results does not show any proper evidence of improvement under the employment of any kind of preprocessing. The differences are not clear. An hypothetical reader, who is looking for the best pipeline to segment head CT images would infer that is not necessary to perform any preprocessing. \n- “we achieve a maximum Dice score of 52.1...”. In average?\n- “which still falls behind the best result reported on MRI 64.5±16.3”. Would you use preprocessing to reach these results employing CT?

302	1548176134776	{'pros': '\nSUMMARY\n\nThe paper “Spherical CNN-Based Brain Tissue Classification Using Diffusion MRI” presents a neural network that classifies reconstructed diffusion weighted MRI signals into white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. \nThe network utilizes spherical convolutional layers (sCNN) with rectified linear units (ReLU) as activation function and ends with fully-connected layers that perform the classification task. Training is based on constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) orientation distribution functions (fODF) as input and anatomical FAST segmentations as label of a single (human connectome project) subject.\nEvaluation is performed in an inter- and intra-subject manner within the HCP project.\n\nPROS\n \nThe proposed approach utilizes a new and - for the field of diffusion imaging - very interesting method: the spherical convolution.\n\n', 'cons': '\nCONS\n\nUnfortunately, there are numerous weaknesses, hence only the most serious ones will be covered here:\n\n(1) The chosen network input:\nIn order to find a good response function (RF) for a CSD reconstruction, a meaningful white matter mask is required for big datasets due to computational constraints. Therefore, using CSD fODFs as input to predict the white matter mask, which is required during generation of the input signal, does not make much sense. \nFurthermore, it should be taken into account that the fODF was generated by deconvoluting the diffusion signal with a single RF. It should therefore be easily possible for a network to learn a convolution, while the plain diffusion signal can be utilized as input.\n\n(2) The networks structure:\nMain purpose of the sCNN layers is to keep the spherical signal structure from layer to layer.\nSince the goal is to classify the input, keeping the spherical structure does not seem important for a good classification. \nFurthermore, applying ReLUs to the Spherical Harmonic signal completely removes this spherical structure, since all values <0 are set to 0. Applying different activation function (e.g. sigmoid or tanh) would most probably keep the spherical structure, in case it might be beneficial for classification. \n\n(3) Evaluation:\nThe biggest drawback of the current evaluation is that no other method was evaluated for comparison. The easiest way to compute a segmentation would be to apply FSL’s FAST on the b=0 diffusion weighted signal. Another possible comparison would be a four-layer neural network with 16, 32, 128 and 3 neurons per layer. This would prove the possible improvement due to the spherical structure.\nThe statement that the network can also be applied to other datasets/subjects needs further investigation, since the HCP Project is a very homogeneous dataset. To this end, it would have been important to evaluate other scanners, different resolutions and different numbers of gradient directions. For a proper evaluation, at least the resolution and the number of gradient directions should be evaluated, as these have a direct influence on the fODF.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper utilizes an interesting network structure for an important task within the field of diffusion imaging. Unfortunately, it doesn’t get far with it.\nAs the paper states itself, only preliminary results are presented. It would therefore be recommended to further improve this work.\n\n\n', 'rating': '1: strong reject', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature'}		BJgm2DkJgN	r1xJMipE7N	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper27/Official_Review	[]	1		['everyone']	BJgm2DkJgN	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper27/AnonReviewer3']	1548176134776		1548856717783	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper27/AnonReviewer3']

Especially the use of uncertainty weighted multi-task loss is a great feature of this work. Also, the experiments to verify that SNNs outperform BN networks for these tasks, is a positive contribution. Especially given the fact that also standard deviations seem to have been reported.\n', 'cons': '\nAlthough this can be considered a valuable contribution there are two main points that need to improved / clarified:\n\n 1. (CRUCIAL) It is not clear whether the quality of the model has been assessed in a correct fashion. First of all, it is not reported how hyperparameters were selected. If a proper hyperparametersearch is not possible, that is okay, but these hyperparameters still have to be chosen and that is mostly based on some part of the data, which might introduce a positive bias if test data has been used. It is also not clear how exactly the CV is done. If each fold consists of exactly 1 subject and there are 13 subjects in the training data, it is not obvious how 5-fold CV can be applied. Finally, section 2.1. mentioned 14 subjects and from section 3. it could be deduced that 13 subjects are used for training. Is it correct to assume that 1 subject is used for testing purposes? If so, this should be clearly stated. In general, there should be some statement how the data was split up and how each part was used.\nThe reviewer bases his overall rating on the assumption that hyperparameter selection and assessment was performed correctly. The authors should add a paragraph/section on hyperparameter selection and assessment at a prominent position in the manuscript. \n\n 2. The paper is hard to read due to grammatical issues and typos in the text and might lead to misunderstanding. Also the formulas contain inconsistencies and typos/failures, e.g. equation (3). Since the formulas are mostly from the referenced work, it should not be a problem to correct this accordingly, however. \n\nOther remarks:\n  - Since V-net is a segmentation network, it might make more sense to talk about ""V-net encoder"" or ""V-net inspired CNN"".\n  - The ""residual"" connections in V-net are rather skip-connections with the sole purpose to aid in reconstructing the segmentation map for the original image. The improved gradient flow is rather a side-effect of residual connections, just as it is a feature of most normalization strategies (not regularization).\n  - For the weight initialization of SNNs, $n$ is the number of INPUT units to each layer. The units of a layer generally denote the output units.\n  - Kendall et al. denote the $\\sigma$-parameters as measures of uncertainty rather than noise.\n  - It is not clear what the last sentence of section 2.4. means. Is an extra loss term added to force weights towards a standard Gaussian distribution? This also seems to be contradicting the fact that weights should have a variance of 1/n. This needs some clarification.\n  - It is nowhere stated what the underscore numbers in tables 1 and 2 represent. The reviewer assumes standard deviations.\n  - In the conclusion (section 4.), the overfitting problem is mentioned. Is this the overfitting on specific tasks in the multi-task setting? If not, it might be useful to expand on how this loss function could avoid overfitting.\n  - Also in the conclusion, the performance subjects #3 and #2 are mentioned, but this is pretty meaningless without the explicit results for these subjects.\n\n', 'rating': '3: accept', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		ryxPCJNexV	S1gLH9iVmE	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper92/Official_Review	[]	1		['everyone']	ryxPCJNexV	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper92/AnonReviewer1']	1548167741591		1548856717527	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper92/AnonReviewer1']

In this sense, manually labeled images will not be needed anymore. And the segmentation could potentially help prediction.  Other clinical factors could also affect progression prediction, which could include some non-MRI or even non-lesion-related factors.\n2. Attention network for identification of  the important imaging features. The contribution of lesion label and why it helps the prognosis are not discussed very well. Although it could be included in an independent study in the future, the most contributing brain regions should be identified and discussed (maybe using attention neural network?) to further help clinicians. \n3. Include more scans from different follow-up times to consider the baseline differences among samples. Also please include the baseline clinical scores in the model.  Although the most intuitive idea of using this data set is to use baseline MRI data to predict changes in clinical scores. However, it\'s more proper to use changes in MRI (i.e., 4D image appearance changing trajectories) to do more accurate and reasonable prediction. \n4. In the future, the current model should be compared with a model predicting the normalized delta(clinical scores), i.e., changes/baseline_level, as the final output. Different subjects have different baselines (Table 1), if only using baseline MRI scans to build the relationship to recovery, the factor of baseline performance could be a non-negligible influencing factor', 'rating': '4: strong accept', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature', 'special_issue': ['Special Issue Recommendation']}"		rkliARLel4	rkgpaDAm7N	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper112/Official_Review	[]	1		['everyone']	rkliARLel4	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper112/AnonReviewer1']	1548113861077		1548856715729	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper112/AnonReviewer1']

They treated sequence discrimination and contrast enhanced image discrimination as two separate classification tasks and tried to concatenate these two to let the first task help the second (more difficult) task. The accuracy of sequence classification is high, and that of the contrast image discrimination is lower but still acceptable. \n\nThe pros is that this study utilize a modern classification framework with better performance than traditional machine learning algorithms to deal with a new problem. DICOM sorting has been previously based on manual or toolbox-based methods (with the latter only used certain specific DICOM information, which could be easily removed during data sharing or not feasible in some cases). Generally, this paper proposed a good solution to this problem in real data analysis. \n\nAnother pros is that this study used a rigorous validation set instead of cross validation, which reduces the concern of over fitting. The performance is thus more reliable. \n\nThe third pros is that this paper, for the first time, proposes that DICOM sorting can be done based on images themselves, rather than only on the DICOM information. This is very innovative and should be encouraged in the MRI study field. Deep learning should be playing more and more roles in the traditional MRI processing field. ', 'cons': 'The biggest concern from the reviewer is that the paper, when introducing the background, did not mention currently existing software and toolboxes for DICOM sorting ""based on the information retrieved from DICOM files"". Actually, to the reviewer\'s own experience and best knowledge, there is always that one of these available toolboxes works well on DICOM sorting and they are designed based on very simple ""matching-based"" scripts. The results of these toolboxes is that the DICOM files belonging to the same scan (whatever this scan is for T1w, or T2w, or something else) will be put into a new folder with their common sequence name. The reviewer acknowledge and agree with the authors that these sequence names could be different for different scanners and imaging centers and even different imaging staffs. However, it is usually easy to make a decision on whether this folder is all T1w or T2w, or T1w or fMRI, or T1w or DWI, etc. In certain cases, researchers need to visually check the files in the folder to make sure of their modalities. For example, to make sure whether it is T1w or T1wC,  but again, this is not quite common, and application specific (e.g., tumor studies that both have T1w or T1wC but the decision cannot be made based on their DICOM information) -- in this case, image-based sorting could be of help.  In addition, the goal of DICOM sorting is not only for sorting the dicom files but also make them better transformed to NIFTI format, where the dicom files belonging to the same scan will be converted to a single nifti file (multiple slices to a single 3D image). The paper, however, seems more likely to treat each slice as a basic unit for the following analysis and do a simple classification task.  Therefore, the reviewer suggests that the paper should be revised by adding certain application scenarios into the story telling and acknowledge these existing automatic dicom sorting software & toolboxes. It\'s better to provide, with real application(s), why traditional dicom sorting software & toolboxes could fail but the proposed method could work.  The reviewer agree that it is all for future applications and the current version of algorithm subjects to future extension, but by adding some additional comparisons will further convince people to use or to contribute in it. \n\nSpecific comments are given below:\n1. The authors did not mention software for dicom sorting, e.g., MRIconvert, dicomsort function in REST. These toolboxes automatically read dicom info and, based on that, sort them into different folders. It usually works, and is really fast. It also works for data from different scanners or from different runs/scans.\n2. The application this paper proposed is quite specific to structural MRI data sorting. However, in more general cases, functional data (different scans of fMRI, DWI) are also needed to be sorted. This will add more complexity in the algorithm and could be hard sometimes. \n3. For image preprocessing, reslicing to the same dimension could be unfeasible because there exist thick-slice and thin-slice images. And, if a slice includes too much background, then, it could be calibrated too bright as the background is always very dark. Instead, a 3D-version of normalization could be better. In addition, z-scoring is feasible for whole training or validation set, however, it cannot be applied to a single testing image.\n4. The real data this paper used is highly specific. If imaging categories were changed, then the model cannot be used.  If the images are from high-grade glioma rather than LGG, the results could be different, as HGG has different contrast than LGG in terms of T1C.  \n5. The reviewer is not sure if the performance reported here is solely based on the validation set.\n\nSuggestion: \n1. The authors should compare the accuracy and timing of their method with traditional dicom sorting software.\n2. Since PD is not always scanned in other studies. If it is removed from the final target, the accuracy of sorting other modalities could be even better.\n3. Both PD and T2-FLAIR have big potential to be sorted as T1w or T1c, why? Did the authors check the inconsistent results?\n4. The lower performance in Table 6  is reasonable because T1w and T1wC look very similar in LGG images, i.e., glioma itself is not enhanced. The only differences could be in the big vessel and artery.

As authors stated, dense connectivity and dilated convolutions have already been proposed in many other segmentation problems. Therefore, the technical contribution of this paper is very limited. In addition, there exist some other recent works that have included dense connectivity in UNet architectures.\n- Choice of hyperparameters is not motivated. For example: 'Compared to standard U-Net, most importantly, our model uses dense connection in layer seven to nine. For example, both layer one and two are concatenated back to layer nine after deconvolution'. Why to employ those connections and not connect all previous with subsequent layers? Why to employ only one dilated convolutional layer before the bottleneck? Which would be the effect of adding more dilated convolutions through the entire network? As one of the advantages of dilated convolutions against pooling is to increase the receptive field without scarifying resolution, replacing pooling layers by dilated convolutions would have a positive or negative effect?\n- Authors also state that one of the benefits of the proposed network is to reinforce the features reuse. Nevertheless, I somehow feel that authors fail to demonstrate this. In Table 4 they show that by employing 50% of the parameters performance only decreases by 2-3%.

There is a nice features reuse analysis in the original DenseNet paper (Fig. 5), as well as in this medical segmentation work, where authors show the importance of features reuse at different layers ([1], Fig. 6).\n- Two major concerns with the evaluation is the date when authors accessed the challenge results and the metrics employed for evaluation.

In particular:\n\n--> The evaluation using the estimated optic disc diameter (which is a function of each region coordinates) showed that the performance is still too poor compared to human experts (Table 1). Figure 4 also shows that the differences with the ground truth are way too high yet. The lack of baselines turns really important this comparison.\n\n--> The evaluation metric is not standard for this task, according to recent literature in the field [1]. Authors should evaluate the performance of the algorithm using the Euclidean distance of each predicted localization with respect to the ground truth, and also using the success rates applied in [1].\n\n--> It is clear that this task was never done before on this imaging modality. However, it is necessary to see if this novel architecture is the way to solve the problem or if adapting an existing approach is already enough. Authors could use the public implementation of [1] (as released in https://github.com/minesmeyer/od-fovea-regression) to have at least an automated method as a baseline. \n\n--> Table 1 includes too much information and it is really difficult to understand. As far as I see, the results of the observers were obtained on a subsample of 100 CP images. However, the CNN metrics were computed for all the images in the set. As a consequence, the values cannot be directly compared. Moreover, including the results of laterality classification does not aid this comparison. I would suggest to report the results in different tables: one for the OD/fovea localization and one for laterality classification. In the table for OD/fovea localization, I would suggest to report the performance of the algorithm on the full sample of images (authors can include there the results of the baseline, too). The comparison with the experts could be done using a box-plot, a new table or a Bland-Altman plot. \n\n- It is no clear why the authors did not use a single branch to accomplish both OD and fovea coordinate determination. Was this a design choice based on empirical evidence? Have they observed that separating both tasks do not help to improve performance? If that is the case, it would be interesting to report the results obtained by separating the tasks, too, for comparison purposes. Otherwise, I believe it is necessary to separate them: the fully connected layers are the only task-specific parameters, so each of the tasks might need their own parameters to obtain better results. Maybe one valuable alternative is to share a second fully connected layer, and then split the tasks on a third one. \n\n- One important thing to consider in multitask learning is the weighting between each of the tasks. According to the draft, authors did not weight each of the losses but summed them up to get a single value (which is equivalent to set a weight of 1). It would be interesting to see if balancing the losses using different multipliers can improve the results of the OD/fovea detection task.\n\n- Some other comments:\n\n--> The related works section did not include the recent approach presented in [1].\n\n--> Please, rephrase the second paragraph in Page 6. It is not clear if there are repeated subjects in the training/val/test sets.\n\n--> The laterality classification task looks certainly solved. It would be nice to include in Section 3 (Materials) the number of left/right images at least in the test set, to see if Accuracy was a suitable metric for evaluating the results.

Importantly the paper does not show the performance of baselines on the in-house dataset it employs, not even the simple and extensively used U-Net is evaluated comparatively. Furthermore, despite claiming otherwise, the paper lacks novelty as adversarial networks have already been employed on a prostate segmentation task.\n\nThe following list gives more detail to the above assessment:\n\n1.\tThe paper merely states ‘Among various deep learning approaches, Generative models have shown to be one of the most promising models for the segmentation tasks’, but doesn’t give any other motivation for why they choose this model class. There are good reasons why this could be attractive, but they are not explained here. This lack of motivation also weakens the experiments/results as there is no context that is specific to this model class (deterministic models could have been evaluated in the presented fashion, and in fact they should have, see below).\n2.\tThe paper states ‘To the best of our knowledge, no work has been done towards prostate MRI segmentation using generative models’. This is wrong, as there is a paper using conditional adversarial networks to segment prostate MRI: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08014\n3.\tThe introduction refers to different segmentation models employed for segmentation but omits a recent one based on variational inference, the Probabilistic U-Net (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05034).\n4.\tIn essence the paper trains cGANs on a training dataset which is altered by application of different filters (blurring & deblurring). It is unclear why this requires cGANs (again no motivation is given) and regular deterministic models could have been employed.\n5.\tAlthough at the core of the papers’ analysis, the exact composition of the different datasets (and the model training) remains unclear. It is unclear in what proportion raw and noisy images were combined on the respective datasets and whether any data-augmentation was used whatsoever. If no further data augmentation was employed it is rather unsurprising that adding blurred/de-blurred data to the training set improves performance.\n6.\tTable 1 results seem quite inconclusive and the discussion thereof does not seem to present it in a more structured form either.\n7.\tThe robustness analysis lacks clarity/context, e.g. why is $h_j$ mutiplied by 3? Also, on ADC & DWI, The DSC results for Denoised(h_i^1) look significantly different from Denoised(h_i^2), so it is unclear how the robustness claim can be made from these experiments?\n8.\tIt is unclear whether training images were sampled indefinitely when noising/denoising them. From the discussion section it could be inferred that this is not the case (as it is being implied that combining raw + noisy + de-noised incorporates more training examples than e.g. raw + noisy). Assuming they were not, the number of raw and the number of noisy images in their respective datasets should be equally large. If so, it seems hard to explain why the segmentation performance on the test set improves when trained on the same images but all of them are blurred by a filter (true for both ADC & DWI). Why is that?\n9.\tThe Pix2Pix model from ‘Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks’ was employed. In the paper it was found that the models learned to ignore the injected latent noise, which was mitigated by using ‘unignorable noise’, i.e. drop-out here. Fig. 2 suggests the present paper still injects latent noise. It would be interesting to learn whether the authors managed to condition the models on this noise rather than e.g. dropout.\n10.\tFig. 2 seems wrong as it is said to depict a cGAN but the generator is not conditioned on an input image, as shown presently, it is only conditioned on noise.\n11.\tIn Table 2 the method’s performance is compared to entries in the PROMISE12 challenge. The paper appears to compare its DSC performance achieved on the in-house dataset of 40 patients versus the PROMISE12 results. This does not make much sense and raises the questions of why a) the cGAN approach was not trained and was not submitted to PROMISE12 (the current DSC of 0.73 does not even make it into the top 200 on PROMISE12, so Table 2 is both misleading and very unfavorable) and b) why well performing approaches on PROMISE12 were not used as baselines on the in-house dataset. Simple U-Net approaches arrive at 0.89 DSC on PROMISE12 and should have been compared to in the considered tasks.\n\n\n', 'rating': '2: reject', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature'}		rJleFANp1E	H1lGP4fmmV	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper8/Official_Review	[]	1		['everyone']	rJleFANp1E	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper8/AnonReviewer2']	1548063833963		1548856713907	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper8/AnonReviewer2']

Furthermore the problem of opacity detection/classfication in lung CT images is a good choice for this, as there are a range of potential abnormalities and this is an important and common clinical problem.\n\nThe adversarial autoencoder approach they have taken is generally well-motivated and promising, though I have some specific concerns (see below). Whilst the results are clearly not yet at the level of supervised methods, I believe they are promising for an unsupervised method and therefore the paper represents an important advance. The authors make a good case for considering both local and global representations when performing clustering.', 'cons': 'The most important downside of this paper is that insufficient detail is given to enable readers in the community to reproduce the experiments.\n\nConsider the CAAE schematic in Figure 4. The definitions of Block 1 and Block 2 do not give crucial details such as the number of feature channels at the output of each convolutional layer block, the size of the convolutional kernels, the size of the max-pooling operations, the stride used in the deconvolution operation, and how the convolutional feature map is reshaped into a feature vector at the end of the encoder (is it a global max pooling operation or a flattening operation?). I would recommend either including these details in Figure 4, or adding the additional details in an appendix, which is permitted by the MIDL format.\n\nAnother important missing detail is how non-lung ROIs, for example patches containing muscle/fat, spine, and/or mediastinum, are treated by the model during training and testing. It appears that they are not treated as the ""normal"" class, which judging by the images in the bottom row of Figure 7 is reserved only for normal regions within the lungs, but there is no mention of a ""non-lung"" class used during training. Are these ROIs simply omitted from training and testing? If so, this process would require initial segmentation of the lungs in the images at both training and test time. This could be done either manually, which would dramatically decrease the usefulness of this model as an ""unsupervised"" learning method, or automatically, but no details are given of this.\n\nHowever the most important missing detail is how the classifier is obtained once the GMM clusters have been found. The paper describes how the model is trained to produce 192D feature vectors for a given combination of ROI and slice. It then describes at the end of section 2.2 how these are clustered using a GMM algorithm to give 64 clusters. But then absolutely no detail is given about how the mapping is defined between these 64 clusters and the 6 classes. It is very important to explain this step in detail for reproducibility but also because it is important to understand how much labelled data is used for this process, as presumably there must be some. If the entire training set is used the this purpose, the method cannot be described as an unsupervised method. The method is only useful if this mapping can be learnt with only a few labelled examples.\n\nThere are also no details given of how the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. This is a very worrying omission. If it is simply an omitted detail then it can be easily fixed in the revised submission, but *if the images on which the precision/recall results are reported were also used to train the model then the results are close to meaningless as the generalisation performance of the model has not been demonstrated*.\n\nAnother weakness of this paper is that the dataset is highly imbalanced between the 6 classes, but there is no method for alleviating this problem described. It is notable that by far the worst performance is achieved on the nodular class, which is also the most under-represented class in the training set.\n\nSome of these missing details are critically important. If all these issues are resolved satisfactorily in a revised submission then there may be a case for accepting the paper, but in the current state it cannot be accepted.\n\nAs a comment on the chosen methodology, the authors\' choice to use a plain Gaussian distribution for the prior distribution in the CAAE and then perform post-hoc clustering of the feature vectors deviates from the original Adversarial Autoencoder paper (Makhzani et al 2015, Adversarial Autoencoders, https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05644 ). This is especially surprising given that the authors cite the Makhzani paper as the primary source for the AAE method. In section 6 of that paper the authors describe a method to perform unsupervised clustering by incorporating a categorical \'y\' variable directly into the latent representation of an image, which learns the cluster assignment during the adversarial training process. It seems likely to me that this method would result in better class separation than the method used in the current paper. The authors should therefore justify their deviation from the methodology of their primary source.\n\nAs a minor detail, the authors appear to be be using the term ""linear"" to distinguish convolutional layers from what I guess are fully-connected layers. The authors should clarify this point.

The paper gives a good motivation for why it might be beneficial to take into account image ambiguity and tries to give an answer as to how current segmentation architectures could be endowed with the ability to predict multiple appropriate segmentations given an image. There is an effort to evaluate the model on 3 different datasets.', 'cons': 'The paper is based on a shaky assumption and some of its details with respect to the model and evaluation seem to lack in precision or appear questionable.\n\nFirst of all, the proposed architecture hinges on the assumption that linear interpolations between the intersection of all masks and the union of all masks for a given image, and thus variations in segmentation size, can be considered plausible segmentations. Although this is indeed one variation that is observed in medical images, there are many other forms of variation including more intricate differences in shape or even discontinuous ones, which this approach ignores. \n\nThe proposed model is trained to recapture linearly interpolated segmentations that are artificially obtained from 2 expert segmentations per image. The interpolation is parametrized by a size encoding factor \\rho and is further used to condition the model by means of i) scaling the negative slope of some of the used activation functions and additionally ii) scaling the length of a latent vector z. The model choices lack motivation, are not clearly presented and no evaluation of the individual model choices is presented, e.g. importantly for why a hypersphere autoencoder is used. The hypersphere loss appears to be no more than a regularizer on z’s norm and there does not seem to be any incentive for the network to encode semantics via z (because the U-Net can encode all of the semantics in higher resolution features that are skipped across the bottleneck by means of the employed residual connections). The reviewer would have appreciated an analysis for the impact of the z-scaling via \\rho alone, i.e. without scaling the dynamic ReLUs. As it stands it would not be surprising if the network fixes z, e.g. |z| = 1. This would thus not require a hypersphere auto-encoder, but the network could be conditioned on a scalar \\rho, e.g. as is already done via the dynamic ReLUs. Therefore there is suspicion that the hyper-sphere formulation does not have any bearing on the method.\n\nFor the first two of the datasets only qualitative results are discussed. On the third and final dataset the proposed model as well as U-Nets trained with different ground-truth segmentations are compared on localization performance. The centroids of up to 3 connected components for each model are matched and compared against ground truth biopsy locations. The significance of the improvements over the baselines is unclear. In particular, the amount of images for which the predicted ‘sweetspot’, n_{sws}, encapsulates the gt biopsy location seems comparable for both the proposed model (HAE) and a simple U-Net trained on the ‘sweetspot’ groundtruth. For a singular biopsy the sweetspot U-Net is even better. Standard deviations on all evaluation metrics should be reported to allow for an assessment of significance of the presented results. Moreover, the localization accuracy per image seems to be an inappropriate measure here, since a random model reaches 100% accuracy. This indicates that every test image had undergone biopsy, which means that a singular positively predicted pixel per image results in a correct detection according to this metric. As the paper is concerned with semantic segmentation and the models are trained via a Dice-loss, it would have been illuminating to also report the Dice test set results. \n\nThere are additional details that should be revisited:\n1) Mention more related work, e.g. works that condition networks by means of multiplicative interactions with feature-maps, which is essentially what the present work employs, as well as literature on hypersphere variational auto-encoders.\n2) Describe the training process in detail.\n3) There is neither a motivation nor an evaluation for why residual- rather than skip-connections are being employed in the U-Net.\n4) An architecture that models conditional segmentation variations, the Probabilistic U-Net, is mentioned, but not compared against on the given datasets. A glance at the corresponding paper also reveals that their method does indeed outperform a suite of others on a real world dataset with ambiguities contrary to the claim in the Introduction, and the work seems akin to what is proposed as future work in the Discussion section. Furthermore this paper employs a publicly available dataset, which could have also been used to compare on.\n5) How do the actual assessors’ segmentations perform in terms of $d_{biopsy}$ on the respective others segmentaion? This would give some more insight into the expected variability on this measue.\n6) A claim is made that ‘taking biopsies is harmless’.

One might argue that the approach is (at least partially) a combination of different pre-existing methods/papers (U-Net, Data sharing layer, FlowNet, …). However, I think all choices are reasonable and according to the results of the extensive and convincing evaluation, this combination leads to excellent results.\n\nFurther comments:\n\n- I think the discussion of the state-of-the-art approaches most relevant to this work should be extended. In my mind, especially Schlemper et al., 2017 (why wasn’t their 2018 TMI paper used instead?) should be discussed in much greater detail as it is the key competitor in the evaluation. In this context, it remains also unclear why only Schlemper et al., 2017 was used in the evaluation as a representative of deep learning-based reconstruction methods (why not Qin et al., 2018 and Huang et al., 2018). This choice should be discussed in the paper.\n\n- In Fig. 3, the location of the axis captions seems to be odd. They should be placed directly adjacent to their axis to improve readability.\n\n- What is so special about frame #9 that all approaches struggle to reconstruct this image? I assume it is one of the two extrema (end-diastolic phase or end-systolic phase) of the cardiac cycle. Couldn’t this problem for MODRN be alleviated by choosing z_1=end-diastolic phase and z_T= end-systolic phase or vice versa?\n\n- Are the differences between MODRN and all other approaches statistically significant? Please provide results of statistical tests, if possible.\n\n- The original FlowNet paper should be cited.\n\n\nPros:\n- Novel method for learning-based reconstruction of spatio-temporal MR image sequences\n- Explicit inclusion of motion information in the reconstruction process by using a FlowNet-like motion estimation approach\n- Extensive evaluation with very good quantitative and qualitative results', 'cons': 'Cons:\n- Reasons for the selection of competing state-of-the-art approach in the evaluation unclear\n- Paper is sometimes hard to follow', 'rating': '3: accept', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}		Bke-CJtel4	S1xDD7kgm4	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper122/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	Bke-CJtel4	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper122/AnonReviewer3']	1547854686776		1548856711336	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper122/AnonReviewer3']

331	1547825268765	{'pros': 'Summary:\nThis paper presents a method for automatically classifying the sequence of brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The method has two steps. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the images among 4 categories: “T1-weighted”, “T2-weighted”, “T2-weighted FLAIR” and “proton density”. This network uses information from DICOM tags as well as from the image. Second, another CNN further classifies “T1-weighted” images into two classes: “pre-contrast” and “post-contrast”. The networks are called “sequence-CNN” and “contrast-CNN”, respectively.\n\nClaims of the paper:\n1.\tThe proposed method can classify brain MRI into 5 sequence types accurately. Therefore, it can be used to sort a dataset of brain MRI faster than doing it by hand.\n\nPros:\n* This is the first time that the problem of brain MRI sequence classification is solved using CNNs.\n* The study is well written and easy to follow.\n* The authors validate their method using an independent publicly available dataset.\n* They provide access to the code used to reproduce the experiments.\n', 'cons': 'Cons:\n* There is no methodological novelty in this paper. Off-the-shelf CNNs are trained on brain MRI to solve two classification tasks. \n* There are strong limitations regarding the validation of their method in the presented application: \n    * Limited performance of sequence-CNN: sequence-CNN performs barely better than the baseline method that completely ignores the images (only about 3% relative improvement on average). It even underperforms the baseline for the T2-FLAIR category. Furthermore, the authors do not perform any test of statistical significance, e.g. retraining the CNNs with different weight initialization and comparing the performance scores with a T-test. Based on the presented evidence, it cannot be concluded that sequence-CNN is significantly better than the baseline. \n    * Limited performance of contrast-CNN: 17% of the brain MRI are misclassified by contrast-CNN. This result casts doubts on whether this method can be used in a practical setting.\n    * Since the goal of this paper is to introduce a method that can substitute or aid a human annotator, it would be very informative to report the performance of an external human observer in both classification tasks. This information is key to understand the potential as well as the limitations of the proposed method.\n* The authors claim that the proposed algorithm can be used to sort a dataset of brain MRI faster than by hand. It is not clear how they would use this method in practice given the imperfect performance reported in the paper. If the labels are not known in advance, and the algorithm does not classify all images perfectly (or indicate uncertainty), how can it aid a human annotator to be faster or more accurate? Knowing that there could be mistakes in the predictions, an annotator would have to go through all the images regardless of the algorithm’s predictions. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the paper suggesting that the annotator would complete this process faster due to having the model’s predictions. \n* Why are DICOM tags not used with the contrast-CNN?\n* An entire page is used for 3 figures with basic information.

332	1547814141128	{'pros': 'Summary:\nThis paper presents a method for conditional image generation based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. In particular, the authors extend the Pix2Pix model by including convolutional capsule networks (CapsNets) in the generator network, and called it CapsPix2Pix. They used Pix2Pix, CapsPix2Pix and a physics-based model to generate images of two datasets conditioned on their segmentation labels that look indistinguishable from the real images. Subsequently, they trained a series of UNet segmentation networks on several real and generated images, and compared their performance on a common test set. \n\nClaims of the paper:\n1. It is possible to train a successful conditional GAN with a CapsNet-based generator. \n2. Pretraining the segmentation network (downstream task for evaluation) with generated images from CapsPix2Pix improves segmentation performance compared to no pretraining. \n3. Training the segmentation network from scratch with generated images from CapsPix2Pix improves segmentation performance compared to training with generated images from Pix2Pix. \n4. CapsPix2Pix generates a large variation of images compared to Pix2Pix.\n\nPros:\n* This is the first paper demonstrating that it is possible to perform conditional image generation using convolutional capsule networks in the generator of a GAN. They managed to generate 256x256 grayscale images.\n* The authors write an extensive description of hyper-parameter values and implementation details. Furthermore, they promise to publish their code and data very soon. Doing so will definitely help other researchers to adopt GANs and CapsNets in the future.\n* The paper is well written and easy to follow in general.\n* The authors include plenty of images that provide context and help the reader to understand the methods and results.\n', 'cons': 'Cons:\n* There is limited methodological novelty in this paper. The authors took an existing network architecture (SegCaps from LaLonde and Bagci 2018) and used it as a generator model in an existing conditional GAN framework (Pix2Pix from Isola et al. 2017). Notice that other authors have used CapsNets in the discriminator before, but not in the generator.\n    * A significant part of the paper is devoted to explaining preexisting ideas such as GANs, CapsNet and dynamic routing.\n* There is limited validation regarding the application presented by the authors. In particular, I found that claims (2), (3) and (4) are not sufficiently supported by the evidence shown in the paper:\n    * (2): when comparing pretraining UNet with CapsPix2Pix versus no pretraining it, they show a relative improvement of 0.76% only (0.6876 vs 0.6824 Dice), less than 1% difference. A test of statistical significance would be required to justify this claim (see next bullet point for more on statistical tests performed in this paper). At most, it could be said that both techniques achieve similar performance. Furthermore, figures A3 and A4 show indistinguishable performance at convergence.\n    * (3): similarly as with (2), a small improvement between techniques is reported, inconclusive without a significance test.\n    * (4): this claim is based on Figure A6 where only 1 example is provided. Since there is no page limit on the Appendix, more examples could be shown. Crucially, these examples should not be cherry-picked but selected at random (the authors do not mention how they chose the reported example).\n* Regarding statistical significance, the authors perform T-tests and provide p values. However, variation between performance metrics should not be measured across test samples (Table A1). Instead, the authors should repeat the training of UNet networks multiple times with different weight initialization, obtaining a series of performance measurements where the T-test is performed. For example, let’s say the number of repetitions is 5, and we are interested in comparing PBAM-SSM with pix2pix-AR (first and second entries of Table 1). Then, 10 UNets should be trained, i.e. 5 networks for the first method and another 5 for the next, obtaining 2 series of 5 performance metrics (5 Dice scores per method, each one the average across test samples). Finally, significance would be studied by comparing these two populations with a T-test.\n* The qualitative results and analysis are difficult to follow given the variety of datasets, methods and metrics.

This is an important issue and I think that authors should take that result into consideration and modify the claims (and perhaps the title) accordingly. Provided that these modificiations are done, I believe that the article could be certainly accepted. Current performance of vessel segmentation algorithms is close to the one of human observers doing the task manually, so using a segmentation as input would not be really a problem.\n\n- It it not sufficiently emphasize that the methods for synthesizing vascular trees are novel and were not explored before. \n\n- The algorithm requires a starting point to extract the vascular graph. This position is by definition the central, top pixel in synthetic images. However, it is not clear which point is used when working on retinal images. This is also an important thing to consider. Using a single vessel from the optic disc is usually not enough, as some images might show more than one vessel spreading from this region. In [1-4], all the models solve the issue by taking root nodes in the intersection of the optic disc border and vessels. Did you follow a similar idea?\n\n- Is the model based on segmentations (not in skeletonizations) able to solve vessel crossings such as the one illustrated in Fig. 4 (c), bottom? Usually the skeletonization algorithms introduce a small piece of vessel there due to the overlap between vessels. If the proposed method is able to overcome that issue, then it might have really good implications in many applications, including blood flow simulation [1-4], where these ambiguities introduce false branching points that significantly affect the results.\n\n- Some other minor suggestions:\n\n--> It should be clarified in the introduction that Fraz et al. survey is focused only on retinal images and not in blood vessel segmentation in general.\n--> In lines 8 and 9 of the introduction, there is a repetition (""biomedical scans"").\n--> Although it is clear that the estimated vessel width is correlated with the manual annotations (Fig. 7 (b)), it would be interesting to complement those results with the R^2 value of a linear regression model and a Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Liu, D., Wood, N.

This is important when processing these images, where anatomical and pathological structures usually share similar visual properties and lead to false positive detections (e.g. red lesions and vessels, or bright lesions and the optic disc).\n\n- The adversarial loss allows to leverage complementary data sets that do not have all the regions of interest segmented. Thus, it is not necessary to have all the classes annotated in all the images but to have the labels at least in some of them.\n\n- The contribution is original in the sense that complementing data sets is a really challenging task, difficult to address with current available solutions. The strategy proposed to tackle this issue is not novel as adversarial losses have been used before for image segmentations. However, it is the first time that it is applied for complementing data sets and have some interesting modifications that certainly ensures novelty in the proposal.\n\n- The paper is well written and organized, with minor details to address in this matter (see CONS).', 'cons': '- The clear contribution of the article is, in my opinion, the ability to exploit complementary information from different data sets. Taking this into account, I would suggest the authors to incorporate at least one paragraph in Related works (Section 2) describing the current existing approaches to do that.\n\n- It is not clear from the explanation in Section 3.1 how the authors deal with the differences in resolution between DRIVE and IDRID data sets. It would be interesting to know that aspect, as it is crucial to allow the network to learn to ""transfer"" its own ability for detecting a new region from one data set to another.\n\n- The segmentation architecture does not use batch normalization. Is there a reason for not using it?\n\n- The vessel segmentation performance is evaluated on the DRIVE data set. Despite the fact that this set has been the standard for evaluating blood vessel segmentation algorithms since 2004, the resolution of the images is extremelly different from the current ones. There are other existing data sets such as HRF (https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/), CHASEDB1 (https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/retinal/chasedb1/) and DR HAGIS (https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/niall.p.mcloughlin/DRHAGIS_database.htm) with higher resolution images that are more representative of current imaging devices. I would suggest to incorporate results on at least one of these data sets to better understand the behavior of the algorithm on these images.\n\n- The area under the ROC curve is not a proper metric for evaluating a vessel segmentation algorithm due to the class imbalance between the TP and TN classes (vessels vs. background ratio is around 12% in fundus pictures). I would suggest to include the F1-score and the area under the Precision/Recall curve, instead, which have been used already in other studies (see [1] and [2], for example, or Orlando et al. 2017 in the submitted draft).\n\n- The method in [2] should be included in the comparison of vessel segmentation algorithms. To the best of my knowledge, it has the highest performance in the DRIVE data set compared to several other techniques. It would also be interesting to analyze the differences in a qualitative way, as in Fig. 3 (b). The authors of [2] provided a website with all the results on the DRIVE database (http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~cvlsegmentation/driu/), so their segmentations could be taken from there.\n\n- The results for vessel segmentation in IDRID images do not look as accurate as those in the DRIVE data set. However, since IDRID does not have vessel annotations, it is not possible to quantify the performance there. It would be interesting to simulate such an experiment by taking an additional data set with vessel annotations (e.g., some of those that I suggested before, HRF, CHASEDB1 or DR HAGIS) and evaluate the performance there, without using any of their images for training. That would be equivalent to assume that the new data set(s) does (do) not contain the annotations, and will allow to quantify the performance there. Since the HRF data set contains images from normal, glaucomatous and diabetic retinopathy patients, I would suggest to use that one. A similar experiment can be made using other data sets with red/bright lesions  (e.g. e-ophtha, http://www.adcis.net/es/Descargar-Software-Base-De-Datos-Terceros/E-Ophtha.html) or optic disc annotations (e.g. REFUGE database, https://refuge.grand-challenge.org). I think this is a key experiment, really necessary to validate if the method is performing well or not. I would certainly accept the paper is this experiment were included and the results were convincing.\n\n- It is not clear if the values for the existing methods in Table 2 correspond to the winning teams of the IDRID challenge. Please, clarify that point in the text.\n\n- The abstract should be improved. The first 10 lines contains too much wording for a statement that should be much easier to explain. I would suggest reorganizing these first line by following something like: (i) Despite the fact that there are several available data sets of fundus pictures, none of them contains labels for all the structures of interest for retinal image analysis, either anatomical or pathological. (ii) Learning to leverage the information of complementary data sets is a challenging task. (iii) Explanation of the method...\n\n\n\n[1] Zhao, Yitian, et al.

On the other hand, images that the algorithm gets ""right"" are unchanged, even if the label, and algorithm, are wrong; this is the source of the bias. To prevent bias, the entire dataset should be regraded blind to how the algorithm performed. While the paper only deals with changing labels in the training data, which is ok, a thorough discussion about bias is warranted and claims about this methods applicability to testing or validation datasets should be omitted and strictly discouraged.\n\nThe methods in this paper introduce bias that will inflate the performance of the algorithm in a manner that will not be realized in real-world applications. \nReal-world labels are not randomly incorrect. 6% of the images were intentionally changed, assuming randomly. In the real-world, the vast majority of mislabeled exams will contain very few obvious exams. By randomly changing the labels the paper only demonstrates that training data with better labels will perform better, and says nothing about the method of under evaluation.\nWhen the labels in the paper were identified, they should have been blindly re-graded rather than reset to the predetermined correct value. This would much more effectively evaluate how the algorithm would perform in the real-world.\nOne correct way to conduct this study is to use the original labels when gathered from their source rather than starting out by regrading all images to have the correct truth then randomly flipping labels. I know nothing of the hospital data, but the Kaggle competition data came with labels, many of which are incorrect. This would have served as a real-world evaluation of the model.\n\nThe title of the paper is misleading: ""An automated method of identifying incorrectly labelled medical images"". The method automatically identifies candidates for which the label may be wrong, but requires manual determination to see if the algorithm is correct. In the dataset analyzed, the positive predictive value of the algorithm was slightly less than 50%, suggesting that if the labels were assumed wrong in an automated fashion that the algorithm would be ineffective.\n\nThe accuracy point for model A"" is in the incorrect location in Figure 4A.\n\nFeature F6 in the K-means clustering is completely dependent on F4 and F5.

In particular, Figure 1 is excellent in simultaneously describing three different network architectures in a concise manner; very well done! Figure 2 is also exceptionally done. \n\nThe motivation for the work is clear and the results are described in two very relevant applications.\n\nI have not seen a similar network architecture and believe it to be unique. The network architecture is also very relevant to the task at hand with few arbitrary design decisions. It is unclear why the number of iterations was fixed rather than allowing to optimize on the validation network, but I commend including all data necessary to replicate the study.\n\nOverall, the network architecture is novel, the experimental design is mostly well-done.

I understand the point that this narrative is trying to deliver, and believe that the narrative should be in there, but as written the text is untrue. In the narrow definition of classification and segmentation networks provided, this would be true. However, the definition provided misses a wide range of published networks that do not fit the criteria and are able to segment 1D lines from 2D data. In the paper, base model 1 is able to segment 1D lines from 2D images and is very similar to AlexNet. Examples of this have been published in the context of retinal layer segmentation as well: ""Shah et al. Multiple surface segmentation using convolution neural nets: application to retinal layer segmentation in OCT images"".\n\nIn the Results section comparing algorithms for GA segmentation, there is a comparison of Dice scores compared across OCT-volumes in the dataset. A single Dice score was calculated per OCT volume. The proposed model had a mean and std dev of 0.49 +/- 0.21 while base model 1 had a mean and std dev of 0.46 +/- 0.22. The sample size, in number of volumes, is 20. The next sentence indicates that the proposed model is significantly better with a p-value < 0.01. I do not see how this can be true. I am not a statistic expert, but comparison of two algorithms on the same OCT volumes could use a paired student t-test. Since I do not have the paired data, an unpaired t-test gives a p-value of 0.66. It is possible that each B-scan, or even each A-scan, was used to calculate statistical significance, but that would not be the correct approach as well as the data within a single volume would be highly correlated.

In the corresponding experimental setup description, only the value of lambda_gdl is mentioned. Please also provide weighting values for the other two terms.\n - In Section 2, the authors mention that many false positive residuals are avoided by optimizing for the gdl term, but this is a statement without proof. I kindly ask the authors to evaluate the performance of a comparison model where the auto-encoder is trained without the gdl-term.\n - I think Section 3 needs to be revised in order to present the results in a more clear and better structured way.

How are non-empty slices determined?\n     - The title of Section 3.3 does not mention supervised deep learning, though a fully supervised experiment is conducted as well. Maybe a different subsection-title would help?\n     - In Section 3.3, the term ""lower bound"" is confusing. A supervised trained model is compared against unsupervised and semi-supervised models and is the lower bound? As the results show, this is also not true. I would recommend to use completely different notation/naming of the compared models. For instance, the authors could use the used labels for notation (instead of ""lower"", ""SS"", etc. --> ""Y_MS"", ""Y_MS + S_MS"", etc.). This should then also be reflected in the subscript-notation of X/Y/S: (X_MS,Y_MS) denotes the pair image+ground-truth in the ""MS"" dataset; (X_MS,S_MS) denotes the pair image+artificial-label in the ""MS"" dataset; etc.. \n     - Change the name of the ""unlabeled"" subset in D_MS, since labels of this data are used in the experiments. Maybe ""Addtional Training Set""?\n     - Use a shorter subscript for D_MSSEG2008-CHB as long as there is no specific reason for this long version.\n     - It could be useful to introduce the X/Y/S notation in table 1, but once the authors revise this Section they will see if this is a useful suggestion or not.\n     - Introduce the experiment pipeline and its target directly at the beginning of the subsections.

The reader can derive it from the context somehow, but this is unneccessarily difficult.\n     - Section 3.4: again the notation of the models is confusing.

What is ""AUPR"" (i guess it is area under the precision recall curve, but this should be mentioned)?\n - In the discussion the authors mention ""that AU S is slightly inferior, which is due to FPs in segmentations (see Figure 2 C) provided by the UAD for training the segmentation network. The FP in S are learned and again reflected by the segmentation model."" The authors should weaken this statement, if they just observed many false positives in the output of the autoencoder in a qualitative assessment. At least they should mention which evaluation was performed that leaded to this conclusion.\n - The authors state ""We even outperform the upper bound model B_upper which has been trained from labeled data of both domains."" Be clear about which dataset and model are you referring to (i guess itsMSSEG2008-CHB, but please state it). In the next sentence the authors claim that ""The same effect is noticed in the experiments involving the D_MSSEG2008-UNC dataset,..."", which is not correct.

They use an old method (classify the centre pixel of a patch in the image) with the idea that it will use less memory and expand the data available since it will be as many samples as available voxels. However, this is unlikely the case. More modern approach like a 3D U-net (Ö Çiçek et al. \u200e2016) should fit in a modern consumer grade GPU like 1080Ti. The ""extra"" data will be highly redundant since neighboring pixels are basically the same patch, there therefore a lot of the operations during training will be redundant. It would be better do data augmentation (e.g. random shifts and rotations). If they are concerned about sample imbalance they could just weight the loss for each pixel according to the sample weight.

Neural networks are used to train patch based predictors that predict nodes, which are then used to successively build trees of interest. Different neural networks are evaluated on synthetically generated data and U-net based patch predictor is finalised. This model is then evaluated on DRIVE data, comprising colour retinal images. Further, an updated U-net based regressor is used to predict vessel width. The preliminary evaluation presented is inconclusive as no relevant comparing methods are presented.\n\nPros:\n- The primary motivation of the work is interesting: to go directly from images to trees instead of binary mask based segmentation\n- Use of neural networks to predict possible nodes in trees\n- The visualisation related work in Section 4 can be interesting.

While not straightforward, there are works on tree-space statistics that can be used to perform evaluations directly on trees (for example in [1]).

One would hope that in a recurrent setting, there is more information for making improved node predictions. So, it is surprising.\n\n- This brings me to my next question: Instead of using sequence-less neural networks to predict individual nodes on small patches, why not train the networks like U-net to predict all possible nodes on the entire image? \n\n- Section 3.1 is ambiguous. It describes three levels of vascular tree construction in ""increasing order of difficulty"". Do the authors see each of these tasks as going from image-to-tree? Because the evaluations in Figure 6 seem to indicate this. Obtaining trees from retinal images is what is most interesting, and this seemed to be the motivation presented earlier.

Finally they perform incremental training by optimizing a loss function which is sum of 3 losses 1) cross entropy classification loss, 2) distillation loss over the new and retained examples compared with only the retained examples and 3) is the regularization term which penalizes the shift in Frobenius norm over the parameters as compared to base model. They demonstrated their proposed strategy on fetal echocardiography dataset, where the base task was to classify 6 fetal cardiac structures namely ventricle walls, valves, left atrium, right ventricles, pulmonary artery, and aorta. They first trained a base model to classify these 6 structures and then incrementally train their base model, to classify 3 new structures namely Foramen ovale, right atrium, and superior vena cava. \n\n•\tThe proposed method combines the different continual learning strategies to present a method of incremental learning for medical images.\n\n', 'cons': '\n•\tThe authors failed to highlight the novelty of their approach.\n•\tThe proposed method’s success heavy depends on the quality of the saliency map produced.

In medical images, usually the different classification tasks vary a lot in terms of difficulty. A small structure like aorta or superior vena cava may be are much more difficult to classify as compared to right ventricle. It is difficult to judge the method from only 2 numbers calculated over all the classes (map quality and percentage accuracy)\n•\tThe degradation of the saliency map is a continuous process, spread over epochs of learning.

Moreover, Tversky seems to balance between precision and recall already, thus not always getting the best dice scores and not a valid choice at all in this comparison.\n\nThe ratio (r = 0.5) seems to have worked for 2D liver slices, however is the ratio generalizable to much smaller or even larger organs where the data imbalance is different per slice?

This is even more important when using patches instead of whole images.\n\nThe meaning of random sampling is relative to the dataset. In datasets with equal number of positive/negative labels random sampling will be equal to 50-50 ratio, whereas in other dataset it may be different. Therefore, the comparison of ratio (r = 0.5) to random sampling should only be considered when you take into account the exact ratio of liver vs non-liver slices in your dataset.\n\nAuthors used a fixed number of positive (liver) slices, while determining the rest (background) based on the ratio (1 - r). Given that, whether the ratio (r) is 0.2 or 0.8, the number of background slices when 0.8 could be four times larger than 0.2.

The network architecture have already been used in previous literature as well as the loss functions.

The authors have stressed several times that precise localization and segmentation of abnormalities in retinal images are almost impossible for humans. Nevertheless, they do not mention any other possible gold standard, and they proposed to use an additional classifier, trained on labels assigned by humans, to evaluate the performances of their architecture in terms of removing abnormalities and generating the related fake healthy images. This looks to me as circular reasoning and although it is reasonable to say that the architecture is identifying and removing abnormal regions, it does not give any reassurance on the fact that all (or as many as possible) the abnormalities are being detected. This is problematic since it is the most interesting goal of the paper together with the one of offering precise localization. I agree that it is hard to validate this on real data, but I do not think the current choice is appropriate.\nThe synthetic data are more suitable to try to reason about this aspect. However, in order to introduce abnormalities in their dataset, the authors used thumbnail images from ImageNet. Although the very small ones can look as just black spots, I do not think this approach is fair, since those thumbnails look so artificial (fig.2, far right) that they offer completely unrealistic data, misleading the validation results.

In clinical practice, I assume the age of the patient will be known and an age group-specific model can be applied. In this case, the noted fine-tuning should be sufficient.\n\nThe authors achieve slightly better results with their approach than with fine-tuning, but I would attribute this rather to the substantially lower number of parameters that are learned as part of their adapted U-net model with mostly fixed weights (except for the newly introduced layers) from a rather small pediatric data set. How would this compare to a simple fine-tuning with only a few convolutional layers of the U-net whose weights are not fixed, e.g., convolution layers at the lowest level instead of adding a separate intensity transformation layer?\n\nThe authors state the goal of a transfer learning method that cannot utilize the source data set. Further, they say their transformation layers may apply the identity transformation to not hurt the performance on adult data. However, as these layers are never learned on adult data, but pediatric images only, these layers do indeed not learn such identity transformation. This is especially noticeable for the geometric transformation layer, which indeed worsens the results on adult data due to the non-identity transformation applied right to the input as seen in Table 1.\n\nIn order to really achieve their goal of extending a U-net pre-trained on adult data to both adult and pediatric images, their introduced transformation layers would need to be trained on both adult and pediatric images. But then again, the authors noted already that in this case joint training of the original U-net does best and there is no need for transfer learning.\n\nSimilarly, adding the intensity transformation layer alone also results in lower Dice overlap when compared to a U-net trained with the few available pediatric images alone.\n\nNeither transformation layer alone actually improves the results as intended. Only a combination of these manages to be perform better on the pediatric images, but worsens results on adult images. Also, this turns out to be just slightly (possibly insignificantly) be better than fine tuning for either age group. The minor difference might be rather explained by a more ill-posed optimization problem in case of fine tuning given the significantly larger number of parameters compared to the small pediatric training set.\n\nGiven above criticism of the overall approach, I would encourage the authors to better motivate it.

Despite the expectation set by title and abstract, the integration of atlas-building with deep learning does not actually produce a machine learning model for atlas formation. At the face of it, the authors utilise deep learning methodology to minimize an objective function for atlas creation during the training procedure. The learned model cannot be applied to create an (unbiased!) atlas from new images, though this is suggested by at least the title of this paper. What is learned, however, is a predictor of the initial momenta that maps an image to the deformable template derived during training, but the authors do not motivate such use and do not evaluate the performance of this template registration for images not used during training. With focus on the latter, the learned model should be directly compared to Quicksilver from Yang et al. (2017). In contrast to Yang et al. (2017), the proposed method does not require momenta that have been pre-computed by another algorithm (e.g., conventional LDDMM). In the discussion of closely related work, the authors do not discuss the method of Yang et al.

In fact, the authors point this out in the conclusion: “Integration of deep learning into the atlas creation methodology promises to enable creative new approaches to statistical shape analysis in neuroimaging and other fields“. I would recommend reformulating abstract and introduction to motivate their approach in this context right from the beginning.\n\nBesides this critique, this paper is in my opinion of interest to the conference attendees and may spark some useful discussions.

The comment “the proposed method corrects the artefact but loses some structural information” from previous paper still seems to hold. No qualitative comparison of reconstructed images with and without SSIM loss is provided.\n-Improved segmentation with no improvement of image quality might not be well accepted in practice by clinicians, so it may be better that both be demonstrated. This is actually what is anticipated for future work by others.\nThe SSIM calculation is not clear. What are the “regions” x and y in this case ? Are they parts of the images around a pixel location p ? Or the whole images (consistently with the notations a few lines above) ? Is Lssim the same for all pixel, otherwise should it be averaged on the whole image - like Lmse  ? Could this be better explained ? \nA limitation of the method is the memory burden for motion correction, as acknowledged by authors.\n\nNote: it might be judicious to drop the few lines defining Dice and Hausdorff distance, which are well-known, and use this space to spend a few more lines explaining the adversarial setting, which isn't so obvious to understand.\n"", 'rating': '3: accept', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		BkgjbQ30yN	SyxN8fWn74	MIDL.io/2019/Conference/-/Paper24/Official_Review	[]	2		['everyone']	BkgjbQ30yN	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper24/AnonReviewer1']	1548649035918		1548856689869	['MIDL.io/2019/Conference/Paper24/AnonReviewer1']

Please correct (during rebuttal) if I have misunderstood something. It seems that the authors motivate general segmentation, but their method is in fact performing segmentation *propagation* between scans of the same subject. They compare a method that is trained to propagate a segmentation (theirs) to a method that is trained to do segmentation de novo (baseline) -- which are significantly different tasks (with the former being much easier). In effect, the first method, the propagation network, *sees* the given (test) subject\'s segmentation (of a different scan), and its task is simply to shift it -- while the segmentation network has only seen training segmentations . A more fair evaluation might be to include the original test segmentations (the ones you propagate) in the training of the seg network, and then evaluate this network on a new scan from the same subject. Alternatively, experiments on propagating segmentations with a trained registration network (of even classical methods) could be done. Unfortunately, the authors do none of these, and they seem to compare incompatible tasks.\n\t- The proposed network is a bit confusing to me -- in the middle of the propagation network, are the deformation and moving image concatenated? The text says that the network ""applies the registration result to a segmentation"", but is this really applying a transform (this doesn\'t seem like it from the figure), or applying another network (a \'decoder\')? If it\'s the latter, it\'s a bit peculiar -- why is this needed, since we know what the transform should do - so the authors could simply apply a transform layer (a la STNs, or some of the registration networks the authors cite). Perhaps I am misunderstanding something, but currently it seems counterintuitive.\n\t- Section 3.2 is a bit confusing as well, why do two images need to be synthesized, why not just one? Is this to add more variability?\nThe authors describe the need to generate ground truth deformations -- but these are ill defined and may limit the types of transforms the final network can deal with.

Essentially, one advantage of discrete methods is that they can search a space of large deformations (e.g. without for example getting stuck in local minima or being too slow). However, to make the method work in a neural network, the authors approximate the discrete method using the concept in 2.3, which makes it continuous, which in a sense is needed by GD/backprop. However, by making this continuous, the method essentially does not live on just the discrete set anymore -- and enables any deformation in practice by aggregating the resulting probabilities. It seems that, although clearly different than other continuous methods (in some way that\'s hard to judge at a deep level), this is essentially continuous now -- making it unclear how much of an advantage it can have over other discrete registration methods (e.g. Hu et al, and Balakrishnan et al, which the author refers to). \n\t- Joint with the comment above, unfortunately, the authors do not compare with those other methods in the results, but instead design a (fairly unspecified)network to compare to continuous registration networks in general -- but this seems difficult to judge, since there are quite a few powerful networks out there that have shown promising results, some with available code, but are not tested here. Is the authors\' ""Regressor EDE"" comparable? Does it, for example, have sufficient conv+down-sampling layer in the registration network part to capture large fields to allow for large deformations? The encoder to regress displacments seems a bit vague. A careful specification of this model, or running one of the other cited methods seems crucial to the claims of this paper.\n\t- Figure 2 Right shows that the trained models are not really converged (they are still going up in terms of Dice -- this could mean that the author is still selling their own method short, but it also does not allow for a conclusion like which model is better. Also, the fact that one method performs better at the beginning is not quite that meaningful if in the long run one still need the same amount of epochs to converge, as is shown in Fig 2.\n\t- The technical development is a bit patchy by joining several concepts together without very good flow/intuition (at least in the text).

Hyper-parameter choices like Laplacian weights, which are set but not explained\n\t- There are several typos throughout the paper\n\t- One of the interesting aspects of the current method is that it is probabilistic, but the author omits recent probabilistic registration work -- see probabilistic registration at MICCAI 2018  and MICCAI-DLMIA 2018 for example. These are different developments completely, but should be discussed if this is an important aspect of the proposed method. Simiarly, graph Laplacians have been used to regularize registration in the models mentioned above (e.g. miccai 2018), as well as several classical models (e.g. in diffeomorphisms) but this is not mentioned or cited.

While it may be reasonable for computing (potentially multi-scale) optical flow between consecutive video frames, this condition seems unjustified for the sorts of deformations expected in intra-subject registration (e.g. Fig. 3)---even assuming feature brightness consistency. If this linearisation approach is in fact ""widely used"" in this context, please cite the relevant references backing the claim.\n\n- Otherwise, is the approximation applied iteratively as the moving image is deformed and resampled with small incremental displacements? If this is the case instead, I strongly suggest the authors clarify Section 2.1.\n\n- What is Delta(u,v)? Although it is a crucial element of the proposed pipeline, the actual output of the B-Spline Descent module is never properly defined. The paper could greatly benefit from a clear algorithmic description of all the steps involved.\n\n- What is the dimensionality of the feature maps fed into B-Spline Descent (M and F, and also the corresponding SDMs)? If it is greater than one, the equations as they are written are incorrect (see next point). The exposition can be made much clearer by defining the dimensions of all the variables.\n\n- Improper mathematical notation: x is undefined; some terms are missing x as an argument; unconventional partial derivative notation; missing energy summation over the coordinates (and feature dimensions?). I also suggest the authors switch to matrix notation for a clearer and more general formulation.\n\n- Careful with claims of ""disentanglement"", as it can lead to mischaracterisation of the present contribution. The authors can say the pipeline *decouples* a feature learning step from a deformation estimation step, but this is not a representation learning method (nothing wrong with that), so I\'d also be wary of relating it to Shu et al. (2018), for example.\n\n==== Evaluation ====\n- The dataset description needs more information. How many distinct subjects are there and how many scans of each? Are the scans paired across modalities?

Is it rigid/affine or deformable? What is used as the alignment target?\n\n- Especially with such small sample size, the averages in Table 1 mean very little without error estimates.

Even though pruning removes significant amount of weights in a network, memory requirement reduction was limited since conventional sparse matrix formats require significant amount of memory to store index-related information. Moreover, computations associated with such sparse matrix formats are slow because sequential sparse matrix decoding process does not utilize highly parallel computing systems efficiently. As an attempt to compress index information while keeping the decoding process parallelizable, Viterbi-based pruning was suggested. Decoding non-zero weights, however, is still sequential in Viterbi-based pruning. In this paper, we propose a new sparse matrix format in order to enable a highly parallel decoding process of the entire sparse matrix. The proposed sparse matrix is constructed by combining pruning and weight quantization. For the latest RNN models on PTB and WikiText-2 corpus, LSTM parameter storage requirement is compressed 19x using the proposed sparse matrix format compared to the baseline model.

The process includes (1) extraction of relevant sentences, (2) simplification/decomposition of complex sentences into simpler ones, (3) semantic role detection (""ARFs""), and (4) conversion to animated scenes. The most involved step is the simplification process, which uses several syntax-based rules tailored toward screenplay sentences. The paper also presents a dataset of ~ 1000 sentences annotated with multiple simplication and semantic roles.\n\n== Pros ==\n- The task of generating animation from text is an interesting one. While this is not a new task, it extends the capabiity of the original system (CARDINAL) to handle complex sentences.\n- The simplification method is described in detail and looks useful for information extraction in other domains.\n- The evaluation set will be useful for other researchers on information extraction and semantic role detection of complex sentences.\n\n== Cons ==\n- The major weakness of this paper is that it lacks quantitative and qualitative comparison with previous methods. The paper claims that previous sentence simplification methods do not work well, but it would be much more convincing to compare those systems with the one proposed in the paper. Otherwise it is unclear if the proposed method works better and should be adopted. The same goes for other modules such as the script parser.\n- If my understanding is correct, the simplification method drops timing information (e.g., ""X before Y"" and ""X after Y"" are both simplified as X + Y), which can be crucial for generating animations.\n- The evaluation on semantic roles (ARFs) is the most trustable one and should be more standardized. Currently the scores are affected by issues such as annotation inconsistencies and ambiguous answers (e.g., annotators write short answers for the object field, which penalizes systems that produce the more complete mentions).\n\n== Neutral ==\n- The BLEU score evaluation is not that great, but it is probably the best we have for evaluating sentence simplification.\n- The extrinsic evaluation is greatly affected by the incompleteness of the animation module, but can be fixed by adding more features to the animation module.', 'rating': '6: Marginally above acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		Hkg5zW96p7	rkgl6DrsWN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper36/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper36/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	Hkg5zW96p7	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper36/AnonReviewer3']	1546504119546		1548832397217	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

We propose a framework to encode the graph structure within the data. In some applications where the graph structure is evident, such as social network and visual layout, it can be easily modeled within our framework. In traditional textual IE tasks such as NER, we suggest that many correlations could help, for instance coreference. In our paper, we use a very simple graph structure, that is we simply connect identical words to support tagging consistency. The experiment results show that even such a simple structure helps to achieve better results. We are currently investigating a more general setting, in which the model starts from a fully-connected graph and learns the importance of the edges. The framework described in this paper should be seen as the infrastructure for future work.  Finally, although coreference resolution is a hard task, it does not depend on NER and it has already achieved good performance [1,2]. If such information is available, we believe it is beneficial to incorporate it and our framework is a principled way to do that.\n\nIn footnote 10, we agree that the claim is not very accurate and we have clarified it in the revised version. \n\nIn footnote 5, feature engineering method precomputes the features beforehand. The computation of the features is also time-consuming, but only needs to be done once. On the other hand, our neural model learns the text representation through LSTM.

We appreciate the opportunity to respond to your remarks.\n\nRegarding the difference between points (1) and (2), in the first point, we refer to the distribution of the instances for each relation type in the KGs, such as Wikidata and DBpedia. In fact, the distantly supervised datasets built using those KGs are usually unbalanced. The second point refers to domains where the training sets for RE have to be manually curated. In this case, collecting enough relation examples to train a standard neural-based RE classifier requires a considerable effort. Those points motivate our work.\n\nThe comparison of our one-shot technique with the zero-shot RE through querification by (Levy et al., 2017) as well as with USchema is a very interesting idea which deserves more investigations. We agree on this point.\xa0\n\nCurrently, the HSN does not differentiate between entity and non-entity tokens. As we pointed out in Section 6, we are trying to differentiate them using placeholders for the entities.\n\nWe added the work by (Liu, 2017) as related work in the new version. Thank you for this suggestion.\n\nWe think of the context vector as a way to help the attention mechanism give higher weights to those words in the mentions which better express a specific relation. For this reason, we use it at the word level. We already tried it at the relation level as you suggested, but without substantial improvements. Anyway, we understand your remark and we would like to deeply investigate this aspect.\n\nThank you for raising the interesting question about the possible overlaps of the relation instances across the three datasets. For the one-shot experiment, as we point out in the 'One-shot trials' paragraph of Section 5.3, we randomly choose 20 entity-pairs from the long-tailed relation types for each dataset in order to prevent the overlap. Our inspection did not reveal overlaps. We did not perform this analysis when we used the pre-trained analogy embeddings for the standard RE task. However, there are 3 reasons we believe this might not impact our results: (1) During training of the analogy model, we choose only a few entity-pairs for each relation type in T-REX, and then we compute all combinations amongst them. Thus, the probability of overlapping with the test sets of NYT-FB and CC-DBP is very low. (2) Even if some entity-pairs during training might occur in the two test sets, they are highly likely to have different textual mentions since the corpora are different among the datasets. So, the inputs would not overlap in this case. (3) The analogy embeddings are trained differently than standard neural-based RE embeddings, such as PCNN-KI. Despite these points, we plan to perform a detailed analysis w.r.t. this point and, eventually, re-run the evaluation after filtering any duplicate entity-pairs to address your concern.\xa0""}"		SkxE1b56TQ	Hkey-SjC7V	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper14/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper14/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	4		['everyone']	BkxdvJNmzE	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper14/Authors']	1548821751132		1548821751132	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper14/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task specification problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill.

""\n\nWe followed the intuition that a relation is defined by the two entities taking part in it and additional context with it. We wanted to model that as literally as possible and therefore used the words as queries to pick up additional information. \n\n""- That would mean that relation-specific information is encoded in the entity names already. In fact, this might be the case for ELMo embeddings since they are context dependent but would not work with other embeddings, especially when an entity is rare and has not been mentioned in the context of a specific relation in the training dataset for the embeddings. This is basically the result the authors get when they compare ELMo embeddings + attention only with GloVe embeddings + attention only on the SemEval dataset. However, entities in SemEval are nominal phrases which might actually be very indicative of their possible relations already.""\n\nThis is all correct (and we included an ablation study for both datasets where we just concatenated the two entities and directly classified on them)\n\n\n""I would expect an even more severe drop in performance for the TACRED dataset which includes persons, organizations and locations as entities. Just the name of a person, for example, does not indicate all possible relations it could participate in. Thus, it would be good if the authors evaluated GloVe + attention only on TACRED as well. In this setting, I would expect that the impact of the position encodings and the named entity embeddings increases a lot and would be much higher than the impact of the actual entity embeddings.""\n\nThis is correct too. We ommited the ""GloVe + TACRED"" because we have a rather large OOV ratio while looking up the entities and then we would  often just query with the UNKNOWN token + NE types and this does not work well.\n\n""- Another side note on interpretability: ELMo is a bidirectional RNN model, thus the authors actually use a bidirectional RNN + attention, which is not easier interpretable than other neural networks with attention (since the authors only analyze the attention weights but not the embeddings from the bidirectional RNN model) or even CNNs without attention (from which it is also possible to extract the pooling results).""\n\nWe agree and have withdrawn the claim about interpretability.\n\n""- (2) engineering: The paper does not include any technical contribution. Instead, it seems to be the result of a lot of engineering effort, such as reducing the transformer architecture to something that worked for them, adding and tuning a lot of different regularization techniques, adding named entity information to one of their datasets (without an ablation study), adding class weights also to only one of their datasets (without an ablation study), etc.""\n\nWe agree partly and have let go of some regularization techniques in the resubmission and reran the experiments. We think we give a good intuition why we reduced the transformer architecture to what we use eventually in section 3.3. We have included some more ablation studies for the NE information and class weights and tried to make more clear why we introduced them.\n\n""- Moreover, it is not clear how the authors tune the hyperparameters (listed in the appendix) on the SemEval dataset since they mention that they do not use a development set.""\n\nWe evaluated the model in the very end 5 times on the testset and report the median of these 5 runs. We tuned hyperparameters on a dev set (which we sampled from the training set)\n\n""- Are the relative positions in Equation 2 fed into an embedding layer? If not, this means that these values can get very large for long contexts which might affect the neural network negatively.""\n\nThey get fed into an embedding layer which returns the parameter-free positional embeddings (equation 1).

Some mistakes are observed in the current version.\n\nDetailed comments:\nIn this paper, the authors addressed the bottleneck in extraction of structured synthesis representations from text by introducing a dataset of 230 annotated synthesis procedures. A matrix-completion-based model was proposed for unlabeled edge placement, which was trained on a weakly supervised dataset. Experiment results showed that the proposed model outperforms a heuristic baseline in precision and F1. The paper is well-organized and generally easy to follow.\n\nThis paper, however, also has some disadvantages:\n1) Terminology needs to be consistent throughout the whole paper; for instance, inorganic materials synthesis vs. inorganic material synthesis, operation $r$ vs. trigger $r$. \n\n2) Experiments could be improved; in particular, the proposed model needs to be compared with state-of-the-art methods if other works on this task exist. What’s more, it would better if the exhaustive search for edge placements was compared with other alternatives through experiments; for example, argument candidates can be all arguments between one triger and the triger which has two steps from it.\n\n3) It is better to provide more detailed experimental analysis. It is of interest to see why the additional entity type information for the arguments does not boost the performance in edge placement? It would better to clarify why additional entity type information does no help for the task in the experimental analysis because it is not easy to find the reason for readers.\n\n4) In experiments, the proposed method was only compared with mere one baseline. Is it possible to compare with the work of Peng et al. [2017] to which the proposed is closed? If not, it would be apprecaited if the authors can explain the reason why the closest work is not stuitable for this task. \n\n5) The positioning of the paper is somewhat unclear to me.

In many cases, it is possible to decompose a task to a series of functions, of which for some we may prefer to use a neural network to learn the functionality, while for others the preferred method would be to use existing black-box functions. We propose a method for end-to-end training of a base neural network that integrates calls to existing black-box functions. We do so by approximating the black-box functionality with a differentiable neural network in a way that drives the base network to comply with the black-box function interface during the end-to-end optimization process. At inference time, we replace the differentiable estimator with its external black-box non-differentiable counterpart such that the base network output matches the input arguments of the black-box function. Using this ``Estimate and Replace'' paradigm, we train a neural network, end to end, to compute the input to black-box functionality while eliminating the need for intermediate labels.

The goal of the project is to create a huge and well-structured knowledge base to be used in NLP applications, such as QA, Dialogue systems and explainable NLP systems. It is created based on a scheme of ”Resource by Collaborative Contribution (RbCC)”. We conducted a shared task of structuring Wikipedia, and at the same, submitted results are used to construct a knowledge base.\nThere are machine readable knowledge bases such as CYC, DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase Wikidata and so on, but each of them has problems to be solved. CYC has a coverage problem, and others have a coherence problem due to the fact that these are based on Wikipedia and/or created by many but inherently incoherent crowd workers. In order to solve the later problem, we started a project for structuring Wikipedia using automatic knowledge base construction shared-task.\nThe automatic knowledge base construction shared-tasks have been popular and well studied for decades. However, these tasks are designed only to compare the performances of different systems, and to find which system ranks the best on limited test data. The results of the participated systems are not shared and the systems may be abandoned once the task is over.\nWe believe this situation can be improved by the following changes:\n1. designing the shared-task to construct knowledge base rather than evaluating only limited test data\n2. making the outputs of all the systems open to public so that we can run ensemble learning to create the better results than the best systems\n3. repeating the task so that we can run the task with the larger and better training data from the output of the previous task (bootstrapping and active learning)\nWe conducted “SHINRA2018” with the above mentioned scheme and in this paper\nwe report the results and the future directions of the project. The task is to extract the values of the pre-defined attributes from Wikipedia pages. We have categorized most of the entities in Japanese Wikipedia (namely 730 thousand entities) into the 200 ENE categories. Based on this data, the shared-task is to extract the values of the attributes from Wikipedia pages. We gave out the 600 training data and the participants are required to submit the attribute-values for all remaining entities of the same category type. Then 100 data out of them for each category are used to evaluate the system output in the shared-task.\nWe conducted a preliminary ensemble learning on the outputs and found 15 F1 score improvement on a category and the average of 8 F1 score improvements on all 5 categories we tested over a strong baseline. Based on this promising results, we decided to conduct three tasks in 2019; multi-lingual categorization task (ML), extraction for the same 5 categories in Japanese with a larger training data (JP-5) and extraction for 34 new categories in Japanese (JP-34).\n', 'archival status': 'Non-Archival', 'subject areas': ['Natural Language Processing', 'Information Extraction', 'Information Integration', 'Crowd-sourcing', 'Other'], 'pdf': '/pdf/74ce96da13d51a0e9df1df1b17131b8b9444fd90.pdf', 'paperhash': 'anonymous|shinra_structuring_wikipedia_by_collaborative_contribution', 'TL;DR': 'We introduce a ""Resource by Collaborative Construction"" scheme to create KB, structured Wikipedia ', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019shinra:,    \ntitle={SHINRA: Structuring Wikipedia by Collaborative Contribution},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \nbooktitle={Submitted to Automated Knowledge Base Construction},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HygfXWqTpm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}'}"		HygfXWqTpm	HygfXWqTpm	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	38	rkxJXtVpa7	['everyone']		['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']	1542459674310		1548732058547	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

End-to-end training should be considered instead of taking a pretrained feature extractor that doesn't work for this task, or at the very least other models for visual feature extraction should have been tried.

The summation is over the observed triples (<s, r, o>) in the training data. As a result, based on the definition of the Y_o^{s,r}, the zero values of Y_o^{s,r} represent the negative samples. In the revised version of the paper, we add more details to loss function to provide a more precise definition.\n\n- D2. “The optimization problems”\n\nWe agree that we could define the optimization problem as  $\\argmin \\bar \\psi(s,r,o)$, but that is identical to $\\argmax \\psi(s,r,o) - \\bar \\psi(s,r,o)$, since \\psi(s,r,o) is a constant for the search.

As a result, our networks achieve more than 90% accuracy demonstrating their capability in correctly inverting the vector z_{s,r} to {s,r}. Furthermore, although we could use maximum inner-product search for DistMult, we were looking for a general algorithm which would work across multiple models. We elaborate this issue in the revised version.   \n\n- D8. “The effect of normalization”\n\nWe did not consider the effect of normalization in our approximations, because a recent implementation [1] found it unnecessary.

We can include the details in the appendix if the reviewer feels that will be valuable.\n\n- D9. “The description of the experimental setup”\n\nFor training the link prediction task, we adopt the implementation and hyperparameters from [1]. To retrain the models, we simply alter the training data and do the training process from scratch with the same hyperparameters. In section 4.2, to find the optimum z_{s’, r’} we use a gradient-based method which we found its optimum step size through a grid search.

Since the approaches make different approximations, the rankings are different. The targets are triples randomly selected from the data and we average the result by choosing 10 random target samples. It is intractable to evaluate all triples as potential adversaries even for these small KBs, since we would have to retrain the model for every triple. We added more details for this section in the revised version.\n\n- D13. “The discussion in the experimental study and the reason behind better performance of attacks on some relations”\n\nIt is difficult to conjecture precisely why some relations are more robust, and we hope these results will seed future research in this direction. We have revised the text for the experiments in the current version of the paper to be more clear.\n\n- D14. “How much interpretability we can get from attacks”\n\nInterpretability comes primarily from the removal, which aids our understanding by identifying the observed fact that has the **most influence** on the model for predicting a specific target. Note that the adversaries that are uninsightful/unintuitive does not mean the approach is not useful for interpretability, but might indicate a problem with the model or the dataset.\n  \n- D15. “How rules have been extracted”\n\nWe provide a more detailed explanation of our rule extraction method and compare the extracted rules with an existing method for the rule extraction [2] in the revised version.\n\n- D16. “Error detection experiment”\n\nIn our setting, we assume that the target triples that have an error in their neighborhood are given. We can make the error detection fully automatic by setting a threshold (or even learn this threshold) on the value of $\\Delta_{(s\',r\')}(s,r,o)$ (defined in the revised version) and choose the triples whose removal causes a change less than this threshold as our errors.\n\n- D17. “The relationship to [Minervini et al., 2017, Cai and Wang, 2017]”\n\nThe authors in [Minervini et al., 2017] consider an adversarial training using some predefined rules to provide a more accurate representation of KBs.

In the revised paper, we address the concerns and suggestions to strengthen our paper. We hope reviewers revisit the rating in light of our revision and response. The following summarizes our changes. \n\n1) Inverter function accuracy: To study the accuracy of our inverter functions we evaluate the performance of our networks on the test set of our benchmarks. Our networks achieve more than 90% accuracy demonstrating their capability in correctly inverting the vector z_{s,r} to {s,r}. Details are provided in the revised paper (see Table 1).\n\n2) Scalability test: To better evaluate the performance of AALP (in the revised version we rename the method to AMLP) with influence function (IF), we compare the time to compute a single adversary by IF to AALP, as we steadily grow the number of entities (randomly chosen subgraphs), averaged over 10 random triples. Based on this experiment, we showed that AALP is mostly unaffected by the number of entities while IF increases quadratically. Considering that real-world KGs have tens of thousands of times more entities than our setting, we demonstrate that IF is infeasible for them (see Figure 4).\n\n3) New alternative for our method as AALP-flip: Using  AALP method, we introduce a new alternative that increases the score of a fake fact, i.e., we identify the adversary that would increase the prediction for a fake fact. We study the effect of this new adversarial attack in Table 3.\n\n4) New baseline for AALP-Remove: We consider a new baseline for AALP-Remove by removing the neighbor where f(s\',r\') is closest to f(s,r) and demonstrate its behavior in Table 3.\n\n5) More on rule extraction: We provide a more detailed explanation of our rule extraction method and compare the extracted rules with an existing method for the rule extraction [1] in the revised version.\n\n\nMore details: We add more detailed explanations for our problem setup and experiments and provide a more detailed discussion on the behavior of the models in each experiment.

Using these attacks, we are able to identify the most influential related fact for a predicted link and investigate the sensitivity of the model to additional made-up facts. We introduce an efficient approach to estimate the effect of making a change by approximating the change in the embeddings upon altering the knowledge graph. In order to avoid the combinatorial search over all possible facts, we introduce an inverter function and gradient-based search to identify the adversary in a continuous space. We demonstrate that our models effectively attack the link prediction models by reducing their accuracy between 6-45% for different metrics.

A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all the six state-of-the-art pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or even worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are consistent for a wide variety of pruning algorithms with multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks. Our results have several implications: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is not necessary to obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned ""important"" weights of the large model are not necessarily useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited ""important"" weights, is what leads to the efficiency benefit in the final model, which suggests that some pruning algorithms could be seen as performing network architecture search; we further show that it is possible to use the sparsity patterns from the pruned network to design efficient models.', 'paperhash': 'liu|rethinking_the_value_of_network_pruning', 'TL;DR': 'In network pruning, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable performance than training it from scratch.', 'authorids': ['zhuangl@berkeley.edu', 'sunmj15@gmail.com', 'tinghuiz@eecs.berkeley.edu', 'gaohuang.thu@gmail.com', 'trevor@eecs.berkeley.edu'], 'authors': ['Zhuang Liu', 'Mingjie Sun', 'Tinghui Zhou', 'Gao Huang', 'Trevor Darrell'], 'keywords': ['network pruning', 'network compression', 'architecture search', 'train from scratch'], 'pdf': '/pdf/03f3f0026332ab402a010c8078ac4eb5b361ab7a.pdf', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\nliu2018rethinking,\ntitle={Rethinking the Value of Network Pruning},\nauthor={Zhuang Liu and Mingjie Sun and Tinghui Zhou and Gao Huang and Trevor Darrell},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJlnB3C5Ym},\n}'}"		rJlnB3C5Ym	rJlnB3C5Ym	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	1580	SygFAapcYX	['everyone']		['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']	1538088004145		1548655786969	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

Specifically, we design trunk branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask branches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with mixed attentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with convolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about long-range dependencies in the whole feature map.

Therefore it’s hard to get a probability distribution over all targets serving as a base score, like PCNN+ATT. \n\n“I believe the authors are unaware of the work…”\nIn the revised version we add some discussion of the mentioned related works. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03401.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08854.pdf learn the embedding of word pairs based on their context words, which is not the textual relation (shortest dependency path) between them. \n\n“I also found the loss function a bit weird….why not use it as the target?”\nThis is due to the wrong labeling problem of distant supervision, the reason why we employ global co-occurrence statistics as supervision signal. The true relation each instance refers to cannot be always told by distant supervision, because there may be multiple relations between an entity pair, while at most one relation is truly expressed in an instance. Also sometimes the entity pair just appears together and refers to no relation. Distant supervision maps all the KB relations to each instance, thus results some wrong labels. See figure 2 for an example of wrong labeling problem and how to combat with global co-occurrence statistics. \n\n“- What is the difference from Su et al., 2017?...”\nTo show a clear ablation, in the revised version we denote the embedding trained with RNN as GloRE+, standing for new data; the embedding trained with Transformer as GloRE++, standing for both new data and different model.

The main contribution of this work is the aligned large-scale dataset and the textual relation embedding learned through global co-occurrence, which we believe can facilitate the research on relational understanding tasks. \n\n“(-) Even after training on the large corpus, the model only performs comparably…”\nOn the NYT dataset, models augmented with textual relation embedding show an improvement on manual evaluation results, the precision of predictions with top confidence, which is considered more precise than automatic evaluation under distant supervision setting. The usage of the learned textual relation embedding is two-folded: 1. Serving as an additional feature to provide complementary information on downstream tasks, like relation extraction on NYT. 2. Alleviating the need of designing task-specific textual relation models. On FB15k-237, we replace the original neural network with the learned embedding followed by one simple feed-forward layer.

527	1548635657364	"{'title': 'Response', 'comment': '\n>>> I believe there are a few other issues not adequately highlighted in the reviews that prevent this work from being accepted:\n\nResponse: We would like to thank the AC for taking the time to post the meta-review.  Unfortunately, the major concerns are simply not correct.  Below we address the points raised:\n\n>>> [premises] It has not been adequately established that ""large batch training often times leads to degradation in accuracy"" inherently which is an important premise of this work. \n\nResponse: That is incorrect. Multiple (if not tens) of works have shown that large batch size leads to significant degradation of accuracy (arxiv: 1609.04836, 1802.08241, 1706.02677,1811.12941, 1811.03600, etc). This is a well established phenomena and it is surprising that the area chair brings this point. Even the papers that the AC cites do clearly mention this.\n\n>>>Even the framing of this issue has become confused since, although it may be possible to achieve the same accuracy at any batch size with careful tuning, this might require using (at worst) the same number of steps as the smaller batch size in some cases and thus result in little to no speedup. For example see https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08741 and recent work in https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600 for more information.\n\nResponse: This is incorrect. Large batch does not “at worst” need the same number of steps as smaller batch to achieve the same accuracy. It is not clear to us why the AC would even claim this. Large batch training may not be able to recover baseline if a vanilla SGD is used even with longer training (arxiv:1811.03600 Figure 23).\n\n>>> Even Keskar et al. reported that data augmentation eliminated the solution quality difference between their larger batch size and their smaller batch size experiments which indicates that even if noisiness from small batches serving to regularize training other regularization techniques can serve just as well.\n\nResponse: This is completely incorrect and a misunderstanding of Keskar’s paper by the AC. Keskar’s paper (arxiv: 1609.04836) showed that data augmentation can partially alleviate the generation gap between small and large batch training, and it is not possible to completely close this gap with data-augmentation. \n\n>>> [baseline strength] The appropriate baseline is standard minibatch SGD w/momentum (or ADAM or whatever) algorithm with extremely careful tuning of *all* of the hyperparameters. None of the popular learning rate heuristics will always work and other optimization parameters need to be tuned as well. If learning rate decay is used, it should also be tuned especially if one is trying to measure a speedup. The submission does not provide a sufficiently convincing baseline.\n\nResponse: This is not applicable to our work. We do NOT do any hyper-parameter tuning, and we emphasized this in multiple places in the paper. This was one of the main points of the paper, and it is very disappointing that it has been missed. Moreover, we did not change any hyper-parameters for the baseline neural networks that we used.\n\n>>> [measurement protocol] The protocol for measuring a speedup is not convincing without more information on how the baselines were tuned to achieve the same accuracy in the fewest steps. Approximating the protocols in https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600 would be one alternative.\n\nResponse: Please see above, we did not tune any hyper-parameters.\n\n\n\nAlso we should mention that Reviewer 1 is pointing to our own code in his review as a reason that our Hessian backpropogation is not novel.  That is, due to the double blind aspect of this publication venue, a reviewer incorrectly thought that our novel Hessian backpropogation procedure was due to someone else and thus not novel.   It was very frustrating for us that we could not clear this due to double blind review policy. Moreover, the reviewer completely missed the supplementary material (thus mentioning non-existent figures). We had hoped that he would at least read our response but unfortunately that did not happen. Combined with AC’s meta review it seems our paper’s points and efforts to clear up confusions were not helpful.\n\nAt the end, we would like to specially thank Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 for taking the time to follow up with our response, and providing their valuable feedback.\n'}"		H1lnJ2Rqt7	Hyg-zATimE	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1021/Official_Comment	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1021/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	13		['everyone']	HyxnRTvyx4	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1021/Authors']	1548635657364		1548635692391	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1021/Authors', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

In contrast, recent advances in 3D shape sensing focus more on low-level geometry but less on these higher-level relationships. In this paper, we propose 3D shape programs, integrating bottom-up recognition systems with top-down, symbolic program structure to capture both low-level geometry and high-level structural priors for 3D shapes. Because there are no annotations of shape programs for real shapes, we develop neural modules that not only learn to infer 3D shape programs from raw, unannotated shapes, but also to execute these programs for shape reconstruction. After initial bootstrapping, our end-to-end differentiable model learns 3D shape programs by reconstructing shapes in a self-supervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that our model accurately infers and executes 3D shape programs for highly complex shapes from various categories. It can also be integrated with an image-to-shape module to infer 3D shape programs directly from an RGB image, leading to 3D shape reconstructions that are both more accurate and more physically plausible.', 'keywords': ['Program Synthesis', '3D Shape Modeling', 'Self-supervised Learning'], 'authorids': ['yonglong@mit.edu', 'aluo@mit.edu', 'xs5@princeton.edu', 'ellisk@mit.edu', 'billf@mit.edu', 'jbt@mit.edu', 'jiajunwu@mit.edu'], 'authors': ['Yonglong Tian', 'Andrew Luo', 'Xingyuan Sun', 'Kevin Ellis', 'William T.

By using a neural inference network to approximate the model\'s posterior on latent variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as ""posterior collapse"" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate the model\'s true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse occurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model\'s current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work.

The algorithm covers 82.47% of all the problems in the dataset.  Furthermore, we show how the overall approach generalizes on a well known pronoun resolution corpus which is inspired from the Winograd Schema Challenge.', 'pdf': '/pdf/6e1483dc58e2a0002536ee933305a50b084e9257.pdf', 'archival status': 'Non-Archival', 'subject areas': ['Question Answering', 'Reasoning', 'Knowledge Representation'], 'paperhash': 'anonymous|commonsense_knowledge_types_identification_andreasoning_for_the_winograd_schema_challenge', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019commonsense,    \ntitle={Commonsense Knowledge Types Identification andReasoning for the Winograd Schema Challenge},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \nbooktitle={Submitted to Automated Knowledge Base Construction},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1gyNZ9Tam},    \nnote={under review}    \n}'}		r1gyNZ9Tam	r1gyNZ9Tam	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	43	S1gqeEHpa7	['everyone']		['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']	1542459687384		1548558483303	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Please find our reply to your concern about the manual knowledge extraction and the future extension of contributions of our work.\n\n1. The knowledge types identified in this work are useful in developing a large knowledge base. There are two prominent approaches for developing such a knowledge base. First is the automatic extraction of the knowledge from text. An example of such an extraction is as mentioned in the section 4.3.1 of the paper. Second and currently more popular approach is the use of crowd-sourcing. A recent example of such an effort is as shown in the ATOMIC knowledge base (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/atomic/). One of the common requirement of both of these approaches is the ""kind"" of knowledge that is being extracted. It helps in the development of knowledge specific extraction algorithm in case of automatic extraction from text and in the development of the knowledge type specific setups provided to crowd workers in case of crowd-sourcing.\n\n2. The current analysis on identifying the knowledge types can be extended to create a comprehensive list of knowledge types by analyzing other problems to identify the knowledge types.

The main idea behind the merging operation in the reasoning algorithm is to generate a new representation such that it contains the information present in the representation of an input text and it also contains the additional information present in the representation of the input knowledge. Though the idea of merging is general and applies to any given text and knowledge, let us take a look at an example with respect to the Winograd Schema Challenge. \n\nLet S be a WSC sentence such that S = ""Jim yelled at Kevin because he was so upset."", and K be a knowledge such that K = ""x is upset causes x yells"". It can be observed from the knowledge that the person who ""yells"" is also the person who is upset. Using this new information in the knowledge, we can update the sentence and create a new sentence S\' as:\nS\' =  ""Jim,he yelled at Kevin because Jim,he were upset""\nHere, all the information that is present in the input sentence is preserved as is and the information from the knowledge is also added.\n\nThe merging operation in the reasoning algorithm performs the above mentioned update on the input sentence and generates a new merged representation corresponding to the new sentence as mentioned above. A set of logical operations were performed with respect to the input representations to get the merged representation. These operations are as explained in the description of the algorithm in the paper. \n\nNow, one would think that just replacing ""he"" with ""Jim"" in the original sentence above would be enough to solve the problem which would generate the new sentence S\' = ""Jim yelled at Kevin because Jim were upset."". Although that is true with respect to the problems in the WSC challenge corpus, in this work we developed a general algorithm which handles more kinds of question answering problems than just pronoun resolution problems. An example is as shown below.\n\nLet S be a sentence such that S = ""Donald Trump yelled at Rudy Giuliani because the president was upset with Rudy."". Given the sentence S and the knowledge ""x is upset causes x yells"", one could ask questions such as Q1 = ""Who was the president upset with?"", Q2 = ""Who was Donald Trump upset with?"", Q3 = ""Who was upset?"". Now, if we go with our approach of creating a new sentence by merging the knowledge and the sentence, the new sentence S\' becomes ""Donald Trump,the president yelled at Rudy Giuliani because Donald Trump,the president was upset with Rudy."". All the above given questions can be easily answered by using the new sentence S\'. On the other hand, if the new sentence is created by replacing one of the entities with the other then following two cases emerge:\n\nCase1: S\' = ""Donald Trump yelled at Rudy Giuliani because Donald Trump was upset with Rudy.""\nCase2: S\' = ""the president yelled at Rudy Giuliani because the president was upset with Rudy.""\n\nEach of the cases mentioned above are insufficient (just by itself) in answering all the questions mentioned above. Case 1 can not be used to answer Q1 and Q3 (in its entirety) and Case 2 can not be used to answer Q2 and Q3 (in its entirety).\n\nWe have also updated the paper to include the above mentioned basic idea behind merging so that the algorithm is more comprehensible.\n\n2. In section 4.2.2, we mean that each problem in the original WSC dataset of 291 problems falls into one of the 12 categories of knowledge. In other words, each of the problems in 291 WSC problems can be solved by using a knowledge of either one of the types in 1 through 12.'}"		r1gyNZ9Tam	rkeLMgj5Q4	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper43/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	ryxFxMlEGE	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Authors']	1548558350391		1548558350391	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

We presented a reasoning algorithm to handle 10 kinds out of 12 knowledge types identified in this work. One of the motivations behind the identification of the categories of knowledge was that different knowledge kinds may require different kinds of reasoning. Continuing on the motivation, in this work we progress by focusing on one reasoning approach which covers the knowledge kinds that cover a majority of examples in the WSC challenge and a similar corpora i.e., 82.5% in the WSC corpus and 69% in the DPR corpus. It is because of the ‘sentence1 predicate sentence2’ structure that a single reasoning algorithm was able to handle 10 kinds of knowledge. We realized that the remaining two kinds can not be handled in a similar reasoning approach. We are currently working on defining the reasoning paradigms for the remaining two categories of knowledge. Since the submission of this paper we are working on an idea to reason with the types 11 and 12 knowledge i.e., more likely statement and multiple knowledge pieces. We are currently in the process of formally defining the ideas and testing them on the real WSC dataset. The gist of the idea for handling the ""more likely"" knowledge is to use a Natural Language Inference model for ""more likely"" knowledge. There the statement that is more likely is assumed to be entailed (with greater entailment score as compared to the other statement) by the original WSC sentence when the pronoun to be resolved in it is replaced by the correct answer to the problem. Whereas the idea to handle multiple knowledge pieced is to process one knowledge piece at a time until all the knowledge pieces are processed.\n\nTo evaluate if the identified kinds are actually meaningful, we examined if the identified knowledge types can be used in another similar dataset i.e., DPR. The results show that they are actually useful. We also agree that it will be very useful to preform a comprehensive categorization of the required knowledge to cover many different datasets (of same or different kinds). To that end, in this work we started by analyzing one such corpus. We believe that this work would promote research in the direction of identifying different knowledge types and in the future we or someone else could analyze more corpora to identify new categories if needed.\n\n2. In our work we defined a representation for a sentence (Definition 1 in the paper), a question (Definition 2 in the paper) and a piece of knowledge (Definition 3 in the paper). The representations are used as inputs to the logical reasoning algorithm which outputs the answers to a winograd schema question through a series of logical operations. To evaluate the overall reasoning algorithm we used K-Parser just as a tool for generating the representations of a sentence, a question and a piece of knowledge. As mentioned in the section 4.3 of the paper we transformed the output of K-Parser according to the definitions 1, 2 and 3 so that they can be utilized by our reasoning algorithm. We used K-Parser because it was an easily available semantic parser and its representation was very similar to the representation defined in our work. That being said, any semantic parser which produces a semantic representation that can be automatically transformed into the representation defined in our work can be used in place of K-Parser. Although the K-Parser is not error-free we found it advantageous because as described in the K-Parser description (http://bioai8core.fulton.asu.edu/kparser/about.jsp), it is a pipeline of various NLP tools and hence it is possible to improve parts of it to remove/reduce the overall parsing errors. For example, the 18.1% parsing errors found in the DPR corpus were caused because of the incorrect part-of-speech tagging (7.2%) and the incorrect dependency parsing (10.9%). So, improving those systems in the K-Parser could be helpful in removing the errors caused by them. We made a note of such errors and notified the authors of K-Parser for further improvement of the parser.'}"		r1gyNZ9Tam	B1gPJki5XV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper43/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	rJeKV9DNMV	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Authors']	1548558046872		1548558046872	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

In this paper, we propose a novel regularized transfer learning framework DELTA, namely DEep Learning Transfer using Feature Map with Attention. Instead of constraining the weights of neural network, DELTA aims to preserve the outer layer outputs of the target network. Specifically, in addition to minimizing the empirical loss, DELTA intends to align the outer layer outputs of two networks, through constraining a subset of feature maps that are precisely selected by attention that has been learned in an supervised learning manner.

One of our long term goals is to compare our method against similar and state of the art methods. However, this is not straightforward and for this deadline we were not able to acquire either the code implementations or the datasets used for relevant published methods. Re-implementing established methods was the only possible choice but we did not have enough time to do so; this also creates a large amount of extra work. Our method is focused on news articles and other long-form text documents, so we did not want to compare against event detection methods (where we might have been able to get access to the datasets) focused on tweets. Twitter data and news media are sufficiently different that this comparison would be inappropriate. \n  \nFor these reasons we focused on evaluation against human analysts, as reported in the manuscript. Our method was able to detect all the major peaking events as well as events that were described by a very small number of articles. Therefore we are confident in the good performance of our approach. \n\nThe color of the nodes in figure 4 corresponds to the color of the entities in figures 2 and 3.

552	1548453295096	{'title': 'Comment on first reviewer.', 'comment': 'In our paper we create and process knowledge (articles) about named entities and their relations. We use natural language processing and machine learning methods to extract useful knowledge while our approach is efficient enough to be applied on a large-scale dataset. For that reason we believe that our paper is relevant to this conference.\n\nRegarding the event detection our method tracks the weighted node degree over time and detects change-points on them which correspond to an event. The detected communities are formed not only from entities but from the most informative noun phrases (Fig. 10) and they are used to describe the detected event. We should also point out that each keyword has a weight which further helps the user to understand what the event is about. Our approach is a Feature-pivot method where sets of terms that describe the occurring events are extracted from a corpus of documents. Such method is described in [Sayyadi et al., 2009] and a good description of event detection methods is given in [Aiello et al., 2013].\n\nWe chose the specific date (24/6/2016) to make it easier to the reader to understand our evaluation. Our method does not only detect and summarize the well known events, but also detects real events that are described by a very small number of articles (Table 1). For example the Hillary Clinton email scandal is mentioned only in 5 articles out of 300 in total for the current day, the west Virginia floods in 4, the EgyprAir plane crash is mentioned in 2 and so on. Our method is sensitive enough to detect such events and give an easy to use summary to the user.\n\nOur pipeline does not only combine out of the box tools, but further improve their results and introduces new ideas to process the input data. For example the weighting and the use of the nodes weighted degree further in our method, provides a very fast way to identify important entities without calculating the computationally expensive page rank metric. By using time series analysis we introduce a way to filter out “noisy” articles which can contribute misleading keywords to the new network (KeyGraph) and can also cause the merging of communities that describe different events. In the case of the NER classifier we improve its results (which are only single words classified as Persons, Organizations, Locations and Other) by introducing a disambiguation algorithm that replaces single names with the fool name of the entity. A lot of effort was also given in disambiguating Organization and Location entities such as USA, U.S.A, EU, European Union and so on.\n\nAs mentioned before we address the challenge of event detection in news streams, introducing a pipeline that can detect  peaking events and not just a summary of the topics discussed on the news. For the evaluation we manually annotated 1800 articles and our method was able to detect all of the major events, as well as the majority of the minor events. (described in less than 5 articles). \n\nWe understand that comparing our method against other state of the art methods would produce a good evaluation but that was not an easy task on the available time, for a number of reasons:\n    • First there is no benchmark dataset of news articles which can be used to compare our methods with others. \n    • Second we were not able to find implementations of other methods and on the given time we were not able to implement them by ourselves.\n    • Third our method detects peaking events on news articles, for that reason it is hard to compare it with methods that only summarise articles without detecting peaking events. \nLast although there are other methods for event detection their target input is tweets and comparing them with news articles as input would be misleading. We plan to make adjustments to our method to be able to process tweets as well, but this is for future work. \n\nThank you for you feedback.'}		HylqxZqppX	HklD2H-FQE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper23/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper23/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	SygIQQxmfN	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper23/Authors']	1548453295096		1548453295096	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper23/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Lower modules are a black box to the calling module, and communicate only via a query and an output.

Indeed we had a correspondence about this issue following a posting of a previous version of our paper on ArXiv. \n\nThe reviewer is referring to one particular result shown at the bottom of figure 1. Contrary to the title of the reviewer’s comment, he/she acknowledged in our correspondence that given the input frames shown in the bottom of figure 1, the output of the network that we show is reproducible and it varies drastically even between almost identical frames. \n\nThe issue that the reviewer is addressing is how to go from the YouTube video to the network input since the video has an aspect ratio very different from one. Indeed for this specific video, this “processing pipeline” makes a difference. However, and as we already mentioned in the correspondence, we easily found other YouTube videos of polar bears that give jagged predictions with the reviewer’s suggested pipeline.\n\nAs a result of the same correspondence, we added a footnote at the bottom of page 3 that explicitly says that different preprocessing pipelines give different results. \nImportantly, following the reviewer\'s comments, we verified that all the other results do not depend on the pipeline and all the graphs shown in the paper are with a pipeline that maintains the aspect ratio of the original image.\n\nThat being said, the question of ""the right pipeline"" is far from obvious. Using a center crop as suggested by the reviewer means that you will necessarily miss polar bears that do not appear in the center (an extreme case of taking advantage of photographer\'s bias). In fact, the default preprocessing suggested by Keras (https://keras.io/applications/)  prefers to reshape the full image (as we did in the bottom of figure 1) rather than to perform a center crop.\n\nFinally, we want to stress again that the three frames shown in the bottom of figure 1 are exactly the frames given to the network and given these frames anyone can reproduce our reported network output. The difference between these frames is a very small deformation that is imperceptible to humans and yet makes a huge difference to the output of the network.

While it\'s true that ""equations"" were discussed between Rev1 and the authors,  I do not believe our understanding of the paper was improved.\n\nThe only publicly visible discussion happened after the acceptance decision. The authors did not elect to address technical concerns of the reviewers before the AC decision, therefore the discussion the AC mentions could not affect the AC\'s decision. The AC claims that ""Nobody was ignored"", however, the reviewer comments were ignored by the authors (as far as I can tell from the public part of the discussion). \n\nThere was indeed a discussion between Rev1 and authors after the acceptance decision. if you follow the discussion, you will find out that in none of the comments Rev1 agrees with the authors, or the authors agree with any point raised by Rev1. The authors failed to defend their point, and withdrew from the discussion (the last comment is by Rev1). I, therefore, cannot follow the argument of AC that ""Detailed equations were discussed and improved our understanding of the paper.""\n\nThe AC is under the impression that ""All related work has been or will be added to a later paper version so having missed it in prior submission is now irrelevant. That\'s what this process is for.\nIf the authors still did not cite relevant work it would be bad."" Unfortunately, we have to accept that what is happening is, in fact, ""bad"". If you follow the discussion, the authors refuse to cite the recent relevant papers, instead stating that they will cite Venn, 1880 and Whitehead, 1929.  They add that ""If space available, we consider add one of the two references you mentions which appear in 2015 and 2017"", however, the submitted manuscript has not been revised once since submission.\n\nThe AC might reasonably state that the fact that the consensus was not reached does not imply rejection of the paper. However, the ICLR AC guidelines state that ""A key part of your role during the review period is to actively facilitate discussion among reviewers, with the aim of clarifying aspects of the papers’ claims, and other questions that have been raised, in fair and respectful ways."" It seems to me that it would be appropriate for the AC to moderate the discussion between Rev1 and the authors so that the truth can be found. If the AC chooses not to do so, the guidelines still instruct them to "" Discuss any major points of contention. As raised by the authors or reviewers in the discussion, and how these might have influenced the decision."" None of the AC\'s comments address or state what the reviewers concerns are and why they have been downweighted in the acceptance decision. I hope that AC chooses to engage in technical discussion (possibly with Rev1 or even the authors) to clarify this.\n\n', 'title': 'Lack of technical discussion by AC'}"		rJlWOj0qF7	B1lWLvKD7N	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper331/Public_Comment	[]	11		['everyone']	SklYX6QPXV	['(anonymous)']	1548355400847		1548355400847	['(anonymous)', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

Commonly used models represent mentions as sparse feature vectors which are iteratively agglomerated to form clusters of mentions. The feature vector of a cluster is a function of all the mentions in the cluster which causes them to become more dense over time and computationally expensive to operate over. To address this, the authors investigate hashing schemes to expedite similarity calculation. Importantly, they propose a homomorphic hash function that is able to update the representation of a cluster online as new mentions are added or removed. \n\n\n-pros\n — a homomorphic simhash that can speed up similarity calculations while maintaining performance\n — experiments  show that the hashing schema is able to perform within 1 F1 point of the exact similarity model. \n — good coverage of related work and explanation of methods\n\n-cons\n— only tested on a single dataset\n— the lines in Fig 2 are not the clearest presentation of the speed accuracy tradeoff due to the large differences in scales and the fact that the maximum accuracies are never reached for some lines.

In this work, we address the problem of learning an agent’s action space purely from visual observation. We use stochastic video prediction to learn a latent variable that captures the scene's dynamics while being minimally sensitive to the scene's static content. Standard techniques lead to reasonable predictions but fail to capture the structure of the action space, as they do not disentangle actions from static scene content. We introduce a loss term that encourages the network to capture the composability of visual sequences and show that it leads to representations that disentangle the structure of actions. We show the applicability of our method to synthetic settings and its potential to capture action spaces in complex, realistic visual settings.

These limitations make RNNs difficult to embed on mobile devices requiring real-time processes with limited hardware resources. To address the above issues, we introduce a method that can learn binary and ternary weights during the training phase to facilitate hardware implementations of RNNs. As a result, using this approach replaces all multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, bringing significant benefits to custom hardware in terms of silicon area and power consumption. On the software side, we evaluate the performance (in terms of accuracy) of our method using long short-term memories (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) on various sequential models including sequence classification and language modeling. We demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results on the aforementioned tasks while using binary/ternary weights during the runtime. On the hardware side, we present custom hardware for accelerating the recurrent computations of LSTMs with binary/ternary weights.

In our system, we employed several heuristics to order the actions contained in the same sentence during the sentence simplification stage, based on the timing information. We could not include these due to space constraints (we will describe it if the paper gets accepted). Each simplified sentence gets assigned with an incremental temporary ID, indicating the ordering. For example, in the Adverbial structure analyzer, the transform function will detect words with 'PREP' and 'MARK' tag, and modify the ordering according to a set of time indicators(e.g. [before, after, as, until, till, ...]). One example is: \n\nSuddenly there is a knock at the door, immediately after which Jim's mom enters. \n\nThe system will detect PREP 'which' and identifies the ordering of verbs. The outputs are: [('Jim's mom enters', 1), ('Suddenly there is a knock at the door', 0)], which means Jim's mom enters only after the knock. Similar heuristics are also applied in other sentence structure analyzers.\n3. We trained our annotators to be as consistent and objective as possible. However, annotation inconsistencies are due to subjectivity of the task and inherent ambiguities in natural language. Some of the fields being annotated are quite subjective and vary from person to person.

As per the call, we assume that AKBC is now not just limited to knowledge base construction only but also encourages wider scope such as NLP.  Nevertheless, as also noted by Reviewer 3, the linguistic text simplification techniques we describe are equally applicable for information extraction as is done in Open IE based systems. \n\nAs also as described in the paper, we are addressing an interesting research problem in a more practical setting where there is no training data available. \n\nSpecific Remarks:\n\n1. We used training data to develop linguistic rules for sentence simplification and later for extracting information. The labelled corpus we created is only for evaluation. Creating a corpus is very labor intensive and time intensive task making it difficult to create a reasonable-sized training corpus which could be used for training an end to end system. \n2. In this paper we are addressing a more practical setting where there is no training data available for training an end to end system. The methods proposed in this paper are NLP oriented but, as we mentioned in the paper, the linguistic simplification techniques will be useful for information extraction and knowledge base creation especially for free form texts, or for use cases with little labelled data. Our work comes close to the Graphene System (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11276.pdf) where the authors also propose using linguistic rules for simplifying text and for extracting information. \n3. Our paper does not include quantitative comparison between our system and existing systems. This is due to two reasons: Firstly, existing systems such as CONFUCIUS, SceneMaker and Cardinal do not provide any quantitative results. And secondly, there is no publicly available implementation of their work. Therefore, replicating their work is hard. Moreover, as stated in their original papers, they do not address sentences with complex structure, therefore it is difficult to compare against their work.\n4. Our main contribution in terms of  methodology is our set of linguistic simplification rules to simplify sentence structures and proposing a novel pipeline for text to animation system. As shown in the paper, these methods works well in practice. In terms of resource contribution, we have a created a gold test dataset for text to animation generation system. It is hoped that it will serve as a standard benchmark dataset for systems working on text to animation generation.

As per the call, we assume that AKBC is now not just limited to knowledge base construction only but also encourages wider scope such as NLP.  Nevertheless, as also noted by Reviewer 3, the linguistic text simplification techniques we describe are equally applicable for information extraction as is done in Open IE based systems. \n\nAs also as described in the paper, we are addressing an interesting research problem in a more practical setting where there is no training data available. \n\nSpecific Remarks:\n\n1. In principle we could we use an end to end IE system. In fact we even tried to do that in our initial attempts. However, in our initial experiments with Open IE system gave very poor results. The sentence structures occurring in our corpus are complicated and cannot be readily processed by an IE system as we saw in our initial experiments. In order to make the text amenable to an IE system we used a text simplification approach (Text simplification module in figure 1). We crafted a set of linguistic rules to simplify the sentences so that information could be easily extracted from these (IE module in figure 1). Moreover, the linguistic simplification techniques we developed would be useful for IE systems dealing with free-form texts like the screenplays. In our initial attempts at addressing the research problem, we thought of trying an end to end approach as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00421.pdf, however, we suffered from lack of a big domain-specific training corpus. Hence, we had to resort to learning an intermediate representation (ARF) which could be used by animation engine. \n2. We are not applying only readily available NLP tools. For example, we developed the text simplification module using linguistic patterns. This is a new contribution and is easily generalizable to other corpora and IE based tasks as well (also mentioned by Reviewer 3). There are a number of text simplification systems available but most of these have been trained on more encyclopedic data like Wikipedia. These tools fail to perform on free form text as we encountered. Extracting relationships between entities from simplified sentences is easier than extracting from complex sentences which contain multiple relationships between entities. Our task at hand is paraphrasing a sentence into several simpler ones without losing relational information. This is different from what has been addressed in existing tasks. In sentence simplification tasks, existing systems instead try to summarize/ extract the core information and ignore secondary information. These units of 'secondary information' are, in fact, information we do not want to discard in our task. Actually we applied this procedure in another published information extraction related task, where it proved to be very effective.\n3. Our system can be used for generating training data which could be useful for training end-to-end systems in the future. The gold dataset that we created would serve as a benchmark for the community to evaluate text to animation systems. \n4. We extensively evaluated of our system using intrinsic and extrinsic techniques. However, as mentioned in related work section (section 2), we could not compare to any of the existing text to animation systems as their implementations are not available and these systems have not been evaluated on any standard corpus, making it difficult to compare. We give examples in Table 2 and 4 and we analyze these in Section 5.1.1.\n""}"		Hkg5zW96p7	BkgZo8IUQV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper36/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper36/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	SJxDo7emfV	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper36/Authors']	1548277400846		1548277400846	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper36/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

596	1548276727191	{'title': 'reply on review', 'comment': 'SRL was used because as shown in [Christensen] off-the-shelf parsers can readily be used for IE with fairly good results and no need for training classifiers and large annotated data. We have tried to explain this rational in the intro, that is, that SRL is used out-of-the-box. \n\nOur tools and solutions are heavily based on Semantic Web standards, SPARQL, and triple stores. Most triple stores only store triples (some can store quads but only under strong restrictions), hence higher-arity relations cannot be stored unless reification is used which causes an “explosion” on their number. We are in the process of figuring out how to practically store such annotations on triples like TIME and LOCATION that come from SRL. \n\nWe have experimented with tools like Stanford’s (http://corenlp.run/) and Allen’s (https://demo.allennlp.org/open-information-extraction/) open Information Extraction in the past and the results were not very good for our purposes. These tools have been trained to be general purpose and the extracted facts are guide general. This can, e.g., be seen if one tries sentence “Optic neuritis is a common symptom that can cause blurred vision” at http://corenlp.run/. The NER component fails to identify “blurred vision” and hence the IE fails to extract relevant triples like <”Optic neuritis” “causes” “blurred vision”> which can be extracted using our approach. Regarding the Allen system, since it is based on SRL like ours it behaves well in this example but fails on sentence like “Common symptoms of malaria include fever” where a “lifting” of the noun-phrase relation is required. Given these observations and the fact that we wanted to have full control on the source code we decided to implement our own pipeline.\n\nWe updated the Evaluation section to state that indeed our implementation is using the system described by He et al. (AllenNLP). \n\nIndeed various sub-components of the system, like entity linking, can be improved but we can’t possibly make a state-of-the-art contribution to all faced problems. Just entity linking in the medical domain (disease normalisation) is a topic of research on it own and actually a paper specifically for this topic has been submitted to AKBC. Context can be used for disambiguation, however, note that our pipeline does not make a specific entity choice but returns a set of ranked top-n entities from the KB from which doctors select. \n\nWe have revised the paper regarding the issue of confidence values and SRL. SRL is a shallow parser and does not per se compute confidence scores for the extraction of information. Moreover, quoting from [Christensen]\n\t“Because of its use of an integer linear program, SRL-IE does not associate confidence values with extractions and is shown as a point in these figures.”\n\nWe have updated Table 1 with some corrected numbers. Regarding section 6.4 and 6.5, the two scoring approaches were developed in different points in time in which we had different sets of triples. Since these are different systems we don’t feel this is an issue.\n\nIn table 1 we only show the breakdown of accepted triples because for rejects, there is a number of different reasons that a triple can be rejected. It can be a failure to associate any or some precise IRI or even more, a doctor may change the proposed property into a different one and then accept the triple. Hence, it is almost impossible to track the rejects per property.  \n\nIndeed there is overlap with some of the relations used in Ernst et al. 2015. To make a comparison of the two works would require to run them over the exact same dataset and, to the best of our knowledge, the system is not available for download and testing.\n\nYes, it hasn’t happened that any triple with the affects relation has been generated by the doctor verification process. No treats, affects, and causes are different relations.\n\nThe reviewer is correct in the last point. The statistics in Table 1 do not use the ordering and pruning machinery that is presented in sections 6.4 and 6.5 because we hadn’t managed to integrate this work into the main production system yet. We are in the process of an additional evaluation and until the end of the rebuttal phase we will try provide some accuracy numbers with these machinery integrated in the main pipeline. \n'}		HJxmxbq66Q	r1gyZE8UXE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper20/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper20/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	4		['everyone']	Ske93-vjWV	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper20/Authors']	1548276727191		1548276751079	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper20/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']
597	1548276667107	{'title': 'reply', 'comment': 'The proposed heuristics help the IE algorithm to improve the recall of the extracted triples. That is, without the heuristics the standard SRL would extract no triple or it will extract a triple that would eventually get rejected. Measuring recall increase in IE is a very hard problem and with the current state-of-the-art is almost impossible to measure. There is actually a paper submission at AKBC on precisely this issue. Consequently, although we agree it would be very interesting to assess the effects of the heuristics it is, however, currently almost impossible. \n\nThe acceptance rate of 48% does not reflect the amount of correct/incorrect triples. There are plenty of correct triples that doctors reject, e.g., because they are not relevant to our use case (the triples are vague, imprecise, too general). For example, a triple of the form <”Malaria” “spread” “by mosquitoes”> is correct and arguably relevant for building a general purpose medical Knowledge Graph, however, it can’t be used for any symptom checking purposes. In addition, a doctor may reject a triple like <”gangrene” “occurs” “when body tissue dies”> because no precise IRI is linked to the phrases. We have revised the paper to make an attempt to explain these points better. We feel that 48% is actually a quite high score and doctors are indeed very cautious and selective.\n\nWe agree with the view of the reviewer about practical system for practitioners, however, we don’t feel this should be considered as a shortcoming. Being able to combine in a not trivial way existing or new solutions to difficult research problems is far from uninteresting and arguably is of academic relevance. In addition, we are making various non-trivial extensions and contributions to previous academic works like the copula verb pre-processing [Miwa 2010] and the noun-based relation extraction. Both of these techniques improve the generic SRL-based open IE approach presented initially in [Christensen]. Moreover, we evaluate KB-embedding based link prediction works on a real-world scenario and propose our combined approach for scoring and filtering. Finally, note that many of our extensions are based on dependency parsing and general linguistic properties, hence they are domain independent and transfer easier to new domains compared to learning methods. \n\nWe addressed all typos and editing comments pointed out by the reviewer. Indeed SRL is based on ML in the first place. We revised the text.\n\nYes, the SRL parser used is the AllenNLP one described by He et al. We mention this in the new version. \n\nUnfortunately, due to the anonymous paper submission instructions we cannot provide a reference to the document that provides further details of the PGM model and our diagnostic approach.

598	1548276630589	{'title': 'reply on review', 'comment': 'Although our examples and our work is motivated by the medical domain, all our techniques are domain independent and can be applied to any type of sentence. At its core the algorithm is based on the work of [Christensen] that used SRL for open-domain IE. Then, Algorithm 1 can be applied to sentences like “Barack Obama is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States” to extract triple <“Obama” “served” “as the 44th president of the United States”>. Alg 1 generalises and formalises the approach proposed in [Miwa 2010] by using dependency parsing, a method that is domain independent and is based on general linguistic properties. Algorithm 2 is also easily adaptable to other noun-type relations by passing a different set of relations as a parameter. Finally, our entity linking and all our filtering, scoring, and ranking algorithms are also domain independent and use off-the-shelf state-of-the-art tools like Google’s Universal sentence embedder and KB-embedding algorithms. Actually, we feel that our approach generalises and adapts to other domain and different sets of relations much better compared to distance supervision learning approaches which need to be retrained whenever a new domain or a new set of relations is considered.  \n\nOur motivation for the definitions is to formalise the approach and disclose all details in a precise way. We feel that just using examples leaves things vague, half specified and may not address all edge cases compared to a formal definition. We have included examples throughout the paper to explain how the algorithms work and in the newly uploaded version of the paper we made those examples more explicit as well as added an example for Definition 1. \n\nWe have revised the text involving the GATE system. We now refer to the system MetaMap which is a fairly standard tool for annotating medical text with concepts from the UMLS vocabulary. A reference to the system is also given.\n\nWe have revised the text to introduce the concept of embeddings and we also added references on the subject. \n\n“Alternative labels” have been introduced in Section 2. As stated, they are taken from the SKOS W3C standard and intuitively are used to capture synonymous labels.  \n\nThere is some confusion on the interpretation of the 48% acceptance rate mostly originating from our side and the difficulty to explain this number. First, in information extraction one can measure precision at two different stages. One stage could be over the extracted RAW text triples before entity linking. For example, from text “Gangrene occurs when body tissue dies” an IE tool could extract text triple <”gangrene” “occurs” “when body tissue dies”>. This is a correct triple and many previous approaches would count it as a successful extraction. However, if one tries to associate a concept to each of the phrases, no biomedical KB contains an entity for phrase “when body tissue dies”. Failure to associate a precise IRI would lead a doctor to reject the triple. Second, even semantically correct triples can also be rejected by our doctors if they think they are imprecise. For example, triples like <”Malaria” “spread” “by mosquitoes”> or <”OpticNeuritis” “symptomOf” “ImmuneSystemDiseases”> may be rejected by doctors since they are not relevant for symptom checking and diagnosis but represent some general knowledge. Given this very selective filtering done by doctors we actually feel that 48% acceptance is in contrary a very high one. We have tried several online demos of existing open IE frameworks and in most cases they extract such arguably correct but vague triples. \n'}		HJxmxbq66Q	BkgJi7ULmV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper20/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper20/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	BJe-nn8vGN	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper20/Authors']	1548276630589		1548276630589	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper20/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The social skill is critical in everyday life to reason about the potential consequences of their behaviors so as to plan ahead. It is known that humans use this reasoning ability recursively, i.e. considering what others believe about their own beliefs.  In this paper, we start  from level-$1$ recursion and introduce a probabilistic recursive reasoning (PR2) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that it is beneficial for each agent to account for how the opponents would react to its future behaviors. Under the PR2 framework, we adopt variational Bayes methods to approximate the opponents' conditional policy, to which each agent finds the  best response and then improve their own policy. We develop  decentralized-training-decentralized-execution  algorithms, PR2-Q and PR2-Actor-Critic, that are proved to converge in the self-play scenario when there is one Nash equilibrium. Our methods are tested on both the matrix game and the differential game, which have a non-trivial equilibrium where common gradient-based methods fail to converge. Our experiments show that it is critical to reason about how the opponents believe about what the agent believes.

To address these limitations, we introduce TRE, a Transformer for Relation Extraction, extending the OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer [Radford et al., 2018]. Unlike previous relation extraction models, TRE uses pre-trained deep language representations instead of explicit linguistic features to inform the relation classification and combines it with the self-attentive Transformer architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies between entity mentions. TRE allows us to learn implicit linguistic features solely from plain text corpora by unsupervised pre-training, before fine-tuning the learned language representations on the relation extraction task. TRE obtains a new state-of-the-art result on the TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8 datasets, achieving a test F1 of 67.4 and 87.1, respectively.

603	1548258356248	{'title': 'Response to Reviewer 2', 'comment': 'Thanks for the comments.  While we do not report downstream results in Section 6, we do in Section 8.  We did so in this setup so that we could first compare potential retrieval methods, and then test the DiscK method downstream.  We agree that reporting timed results would be ideal.  However, after a significant amount of engineering effort, we were unable to directly integrate the DiscK method into DNorm, as it is an older codebase.  Therefore, we run the DiscK retrieval method, save the results, and finally loading the results into DNorm.  This doesn’t allow for a fair comparison on timed efficiency, so we are left with the efficiency measurements we report in the paper.  In addition, thanks for correctly pointing out that instead of linear time, we should state that DiscK is sublinear time - this will be corrected in the paper.\n\nIn response to comment (1), it is true that the size of this dataset (125k concepts) could possibly allow for a pairwise model, as you suggest.  However, the mentions in this dataset are only linked to a subset of one ontology, SNOMED Disorders.  In real clinical settings, the size of the ontology is often much larger, as the entire ontology (SNOMED has 300K concepts) or several ontologies may be used in combination, leading to a concept set of 1 million or more.  Therefore, we wanted to approach this problem in a way that will scale to very large ontologies, and a pairwise approach, while potentially feasible for this dataset, would get computationally expensive quickly for larger ontology sets.  The downside of the pairwise approach extends to DNorm, which essentially performs a weighted similarity calculation between the tf-idf vector of the mention and the concept.  In larger settings, this will grow very slowly.  While most of the time concept linking is performed offline, there are several scenarios where online concept linking would be useful, such as a clinician seeking to process a specific clinical note.\n\nFollowing off of the above point, this is part of the reason we don’t simply make DNorm more efficient (as suggested in (2)), as it is still a pairwise method.  Furthermore, we wanted to propose a general method that would allow candidate generation for any system, and not simply speed up an existing one.\n\nAs noted in the response to reviewer #2, the DNorm system was one of the best performing systems on the task (at the release of the shared task results, see Pradhan et al 2015), so that point of comparison is available.  However, those results are on the test set, and aren’t directly comparable.  While we don’t currently have the code for any of the other systems reported in that paper, we do have access to a later system (“Sieve-Based Entity Linking for the Biomedical Domain”, D’Souza and Ng 2015), and we can use that as a point of comparison for the final paper.'}		r1xP1W56pQ	B1lnN2-L74	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper15/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper15/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	HJebHxu6x4	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper15/Authors']	1548258356248		1548258356248	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper15/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']
604	1548258311511	{'title': 'Response to reviewer 1', 'comment': 'Thanks for your comments on our work.  First, we can clarify several points on DiscK.  The goal of DiscK is to use a simple feature set to learn a weighted similarity between a query and a set of documents.  In our task, the query is a mention and the set of documents is a set of concepts from the UMLS.  It is parameterized in a way that allows for retrieval in sublinear time (as reviewer #2 points out, we incorrectly said “linear” - this will be corrected to “sublinear”).\n\nFor the training procedure, the weights θ are trained using a negative sampling procedure, with the goal of learning a set of weights that will correctly predict mention-concept pairs.  For each training mention, it is paired with the correct ontology entry and 50 incorrect ontology entries.  The resulting weights are used to project which ontology entry is most suited to the mention feature set.  This is trained using a log-linear model.    \n\nThe feature set we explored that included additional mention properties (e.g. the surrounding sentence and the definition of the concept, if available) used the same approach as the mention features, except that they included the text of the sentence or definition.

We honestly believe that it significantly contributed to improve our work. Being said that and given the nature of OpenReview, we would like to provide a response to the AC metareview which resulted in a reject decision. We think that his/her arguments were too limited to warrant over-riding the reviewer consensus for acceptance. In summary, from our point of view, the reasons appear vague, arbitrary in some aspects and/or were never raised during the reviewing period:\n\n\n\n1 (AC) “the quantitative results with weak supervision are not a big improvement over beta-vae-like methods or Mathieu et al.”\n \n→ It is not clear how “big improvements” should be for the AC not to be used as a reason to reject a paper. Experimentally, we find that our method improves over all the compared state-of-the-art methods on the evaluated datasets. The comparison with Mathieu et. al was added according to a suggestion by AnonReviewer2, who raise his/her score based on the provided results. Additionally, we show how our model can be applied to different problems (conditional image generation and attribute transfer) which can not be addressed using the compared methods.\n \n\n\n2 (AC) “a red flag of sorts to me is that it is not very clear where the gains are coming from: the authors claim to have done a fair comparison with the various baselines, but they introduce an entirely new encoder/decoder architecture that was likely (involuntarily, but still) tuned more to their method than others.”\n \n→ This point was not raised in any of the reviews and, therefore, we had not the opportunity to clarify it. As described in the paper, our networks are based on a standard conv/deconv networks with upsampling and downsampling operations. This is the most standard architecture used in VAE-based models and GAN literature. Moreover, our architecture uses exactly the same building blocks as [Karras et. al, 2018]. We think that characterising this as an “entirely new encoder/decoder architecture” is unreasonable. We did not explore other types of architecture designs and all the evaluated methods used the same hyper-parameters without any tuning.\n \n\n\n3 (AC) ""the setup as presented is somewhat artificial and less general than it could be (however, this was not a major factor in my decision). It is easy to get confused by the kind of disentangled representations that this work is aiming to get.""\n \n→ This point was raised by AnonReviewer1 during the revision. We clarified our concept of disentanglement and discussed different potential applications of our setup. We updated our paper accordingly. The reviewer was convinced by our response and raised his score to (Good paper, accept). No additional comments on this issue are provided by the AC.\n \n\n\n4 (AC) ""I think this has the potential to be a solid paper, but at this stage it\'s missing a number of ablation studies to truly understand what sets it apart from the previous work. At the very least, there is a number of architectural and training choices in Appendix D -- like the 0.25 dropout -- that require more explanation / empirical understanding and how they generalize to other datasets.""\n \n--> No description about the “number of ablation studies” is provided. A single concrete point is raised here: that we do not provide data on how the used dropout-rate of 0.25 generalizes to other datasets. First of all, we did not fine-tune this hyper-parameter given that we found that the default value worked well in all our experiments. Moreover, the lack of in-depth evaluation of how the used dropout rates generalize to other datasets seems plentiful across the papers in ICLR/ICML/NIPS/CVPR/ICCV/ECCV that use dropout strategies, and does not appear to be a commonly accepted reason to reject papers from publication. Finally, it is worth to clarify that the “dropout strategy” is only used in our model (because it is only applied when the discriminator uses features as input) and therefore, the results of the other baselines are not affected by this hyper-parameter.\n'}"		rkxraoRcF7	Byx9HkJUXN	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper797/Official_Comment	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper797/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	18		['everyone']	Sygjczi-xE	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper797/Authors']	1548246850435		1548246850435	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper797/Authors', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

A pragmatic solution comes from Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which use hardware and software protections to isolate sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack. However, these isolation guarantees come at a price in performance, compared to untrusted alternatives. This paper initiates the study of high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in TEEs by efficiently partitioning DNN computations between trusted and untrusted devices. Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme for matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX or Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor. We evaluate Slalom by running DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates work to an untrusted GPU.

We used the dictionary-based annotation system to obtain low-effort semi-automatic annotations of our data in order to avoid time-consuming manual annotations and guarantee high-quality annotations at the same time.

We believe that this paper is the first step which will hopefully spur more interest in this problem, and would eventually lead to industry-ready algorithms. However, this (current) limitation is not specific to this new problem, but common to many research problems (e.g. link prediction methods, for the moment, are far from meeting industrial requirements).\n\n2. Embeddings: This is again an excellent point. Please also see rebuttal for Reviewer #2. Subsets of latent factors capture signals related to different relational and numerical information. A metric learning approach that “selects” a group of latent factors relevant to a certain numerical attribute would make sense. However, during our experiments, we learned Mahalanobis metrics by incorporating an additional loss during the learning of knowledge graph embeddings, and it did not improve the overall performance.

Previous work: Thank you for bringing the work by Davidov and Rappoport (ACL 2010)  and Gupta et al. (EMNLP 2015) to our attention, we were not aware of this work. We will elaborate on these papers in the related work section. Regarding Gupta et al. (EMNLP 2015), the paper uses word2vec embeddings of named entities as inputs to a number of regression models. Similar to us, they aim to predict numerical attributes of knowledge base entities. Different to us, they leverage text information to do so. This is important, as in our problem we do not assume the existence of information other than the own graph structure. This relates to knowledge bases where entities’ names are unknown/anonymized  (e.g. medical knowledge bases). Nevertheless, this is very interesting and nicely complements our approach of learning from KG relationships as opposed to free text. Similarly, Davidov and Rappoport leverages text and/or class label information.\n\n2. Linear Regression: As you correctly observed, different output variables have different distributions. Ideally, for attributes that do not permit a normal distribution assumption one would need to validate (i) the power transformation to be applied to the data, and (ii) the regression function. This comes at an exponential cost, as this validation should be jointly done for a number of regression models. To circumvent this issue we used a common normalization procedure for all attributes. We also trained with L1-loss (Robust regression), which is more robust (w.r.t. outliers) than OLS, for all attributes but the results were similar.\n\n3. Label Propagation: Our assumption is that if two entities relate to the rest of the world in a similar manner, then they have similar numerical attributes. Nevertheless, your observation is an excellent point.\n\nLabel Propagation uses Euclidean distance between vectors to build the k-nearest neighbor graph. We speculate that subsets of entities’ latent factors could be encoding different relational and numerical information. For instance, it is possible that a few dimensions of the entity embeddings encode location information, while others encode population information and so on. For this reason, we learned Mahalanobis metrics for capturing different entity similarities. We did this while learning knowledge base embeddings by using an additional nearest neighbor loss. It did slightly improve the performance for few attributes, but overall it did not improve the results. We will include this discussion in the paper. Nevertheless, we suggest that future work should address this research direction in greater depth.\n'}		BJlh0x9ppQ	HJlb5B9EmV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper12/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper12/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	BJeOWyoxGN	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper12/Authors']	1548162440622		1548162440622	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper12/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

622	1548155437114	{'title': 'Response to comments', 'comment': 'Thank you for the helpful review.\n\nThe novelty of our submission is in the visual KB that we have created, the novel query types we propose, and the combination of standard CNNs with KB embedding scoring functions. We do not claim that the scoring functions are novel. What is novel is the combination of CNNs on image data with these scoring functions for the novel query types we propose. Our work shows that some existing scoring functions are not better than a concatenation, at least for the image retrieval task. We have explored the zero-shot learning setting in the link prediction problem for the first time in the literature. We think that this also makes the work novel.\n\nExperiments show that the difficulty and performance are different from that of the traditional link prediction problem. We have (adapted and) benchmarked some of the most standard scoring functions from the link prediction literature in this problem and show that: i) they work, to some extent, in the relation prediction task, and ii) they perform poorly in the image retrieval task, where the (naive) concatenation approach performs the best. We remark again the complexity of the latter problem (see rebuttal for reviewer 1). We think that this set of experiments constitutes a solid answer to the question regarding the ability of the traditional scoring function to answer these new types of visual queries.\n\nPlease also note the setup descriptions in Section 4.1.  In the image retrieval and link prediction scenarios, (experiments  (1) and (2)) we have images for which we do not know the underlying KG entities. This is the reason why we have not considered approaches that leverage entity embeddings, as this information is not available in our setting.\n\nThank you for your suggestion regarding the notation used to define certain operators. We completely agree. However, we think the notation (head, relation, tail) is not that uncommon, as it has been used in previous works (e.g. (Bordes et al. 2013), (Garcia-Duran&Niepert, 2017)).\n\nFinally, the probabilistic baseline is explained in Section 5.2 at the end of the second paragraph: “The second baseline (probabilistic baseline) computes the\nprobability of each relation type using the set of training and validation triples. The baseline\nranks relation types based on these prior probabilities.”\n'}		BylEpe9ppX	S1lSE5O4Q4	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper2/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper2/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	Byenu7AhbN	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper2/Authors']	1548155437114		1548155437114	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper2/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

After removing those entities from the graph, some relations were not present in the data set.\n\nWe could have replaced our feature extractor VGG-16 with more sophisticated/up-to-date CNNs such as ResNet or DenseNet. These models obtain moderate gains in accuracy on ImageNet, but they come at the cost of (largely) slower running times. In our opinion, the low performance relates to the difficulty of the problem. Our data set has 15 times more of categories/entities than ImageNet, hence the low performance in the image retrieval task. However, for the relation prediction task, where the output space is comparable to that of ImageNet, performances are much more competitive.\n\nWe agree that the experiments provide insights into the bias of the data set. Most importantly, the experiments show that the introduced problem is much harder than the traditional link prediction problem. We wanted to evaluate the scoring functions of state-of-the-art link prediction methods on the problems. At least for the visual entity prediction problem, these scoring functions did not work better than a concatenation.

We have responded to the comments below.', 'comment': '1. For instance, the basic definitions, e.g., the definitions of “mentions”, “events”, “attributes” and “relations”, are not clearly given. Due to brevity of space, we skipped over the definitions. Thank you for the suggestion, we are working on adding a supplementary section in the next revision, where in we will be adding the definitions and an end-to-end example.\n\n2. This work lacks the references to some works that also centers on constructing KG from a probabilistic perspective. (1) \tJay Pujara, Probabilistic Models for Scalable Knowledge Graph Construction. University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA 2016. (2) Knowledge Graph Identification. Jay Pujara, Hui Miao, Lise Getoor, William Cohen. 2013 International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC). What is the difference between this work and Pujara’s works?\nThank for you providing us with this information. We have updated the Related Work and compared our work with the above. \n\n3. The experiment is comparatively weak since there is no baseline or competitors. Plus, the scale of the dataset is relatively small as far as a normal KG is concerned. In consequence, it is hard to judge whether this method can achieve superior results on this problem.\nWe acknowledge this issue, however this dataset was first of its kind in having conflicting events with multiple viewpoints. Additionally, the dataset offered annotations across multiple languages. We are in the process of acquiring more data from LDC. Parallely, in our continued work we plan to apply our approach for the datasets: NELL and synthetic knowledge base from the LinkedBrainz project, and at least check the performance on entity and relation resolution if not events.\n\n1. What is the exact difference between “relation” and “event” in this work? It seems that much more emphasis is laid on “events”, while “relations” are barely mentioned.\nWe focused on more on events since they posed a harder challenge, often having multiple arguments. Relations were handled similar to events, as they can be considered events with two arguments always. Additionally, there were many conflicting events as compared to relations, hence due to brevity of space we focused more on events. \n\n2.Why is this approach effective and why should “patient argument”, instead of “instrument argument” be required?\nSuch an approach is effective because an event knowledge element (KE), is defined uniquely majorly by its event-type, patient and time. So, “attack on Mh17” is a different event KE than “attack on Kramatorsk”. Additionally,  we can’t use “instrument argument” as the restrictive constraint as same instruments like “missile”, “ak47”, could have been used in different attack events, which would cause noise in our candidate set. \n\n3. In the subsection “Event and Relation Grounding”, it is said that “In our domain, relations usually encode affiliations and location hierarchy, ...”. What about broader scenarios?\nThe parent-child analogy is a misnomer which we have corrected in our manuscript. For broader scenarios, since we treat  relations similar to events, a  factor graph  can be constructed over the event KE and a possible relevant relation KE.  Event sequencing on wikipedia or domain-specific corpora can be used to get the co-occurring relations and events, to handle broader scenarios.\n\n4. In the “Factors” subsection of Section 2.3, the given example seems not to be matched with Fig.4. In addition, what does the right part of Fig.4 try to express?\nThank for this helpful suggestion, we have fixed the figure. Since the observation has uniform probability distribution over either being a Spanish truck or a French truck, therefore the candidate set of {truck1, truck2} have entity KEs as a Spanish Truck and French truck. The right part of the figure shows the properties of the candidate set, which helped in selecting the existing KEs Truck1 and Truck2 for grounding.\n\n 5. Some use of terms are too casual.\nThank you for pointing that out, we have corrected the manuscript.\n\n6. Are there any measures to control the error propagations?\nOur current work, in continuation of this work, addresses this issue. We use an EM based approach, where we first keep the entity grounding constant and update the event/relation grounding. Then after some n number of documents, we fix the event/relation grounding and use that information to update the entity grounding. A joint learning of entity and event and relation grounding should be able to handle it. For instance, we ground a “missile” mention to ‘Russian missile’ Knowledge Element node. Keeping that fixed, we perform event/relation grounding and we observe that the probability of “Ukranian missile” is higher in all the events and relations where ‘Russian missile’ is also one interpretation. This could suggest that the grounding of the earlier ‘missile’ mention was incorrect and instead it should get grounded to ‘Ukrainian missile’ with higher probability. \n\n'}		SJeHzZqapm	SygFHOizXV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper34/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	rye0dAOPZN	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Authors']	1548036161240		1548036652085	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

We have responded to the comments below.', 'comment': 'If this understanding is correct, then I find Figure 4 misleading. \n-We have updated the figure to reflect our ideas more clearly.  The understanding you described in the prior comment is what we did indeed. \n\nIf variables represent distributions, how many variables are there actually for each observation? -The variables are bounded by the number of properties we consider for entity/event resolution. For instance, an event can have maximum variables as #(num of semantic roles) + 1 (target variable).\n\nActually, it is inference, unless with grounding they mean actually ""rolling"" out the factor graph. The terminology is quite unclear and misleading I find here. \n-By grounding we refer to the “rolling” out of the factor graph. Inference refers to the computation of marginal probabilities which we achieve through belief propagation. \n\nI understand that inference is performed using belief propagation. First of all, the authors mention that they graphs are loop-free. However, I do not see really why this would be the case. This would served some further explanation. Further, I do not see how exact inference can be tractable as there is an infinite number of possible distributions. There is some discretization involved, but this is not mentioned. \n-The reviewer is right. Exact inference is generally intractable. This is why the LEAPFROG engine uses  sum-product (belief propagation). In our application, we use a number of heuristics described in Section 2 to form a limited factor graph for belief propagation. Somewhat surprisingly, most of the resulting graphs didn’t have loops and sum-product worked fine. But we are not counting on that. We also use coarse discretization of numeric variables. Our representation of beliefs and belief propagation are definitely approximate. Unfortunately, space limitations forced us to leave out many details.\n\n\nThe evaluation shows that the approach delivers good results, but does not compare the results to other state-of-the-art approaches.\nThe main purpose of this work was to demonstrate an approach for conflating information by modeling different kinds of certainties across languages, especially for events. The dataset used in our work had the required annotations for uncertainties at even role level, which we didn’t find in any other dataset. Most datasets in KG construction focus on entity and relation resolution. But we do plan to test our approach at the entity and relation level, using factual knowledge from NELL and a synthetic KG  from the LinkedBrainz project. \n\nI was puzzled by the fact that the authors only provide Precision and Recall figures, but no F-Measures. Why is this the case? \nThere was no particular reason, usually in only F-measure the effect of an approach on Precision and recall is often not mentioned, hence we mentioned each of the metric separately. Thank you for the suggestion, we have updated the Table 2 and Table 4.\n\nThe results simulating the biases in Table 4 are interesting, but I wondered why the results do not come even close to the results in Table 2. \nThere were three primary reasons why Table 4 is far from Table2:\nThe bulk of the metrics rely on the efficiency of belief propagation to perform co-reference across multiple documents and languages.  Since, we used simple string-based heuristics for entity-co-references, many of the co-referent links which were paraphrases couldn’t be handled. We plan to include low-dimensional vectors to represent the entity nodes for better entity-coreference. Within a document, there weren’t many name variations hence these heuristics were able to achieve good entity co-coreference. To also avoid error propagation, in our ongoing we work we plan to address using a joint EM like learning approach where we update the entity co-references keeping event grounding constant and vice-versa.\n\nSecondly, many of the entities/events required commonsense and world knowledge for correct resolution. Like MH17 is also referred to as Malaysian aircraft, etc. \n\nTable 2 only considered information local to a document. Usually, a single document did not have many alternative interpretations and had <5 events on an average.\n\nIn general, the approach is interesting and promising, but large parts of the paper are imprecise, do not introduce properly the relevant notions, use non-standard terminology and obfuscate/omit important details.\nWe apologize, due to brevity of space, we couldn’t expand on the definitions and some model details. We are working on adding a supplementary section to the next revision.\n\nWhat I found inappropriate are the unwarranted and unjustified claims about how people infer interpretations. \n \nThe reviewer is absolutely right and we should not make such unsupported statements. Our intent was to acknowledge the possibility that our approximations may lead to mistakes, but that these mistakes seem to resemble human mistakes. We corrected the text accordingly.\n'}"		SJeHzZqapm	HkevQqiM74	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper34/Official_Comment	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	BkeDfugVMN	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Authors']	1548036639476		1548036639476	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Authors', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Also, this part is not evaluated at all, as the evaluation relied on annotations provided by LDC. I understand that this part is not the main focus of the manuscript. However, it is a problem that a thorough explanation is missing and also evaluation is also totally missing.""\n-Due to brevity of space, we kept this section short. We have updated the description to add more clarity to the section. Regarding evaluation - since we used the LDC annotated mentions, the evidence graph was constructed from these mentions, which would imply the evaluation over the evidence graph to be 100% accurate. Additionally, LDC provided only the complete knowledge graph and therefore we could evaluate only  our final KG.\n\n""Section 2.3, what do you mean : we ""leverage"" relation mentions.""\n-We use information from relation mentions like Sponsorship or Ownership  for entity disambiguation. For example, the “Spanish truck” has “entity-name: truck” and a relation “owned-by: Spain”. Another entity “French truck” has the same “entity-name: truck” but a different owner “owned-by: France”. Thus, using only name based heuristics will fail to disambiguate these entities and having additional information in the form of relation helps in entity disambiguation.\n\n""Section 2.3 it does not explain when and how a new KE is created.""\n-A new KE will be created in two cases: 1) if no candidate KEs are found 2) if after belief propagation the probability of a new KE ( for.eg the Truck3 in the target variable T in Figure 4) is above a specified threshold. \n\n""I could not understand the ""parent-child analogy"".""\n-The parent-child analogy was a misnomer, it has no significance. We have corrected it. \n\n""How the posterior of Obs(O2) is computed?""\n-The posterior of Obs(O2) is computed the exact same as computed for Obs(O1). Thus, \nP(obs2.property=x) = P(Obs1= x) P(certainty) + P(guess=x)*(1-P(certainty)). Due to brevity of space, we omitted this explicit description & have updated the paper. \n\t\n""Factor f1 captures the relation between the four parts of the observation"". Do you mean three parts?""\n-Yes, that is right. We have fixed that. \n\n""In section 3.2, how certainty is represented at an event level? Is it explained somewhere in the manuscript?""\n-At  the  event  level,  the  certainty  information  is  encoded  as  priors  of  the  target  variable T,  described in Section 4.2 similar to how its done for entities. In an ideal case, where observation event O1 is not hedged or negated, T has a uniform prior implying that all existing KEs (EventCandidate_1, EventCandidate_2) and the new possibility (Event_New) are equally likely T={EventCandidate_1: 0.33, EventCandidate_2: 0.33, Event_New: 0.33}. However, if O1 is hedged, the prior for the new event possibility (Event_New) is lowered, and the prior distribution  T={EventCandidate_1: 0.41, EventCandidate_2: 0.41, Event_New: 0.18}\n\n""which part of the framework is evaluated by which part of the experiment?""\n-Apologize for the confusion. The evaluation experiments in Table 2 and Table 4, show the ability of a belief propagation based engine to achieve cross-document and cross-lingual co-referencing across entities, events and relations, essentially constructing a knowledge graph from multi-lingual documents. \n\n""The discussion in section 4.4 is not very interesting. I do not think the case shows the benefit of using the proposed framework very well.""\n-The case study of showing different viewpoints based on country-specific sources is to demonstrate that how important it is to consider the information of a document’s source. If we change the country-wise bucketing strategy of sources and replace it with bucketing sources based on their reliability, the downstream application of this knowledge graph would help filtering or downweighting fake news or information from unreliable sources.

One of the main reasons is that BP requires symmetric weight matrices in the feedforward and feedback pathways. To address this “weight transport problem” (Grossberg, 1987), two biologically-plausible algorithms, proposed by Liao et al. (2016) and Lillicrap et al. (2016), relax BP’s weight symmetry requirements and demonstrate comparable learning capabilities to that of BP on small datasets. However, a recent study by Bartunov et al.

Here, we additionally evaluate the sign-symmetry (SS) algorithm (Liao et al., 2016), which differs from both BP and FA in that the feedback and feedforward weights do not share magnitudes but share signs. We examined the performance of sign-symmetry and feedback alignment on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets using different network architectures (ResNet-18 and AlexNet for ImageNet; RetinaNet for MS COCO). Surprisingly, networks trained with sign-symmetry can attain classification performance approaching that of BP-trained networks. These results complement the study by Bartunov et al.

We address each of your criticisms below:\n\n1. The implementation of feedback mentions is described in the third paragraph of section 2.3: “FMs are composed of two attribute maps” the first called “packaging” and the second called “payload”.  Immediately after this description, we provide intuition for why both attribute maps are needed. In section 3.1.1, we describe precisely how both of these attribute maps are used during canonicalization.\n\n2. The model, g, computes the linkage score between two nodes using their attribute maps.  This is described in the second paragraph in 3.1.1: “Since g scores the compatibility of two nodes based on their attribute maps...”. Perhaps we can further clarify this in the paper by including some text describing the linkage function g more precisely. \n\nThe precision of a node pair is used during training. In the first paragraph of section 4: “We train g to regress to the precision…” Thus, during learning we run agglomerative clustering and, at each merge, train g to predict the precision of the corresponding node pair.\n\n3. The function g is computed from the attribute maps of the corresponding nodes (which differ by dataset).  It is true that we omit the specific features that we use, for example, whether two nodes have the same title with a corresponding positive count in their respective attribute maps, or whether one node contains an attribute A with a positive count and the second node contains the attribute A with a negative count.  We are open to including these features in a supplement.\n\n4. We agree that the definition for complete could be revised to be clearer. We will modify the definition as follows:\nA node v is complete if for some $i$,\n\\lvs{e^\\star_i} \\subseteq lvs{v}.\nThus, if for some $i$, the leaves of $e^\\star_i$ are a subset of the leaves of $v$, then $v$ is complete. We note that the definition for complete is described in words immediately after the mathematical statement in the paper and is different from the definition of pure.\n\n5. What part of the detailed/concise feedback needs further explanation? As described in 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 and as detailed in the figure, the simulation procedure finds a “destination” and “target” for each edit.  The simulated edit contains a packaging that includes all of the positive attributes at the destination and a payload containing the attributes at the target (either with positive or negative weight, as described in the paper). We’re happy to describe the feedback generation process in more detail.\n\n6. We believe that qualitative results would not be very illuminating, but we’re open to including some.

The absence of any framework to analyze the precision requirements of partial sum accumulations results in conservative design choices. This imposes an upper-bound on the reduction of complexity of multiply-accumulate units. We present a statistical approach to analyze the impact of reduced accumulation precision on deep learning training. Observing that a bad choice for accumulation precision results in loss of information that manifests itself as a reduction in variance in an ensemble of partial sums, we derive a set of equations that relate this variance to the length of accumulation and the minimum number of bits needed for accumulation. We apply our analysis to three benchmark networks: CIFAR-10 ResNet 32, ImageNet ResNet 18 and ImageNet AlexNet.

Our model, a simple variant of the ResNet-50 architecture called BagNet, classifies an image based on the occurrences of small local image features without taking into account their spatial ordering. This strategy is closely related to the bag-of-feature (BoF) models popular before the onset of deep learning and reaches a surprisingly high accuracy on ImageNet (87.6% top-5 for 32 x 32 px features and Alexnet performance for 16 x16 px features). The constraint on local features makes it straight-forward to analyse how exactly each part of the image influences the classification. Furthermore, the BagNets behave similar to state-of-the art deep neural networks such as VGG-16, ResNet-152 or DenseNet-169 in terms of feature sensitivity, error distribution and interactions between image parts.

To do so, IB identifies an intermediate ""bottleneck"" variable T that has low mutual information I(X;T) and high mutual information I(Y;T). The ""IB curve"" characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal I(Y;T) for a given I(X;T), and is typically explored by maximizing the ""IB Lagrangian"", I(Y;T) - βI(X;T). In some cases, Y is a deterministic function of X, including many classification problems in supervised learning where the output class Y is a deterministic function of the input X. We demonstrate three caveats when using IB in any situation where Y is a deterministic function of X: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of β; (2) there are ""uninteresting"" trivial solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for multi-layer classifiers that achieve low prediction error, different layers cannot exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary to a recent proposal. We also show that when Y is a small perturbation away from being a deterministic function of X, these three caveats arise in an approximate way.

We are handling the same kind of phrases like all previous entity-oriented retrieval approaches [Zhang 07, Pound 12, Hou and Nayak 13, Han 17]. The EL language we use is a W3C standard, it is used in SNOMED CT, and it is more complex compared to the logic used in [Pound 12]. This language is to a great extent sufficient to capture the meaning in user queries since users never type special quantifiers like “in exactly two of my finger” or “in every arm”. Our approach extends and adapts in a trivial way a previous approach that uses dependency parsing and then recursively maps nodes to concepts to perform text interpretation. \n\nDuring submission we were working towards handling coordinated conjunctions but this part was not ready before the deadline. We have updated the paper with our new results (alg 2). It is in our plans to constantly extend the work to capture additional features like temporal information or negation but these can be topics of dedicated papers. In addition, in our case we would also need to extend the reasoning algorithm (section 4) to support these constructs. With such constructs reasoning becomes intractable (NP-hard) and hence the problem is far from trivial.\n\nOur medical KB and the construction pipeline have been published in the International Semantic Web conference in the main research track, the poster track as well as in various workshops. Due to double-blind review policies we cannot reveal more details about the KB or fully cite those papers. \n\nWe have added a reference and a small note about GATE. We apologize that we assume this systems as a standard one, it is almost a standard in the Semantic Web community. https://gate.ac.uk \n\nNED is indeed quite important but there are several reasons why we picked ElasticSearch. First, we wanted to provide a system that provides a max 200msec response time guarantee. Given all complex components of the algorithm this requirement is almost impossible to be achieved with heavy weight NED algorithms. Second, disambiguation approaches are more effective when processing paragraphs or large sentences rather than noun phrases. Some NED approaches had been attempted in the past but did not necessarily give better results. We have updated the paper to mention these design choices. \n\nThe datasets we used were indeed created in-house however they were not created by our team, hence, our results are not biased.

Entities from a KB can be used to annotate and semantically enrich data (e.g., holiday destinations or patient profiles) as well as build intelligent services (e.g., holiday booking or symptom checking engines). To access such information or services users usually form entity-centric queries expressed using noun phrases like ``Small Mediterranean Islands'', ``Cheap Pizza Restaurants'', or ``I have a pain in my left leg''. Answering such queries or matching them to the annotated entities is a challenging task since it requires a deeper understanding of their semantics as well as taking into account the axioms defined in the KB (both hierarchy and relations).\n\nIn the current paper we propose a framework for KB-based understanding and reasoning with such queries that is heavily based on formal Semantic Web technologies. First, we develop a method which given such short phrases it extracts a Description Logic concept in an attempt to formally capture their semantics. Second, we develop a novel reasoning algorithm which given two concepts constructed using entities from a KB compares them by possibly also exploiting information that is encoded in their text labels. The latter is necessary due to possible ``underspecification'' of KBs which hinders recall of formal reasoning methods. We demonstrate the feasibility and practical relevance of our approach by testing it in a real-world industrial strength application in Anonymous which develops an AI-based symptom checking dialogue system.

However, it turns out that such approaches fall short to capture complex real-world scenes, even falling behind in accuracy when compared to the plain deterministic approaches.

The paper applies these representations to the hierarchical coreference resolution problem using CRF. The authors also provide statistical analysis.

One of the main points of the papers is that sparse and high-dimensional representations of mentions creates problems during probabilistic inference. In order to overcome this problem, the authors propose various hashing-based methods. However, in light of recent advances in word embeddings, one is not limited to using such sparse and high-dimensional representations. One can potentially use off-the-shelf dense and relatively lower-dimensional embeddings such as word2vec, glove etc, or use context-dependent embeddings such as ELMO. Unfortunately, the paper completely ignores this line of research, and neither compares nor cites them. This is clearly not satisfactory, and the paper is not complete with such vital missing pieces.\n\nOverall, I think the paper proposes some interesting ideas, but it is incomplete in light of the issues above.

The goal of this work is to propose a unifying model of adversarial examples suitable for NLP tasks in both generative and classification settings. We define the notion of adversarial gain: based in control theory, it is a measure of the change in the output of a system relative to the perturbation of the input (caused by the so-called adversary) presented to the learner. This definition, as we show, can be used under different feature spaces and distance conditions to determine attack or defense effectiveness across different intuitive manifolds.

This work investigates this question in the context of pathology detection in newborns. The analysis of infant crying patterns to detect pathology is of interest as it opens the possibility of more accessible diagnostic tools in resource-constrained settings. Classical machine learning approaches leveraging features extracted as Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, have supported the viability of the infant cry as a diagnostic input, but performance is not yet at a level of clinical utility. The application of deep learning models has been limited due to the unavailability of large infant cry databases which are costly to acquire.

However, most existing adversarial training approaches are based on a specific type of adversarial attack. It may not provide sufficiently representative samples from the adversarial domain, leading to a weak generalization ability on adversarial examples from other attacks. Moreover, during the adversarial training, adversarial perturbations on inputs are usually crafted by fast single-step adversaries so as to scale to large datasets. This work is mainly focused on the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is difficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of representative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately reflect the adversarial domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method. Our intuition is to regard the adversarial training on FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task with limited number of target domain samples. The main idea is to learn a representation that is semantically meaningful and domain invariant on the clean domain as well as the adversarial domain. Empirical evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ATDA can greatly improve the generalization of adversarial training and the smoothness of the learned models, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. To show the transfer ability of our method, we also extend ATDA to the adversarial training on iterative attacks such as PGD-Adversial Training (PAT) and the defense performance is improved considerably.', 'keywords': ['adversarial training', 'domain adaptation', 'adversarial example', 'deep learning'], 'authorids': ['cbsong@hust.edu.cn', 'brooklet60@hust.edu.cn', 'wanglw@pku.edu.cn', 'jeh@cs.cornell.edu'], 'authors': ['Chuanbiao Song', 'Kun He', 'Liwei Wang', 'John E.

This study revisits MMD-GAN that uses the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the loss function for GAN and makes two contributions. First, we argue that the existing MMD loss function may discourage the learning of fine details in data as it attempts to contract the discriminator outputs of real data. To address this issue, we propose a repulsive loss function to actively learn the difference among the real data by simply rearranging the terms in MMD. Second, inspired by the hinge loss, we propose a bounded Gaussian kernel to stabilize the training of MMD-GAN with the repulsive loss function. The proposed methods are applied to the unsupervised image generation tasks on CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom datasets. Results show that the repulsive loss function significantly improves over the MMD loss at no additional computational cost and outperforms other representative loss functions.

The method requires named entity disambiguation to match the tokens in the query phrase to the concepts in the KB, for which the paper uses ElasticSearch. \n\nThe paper uses a new, unpublished medical KB made by integrating multiple KBs such as SNOMED CT, NCI, etc. The associated paper is made anonymous in the publication to get further details. The paper presents an evaluation on an in-house dataset made by doctors in the authors’ group which contain 1878 labeled pairs. \n\nThe paper compares to an approach called GATE that presumably performs exact match. (I failed to find the citation for this approach. I would appreciate if the authors could point that out in the author response.) The method is also compared to Google’s universal sentence embeddings and use it by finding the nearest neighboring concepts by encoding both the query and concepts using the sentence embedder. The proposed approach performs the best amongst the baseline approaches.\n\nI find that the paper has certain limitations which I think should be addressed before it is ready for publication. \n1. One major limitation of the proposed approach is that it can only be used for short noun phrases and it is unclear how the proposed algorithm can be improved to handle long and difficult queries containing multiple central concepts and quantifiers.\n2. In my understanding, the major heavy-lifting is done by the named-entity-disambiguation module, as also found out empirically in Sec 5.2. The paper should at least provide experimentation with different NED systems used, and better try to learn/fine-tune it using some kind of training data.\n3. I find that the evaluation experimentation is weak as the proposed is only tested on a single in-house KB, on relatively small number of queries. The evaluation could comprise of datasets based on Freebase, DBPedia or other large KBs, and compare to other methods proposed in the literature.\n\n', 'rating': '4: Ok but not good enough - rejection', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}		H1l8ag9a6m	S1gWjsDLGE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper3/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper3/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	H1l8ag9a6m	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper3/AnonReviewer2']	1547234200875		1547662994932	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper3/AnonReviewer2', 'AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

They initially present an excellent analysis of how fine grained entity type sets are not a direct extension of the usual coarse grained types (person, organization, etc) and hence training \\fger systems on data annotated on coarse grained typed datasets would lead to low recall systems. Secondly, they show that automatically created fine grained typed datasets are also not sufficient since it leads to low recall because of noisy distant supervision. This analysis was both an interesting read and also sets the stage for the main contribution of this work.\n\nThe main contribution of this work is to create a high recall large training corpora to facilitate \\fger and typing. The authors propose a staged pipeline which takes in input (a) a text corpus linked to a knowledge base (using noisy distant supervision), (b) a knowledge base (and also a list of aliases for entities) and (c) a typed hierarchy. All of these are readily available. The output is a high-recall linked corpus with linked entities to the KB and the type hierarchy. To show the usability of the training corpus the paper performs excellent intrinsic and extrinsic analysis. In the intrinsic analysis, they show that the new corpus indeed has a lot more mentions annotated. In the extrinsic analysis, they show that state art of the models trained on the new corpus has very impressive gains in recall when compared to the original existing datasets and also wiki dataset with distant supervision. There is a loss in precision though, but it is fairly small when compared to the massive gains in recall. This experiments warrants the usability of the generated training corpus and also the framework they stipulate which I think everyone should follow.\n\nGreat work!\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. In table 3, can you also report the difference in entities (and not entity mentions). I would be interested to see if you were able to find new entities. \n2. Are you planning to release the two training datasets (and if possible the code ?)\n\nSuggestion: The heuristics definitely work great but I think we can still do better if parts of stage  2 and 3 were replaced by a simple machine learned system. For example, in stage 2, just relying on heuristics to match to the prefix trees would result in always choosing the shortest alias and would be problematic if aliases of different entities share the same prefix. Restricting to entities in the document would definitely help here but still there might be unrecoverable errors. A simple model conditioned on the context would definitely perform better. Similarly in sentence 3, the POS based heuristics would just be more robust if a classifier is learned.

The authors propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nmethod that combines projection and self-training based approaches. For evaluation, the authors use cross-domain sentiment classification as an evaluation task citing precedent.\n\nstrengths:\n\n--The related work and explanation of the problem is relatively complete and well written. I would have liked to see some more intuition on projection in the earlier sections. \n\n--the approach is simple enough and I always consider that a significant strength, though it does appear a little bit like the authors tried some of the more established techniques experimentally and found that their workflow worked better than the individual techniques. This is fine, but it would be good to have some more insight (even if after-the-fact) on why the improvements were obtained.\n\n--overall, the experiments are well-described and replicable. They seem convincing and significant, and I think the notion that relatively simple pipelines can outperform more complex neural UDA is an important one that should be presented to the community. I have some minor concerns with experimental details that I have pointed out below.\n\n\nweaknesses:\n\n--I have heard (and personally witnessed) from many practitioners that summing the word embeddings is not always the best strategy for representing documents. Certainly, there are better methods now for learning document representations (even the now-classic topic models serve the purpose quite well with relatively normal datasets). So why not use one of those?\n\n--Is the pseudocode of Alg. 1 really necessary? The text explanation was clear enough. It's taking up space and 'looks' more impressive than it really is (training a classifier on S_L* and applying on T with threshold to obtain T_L')\n\n--from the evaluation description, it seems that labeled data was used from the target domain (for validation). Although this seems like (and has been presented as) a small detail my intuition suggests it may have ended up yielding better performance than would otherwise have been obtained. Some parameter sensitivity was explored in the experiments -- a little more on this issue at the beginning of the experiments section would have been useful. \n\n--Although I understand that acquiring datasets can be a problem, and I laud the authors' efforts to expand the 4-domain task that has been over-used at this point in UDA, it would still have been good to try the approach on one more problem.

While this kind of factoring is not new to this paper, the idea of creating some sort of ground truth for the knowledge competent is new. \n\nTo be honest, I struggle to understand the examples of the knowledge in the paper, or how they relate scenario.

I like the case breakdown, but the examples seem incomplete. What I really need to see are examples that are going into the NLI system after these transforms.  \n\nRegardless, the knowledge seems to be manually sourced with google, but the comparisons offered in the paper to other work seem to either not use explicit knowledge, or do not use ground truth retrievals from the internet.

Both approaches pre-train on CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2012 PropBank SRL data, followed by fine-tuning on the target domain (ProcessBank biological processes). One approach uses a manual mapping between source domain labels to target domain labels in an LSTM-CRF, and the other approach replaces the source domain CRF layer in a CNN-LSTM-CRF with a target-domain CRF (more here?) They evaluate their techniques by adapting PropBank SRL to ProcessBank annotations, showing that their best models improve over the state-of-the-art by >20 F1 absolute for both techniques, and that an additional 2.6 F1 can be obtained by modeling event-event relationships in ProcessBank (annotation not available in ProbBank).\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is empirical results showing that pre-training LSTM-CRF models on CoNLL-2005/2012 improves ProcessBank performance by about 20 F1 over Berant et al. (2014). This result is marginally interesting, but none of the proposed techniques are novel, the paper is not very clearly written, and while there are many experimental results, I\'m not convinced of their soundness. Why does the DeepSRLCRF perform worse than DeepSRL on the CoNLL datasets? I would not expect this result, and you do not provide a compelling explanation or analysis, which makes me think this result might be due to a bug, and raises suspicion about other results using this model. I also find it strange that the two adaptation techniques are applied to different base models, and there is no justification for this in the paper. The best performing model requires manual alignment between label sets, which is not very desirable, and would not extend well to transfer to more diverse data.\n\nQuestions:\n- Why use an LSTM-CRF with the first technique, and a CNN-LSTM-CRF for the second technique? Is there any rationale for this? It takes away from the results.\n\nStyle/writing comments:\n- may want to note that the source domain is PropBank in the abstract/intro\n- I find the edges in Figure 1 a bit strange. I think usually there would be one edge from the predicate (""reduced"") to the argument span (""the genetic variation fo the population""), rather than edges between each token in the span. Unless this is actually how you model dependencies between tokens/predicates/arguments (but I don\'t think this is the case). Using the same notation for ""Cause"" and ""Theme"" (big boxes at the top) is confusing since the semantics of the edges is quite different -- one is between predicates and the other is between a predicate and an argument. \n- Section 2, under ""Domain adaptation for SRL"": ""domain"" should not be capitalized. I also don\'t think question answering should be capitalized\n- Section 3.1: LSTM update formulas are completely unnecessary in this paper, since you don\'t modify them. Simply refer to Zhou and Xu (2015). This applies to many of the equations in this section (CRF, recurrent dropout, gated highway connections...) As a general rule, if you don\'t modify the equations you don\'t need to include them in the paper.\n- You say that you don\'t have any explicit constraints for decoding, but using Viterbi decoding is a slightly fancier version of enforcing BIO constraints (as in He et al. 2017).

They provide two domain adaptation approaches: 1) manually building a mapping between source and target label domains, 2) re-training the decoder layer on the target domain. In both cases, they pre-train models on a larger (source) dataset and then fine-tune on the target data. They compare two model architectures: 1) DeepSRL-CRF, similar to He et. al. (2017, 2018), except they replace the constrained A* decoder with a CRF and 2) CNN-LSTM-CRF as in Ma & Hovy (2016). \n\nTheir experimental results show competitive performance for their proposed model architectures on CoNLL compared to strong (SOTA) baselines. Their domain adaptation approaches combined with their proposed models outperformed non-trivial baselines.\n\nPro’s:\n-\tClear description of the task, motivation, and challenges associated with SRL in low resource domains.\n-\tExperimental results are promising. In particular, the “replace-CRF-layer” domain adaptation strategy both shows strong performance and is easily applicable to other sequence tagging tasks and underlying model architectures.\n-\tReproducibility: Their experiments included non-trivial, previously-published baselines on well-known, public benchmark datasets. The authors will release their code and models publicly, and they provide details about the hyperparameter settings used to train models. \n\nCon’s/Suggestions:\n-\tRelated Work: It was unclear to me which of the prior works cited on domain adaptation is directly related to the authors’ proposed approaches. Which work(s) have used the label-mapping strategy? Is the idea of adapting the CRF decoder layer of a LSTM-CRF (or other neural model) to the target domain a novel contribution and if so, which works inspired the idea? If not, which work initially proposed this approach and how has this strategy been applied since?\n\nThe authors should provide more detail about the Berant et. al. (2014) work, including concrete examples from the ProcessBank dataset and a description of the baseline system. Why was this corpus chosen? Also, why was biological-domain SRL chosen over other low-resource domains?\n\nThe authors should cite the CRF paper: Lafferty, John, Andrew McCallum, and Fernando CN Pereira. ""Conditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data."" (2001).\n\n-\tModels: The authors should succinctly state significant differences from approach He et. al. (2017) rather than re-explaining the whole paper. There was too much detail on this in Section 3.1. Also: What motivated these differences? Why did the authors decide to use a CRF instead of the original constrained A* decoding method?\n\nCNN-LSTM-CRF: What was the purpose of the 100-dimension predicate indicator? At the end of Section 3.1, they note that “We explicitly do not model predicate predication as we focus our efforts on the domain adaptation capability of the SRL given gold predicates."" Given this point, why did the authors then incorporate a predicate representation into the CNN-LSTM-CRF? It seems like the approach could be applied in both model architectures (i.e. concatenate a predicate indicator vector to the input word representations). As it stands, the fact that the CNN-LSTM-CRF has this additional information about the input might give it an unfair advantage. However, it’s possible I’ve misunderstood something about the two model architectures/implementations; if so, I would appreciate clarification. Also, why did they choose 100 dimensions? \n\n-\tCharacter-level features: The CNN-LSTM-CRF incorporates character-level features. It seems likely that this would be a significant advantage over word-only models in a low resource setting, since character-level features can help deal with out-of-vocabulary inputs with more expressive power than a single “UNK” word vector. I recommend that the authors provide some additional experiments and analysis to tease apart the effect of character-level representations vs. domain adaptation strategy vs. choice of model architecture. \n\n-\tCoNLL Experiments: The authors do not include the best CoNLL results from He et. al. (2017) in Table 2. In that paper, He et. al. report P/R/F of 85.0/84.3/84.6 (CoNLL 2005 WSJ) and 83.5/83.3/83.4 (CoNLL 2012). It is unclear to me why the authors chose to report a weaker result. If it was due to the fact that these results were for the ensembled “product-of-experts” model, why didn’t the authors attempt to incorporate this technique into their own work? Regardless, the authors should make a note of why they made this decision, so as to avoid misleading readers.\n\nWhy didn’t the authors report results for the CoNLL 2005 Brown test set in addition to WSJ? Since this test set is specifically designed to test systems’ ability to generalize to out-of-domain data, this would be a compelling additional experiment for assessing the strength of the “replace-CRF-layer” domain adaptation approach (the label-mapping approach does not apply, of course).  \n\nIt seems like more analysis is needed to explain why the DeepSRL-CRF performance is so much worse than that of the other systems. Was there a bug? Why types of errors did the system make? Are these errors that could be corrected by incorporating some of the constraints in the original DeepSRL system (e.g. BIO errors)? \n\n-\tProcessBank Experiments: The authors note that “pre-training on CoNLL 2012 was more effective than pre-training on CoNLL 2005”, and speculate that this was due to the fact that CoNLL 2012 is slightly larger. For completeness, why not just run another evaluation where all models are pre-trained on both datasets, combined? Or, even better, shuffle both together and evaluate performance over varying source dataset sizes? Which approach is most robust to smaller source dataset sizes, and which approach best takes advantage of additional data?\n\nCombining Tables 3 and 4 would improve readability.\n\n-\tAdditional Suggestions: The discussion of incorporating event-event relations is distracting and (in my opinion) irrelevant to the core proposed contribution of the paper. I recommend that the authors instead make brief a note of the fact that incorporating event-event relations improved results a lot, then handle further investigation of the subject in a separate paper. \n\nAlthough the authors leave this for future work, results for additional low-resource datasets (including CoNLL 2005/Brown) would make this paper more compelling. They should also consider applying these approaches to other sequence tagging tasks like POS tagging and NER. \n', 'rating': '6: Marginally above acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		Hklbplqp6X	SJxwwAqzGN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper1/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper1/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	4		['everyone']	Hklbplqp6X	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper1/AnonReviewer3']	1546985054728		1547662990204	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The evaluation just tells us that the system as a whole is somewhat effective, rather than how its components contribute to the overall performance. For example, I would have liked to see an ablation study of the different rules used in Algorithm 3.

The presented idea makes intuitive sense on a high level, and I think it\'s a good thing that this specific idea has been tested and that its performance is documented in this paper.\n\nMy main concern with the paper is that the proposed technique is not really novel, and seems like a minor natural extension of existing domain adaption literature. Another point is that it\'s not entirely clear to me how the pseudo-labels for the unlabelled target-domain instances can be produced already in step 2, since the projection of these instances is only done in step 3. Concretely, the noisy classifier trained in step 2 operates in the projection space S^*_L, but the pseudo-labels are produced for instances in the not-yet-projected space T_U. The authors consistently describe their three-step approach in this way, so I feel like this is not a small hiccup in one spot of the paper, but I must be missing something essential. It would be great if the authors could extend the description of that part in the paper.\n\nNits:\n\nI wonder if it made sense to already mention in the abstract/first page what task is used in this paper as a testbed for the proposed method, in particular since AKBC itself is very much motivated by a specific application context.\n\nSelf-training: Iterations limited to one - would be nice to see results for higher iteration numbers\n\nIn Sec. 4.1, the authors state that for this part of the experiments, the number of considered neighbors is fixed to one, ""for the ease of comparisons"". Off the top of my head, I\'m not seeing how the comparisons get easier by introducing this restriction.\n\nOn page 12, the authors try to make the point that a method should use as much unlabelled data as possible. I\'d say this is only true if utilizing additional data points actually improves results.\n\nIn Table 6, the proposed method is often outperformed by the ""neural"" competitors, while in Table 4/5 the presented method wins for all domain pairs against the ""classic"" algorithms.

It proposes a mechanism by which curators of primary ontologies can compute diffs between the knowledge in the primary source and Wikidata to decide which changes to include in the primary data source. \n\nThe paper proposes an interesting approach to extending ""closed"" ontologies that are typically managed, published and extended by some owning entity. This is the case for many biomedical and disease ontologies.\nThe starting point of the authors is that Wikidata as a collaboratively created knowledge base is seeded with knowledge coming from such primary data sources / existing ontologies. Following a crowd-sourcing approach, anyone can extend the knowledge coming from these ontologies in Wikipedia. The authors of the paper focus in particular on two type of changes: adding or changing cross-references as well as adding or changing superconcepts. In both cases, errors can be made.\n\nThe entities creating, hosting and evolving the primary ontologies have an interest in importing all those changes made by editors in Wikidata to extend their resource in a cost-effective way. However, as errors exist, some quality control is needed. The authors propose a mechanism by which curators of ontologies can compute diffs between the knowledge in Wikidata and the knowledge in their own ontology. Observed differences can trigger automatically change proposals that can be verified by human editors.\n\nOverall, the approach is interesting and is of practical relevance.

Nonetheless, I\'m ambivalent about the current state of the paper: While it provides an interesting and well-written read, and it\'s specific approach is well documented, I feel it falls short of delivering wider lessons learned.

Can you provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation of whether this approach pays of? I\'m crucially missing details on how big the external resources are, could the expert instead directly review them? How dynamic are the resources, i.e., how much is gained by a community continuously reviewing them, versus a one-off review by an expert?\n - What are the social/ethical dimensions of this approach? Are individual Wikidata editors acknowledged in the external resource? It seems both sides give and take, i.e., the external resources contribute data to Wikidata as well, so this should be fine, nonetheless a short discussion would be appreciated.\n - What level of knowledge is required to contribute to the present domain? How many Wikidata editors were actually doing the edits? 3? 15? 150? Are these John Doe\'s adding information about ""headache"" and ""coughing"", or likely medical experts themselves, possibly even contributing to Wikidata in professional roles?\n - Some placement of the work in the wider area would be appreciated, is this a singular approach? Are there other organizations (GLAMs maybe?) that run similar processes over Wikidata?\n - It\'s surely naive, but what are reasons why the external resources are not fully merged into Wikidata, from then on only edited there?

It lays out the problem rather clearly and defines datasets, a number of baselines\nas well as a range of embedding-based models that I like because they include both simple pipeline models \n(learn embeddings first, predict numerical attributes later) and models that include the numerical attributes\ninto embedding learning. I also appreciate that the paper makes an attempt to draw together ideas from different\nresearch directions.\n\nOverall, I like the paper. It\'s very solidly done and can serve as excellent base for further studies. Of course, I also have comments/criticisms.\n\nFirst, the authors state that one of the contributions of the paper is to ""introduce the problem of predicting the value \nof entities’ numerical attributes in KB"". This is unfortunately not true. There is relatively old work by Davidov and\nRappoport (ACL 2010) on learning numeric attributes from the web (albeit without a specific reference to KBs), and \na more recent study specifically aimed at attributes from KBs (Gupta et al. EMNLP 2015) which proposed and modelled exactly the same task, including defining freely available FreeBase-derived datasets.\nMore generally speaking, the authors seem to be very up to date regarding approaches that learn embeddings directly\nfrom the KB, but not regarding approaches that use text-based embeddings. This is unfortunate, since the\nmodel that we defined is closely related to the LR model defined in the current paper, but no direct comparison is \npossible due to the differences in embeddings and dataset.\n\nSecond, I feel that not enough motivation is given for some of the models and their design decisions. For example,\nthe choice of linear regression seems rather questionable to me, since the assumptions of linear regression (normal distribution/homoscedasticity) are clearly violated by many KB attributes. If you predict, say, country populations, the \nerror for China and India is orders of magnitude higher then the error for other countries, and the predictions are dominated by the fit to these outliers. This not only concerns the models but also the evaluation, because\nMAE/RMSE also only make sense when you assume that the attributes scale linearly -- Gupta et al. 2015 use this\nas motivation for using logistic regression and a rank-based evaluation. \nI realize that you comment on non-linear regression on p.12 and give a normalized evaluation on p.13: \nI appreciate that, even though I think that it only addresses the problem to an extent.\n\nSimilarly, I like the label propagation idea (p. 7) but I lack the intuition why LP should work on (all) numeric attributes.\nIf, say, two countries border each other, I would expect their lat/long to be similar, but why should their (absolute) GDP be similar? What is lacking here is a somewhat more substantial discussion of the assumptions that this (and the other) \nmodels make about the structure of the knowledge graph and the semantics of the attributes.\n\nSmaller comment:\n* Top of p.5, formalization: This looks like f is a general function, but I assume that one f is supposed to be learned\n   for each attribute? Either it should be f_a, or f should have the signature E x A -> R.\n   (p4: Why is N used as a separate type for numeric attributes if the function f is then supposed to map into reals anyway?)\n\n', 'rating': '8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		BJlh0x9ppQ	BJeOWyoxGN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper12/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper12/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	BJlh0x9ppQ	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper12/AnonReviewer2']	1546854143616		1547662985156	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The paper contains little modeling novelty. It narrows down the scope of ""structured queries"" to one-hop ""KB triple fragments"" and adopts off-the-shelf neural machine comprehension (MC) models. However, the idea that ""MC models can be used to answer structured KB queries"" has been shown in the CoNLL paper by (Omer et. al 2017), where MC models were used for zero-shot relation extraction by completing triple pattern fragments.\n2.

For example, (Welbl et. al. 2018) reported significant answer candidate imbalance in the initial WikiHop collection, i.e. some entities are much more likely to appear as an answer than others and a majority class baseline would be very competitive. Similar issues should be studied and controlled for the new dataset used in this paper as well. To this reviewer, a more reasonable approach is to also test the proposed system on existing KB-text benchmark datasets such as WikiHop.\n3. This paper does not provide evidence to support its main claim that ""using text as the database has a number of potential benefits"". For a fair comparison on accuracy, the paper should conduct a head-to-head comparison of the performance of models that use only text vs. those also use a pre-extracted KB. If the ones with access to KBs demonstrate a big performance jump, it is an evidence that pre-extracted KBs are beneficial. (This experiment should be carried out on QA datasets with natural language questions so as not to give models with access to KBs an advantage.) Efficiency-wise, the paper claims that having a separate KB representations incur maintenance cost and synchronization issues. However, query execution on KBs can be highly optimized. On the other hand, text processing and NN execution can sometimes trigger extra overhead.

Each training example is created from a triple with an unbound variable using the textual descriptions of the properties and the entities.

Although this work claims it ""eliminates the need to have an intermediate database in order to answer structured database queries over text"", it actually depends on an existing knowledge base to create the training data.

Further, entity representations from the siamese network also improve the performance when transferred to an existing state-of-the-art relation extraction model.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and well motivated, though sometimes needlessly verbose.

773	1545596985045	"{'title': 'Some efficiency gains, but more rigorous evaluation and motivation required', 'review': 'This paper proposes using an existing method, DiscK, to pre-filter candidate concepts for a medical concept linking system. When combined with an existing state-of-the-art linker (DNorm), the joint system is able to consider much fewer candidate concepts, albeit with some drop in accuracy. These results are potentially significant, but assessing the actual impact requires additional measurements and better explanation of the motivation.\n\nPros:\n- DiscK + DNorm achieves concept linking accuracy close to the previous state-of-the-art, while requiring DNorm to process significantly fewer candidates. For example, the system gets up to .759 MRR when considering 2000 candidates, compared to .781 MRR for the full set of ~125K candidates (Table 5).\n\nCons:\n- Evaluation of candidate generation without downstream linking (Section 6) was not compelling. Without information about how the linker might use these candidate sets, it is hard to tell whether these numbers are good or not.\n- The claims of superior computational efficiency in Section 8 are not supported quantitatively. There should be a comparison between DNorm alone and DiscK + DNorm of how many mentions or documents can be processed per second. Otherwise, it is not clear how much overhead DiscK adds compared to the cost of running DNorm on more candidates. Hopefully this issue can be easily addressed.\n- Writing was at times unclear and misleading. Most importantly, the authors write, ""DiscK allows us to efficiently retrieve candidates over a large ontology in linear time."" In fact the point of DiscK is that it enables sublinear queries in the size of the candidate space/ontology. But perhaps the authors are referring to being linear in something else? After all, pairwise scoring models are also linear in the size of the candidate space.\n- Straightforward application of existing approaches, with no new technical contribution\n\nAdditional comments:\n- As an outsider to this medical linking task, I wanted to understand more why speed is important. How expensive is it to run DNorm on a large corpus? Are there online settings in which low latency is desired, or is this only for offline processing?\n- I would like some discussion of two other seemingly more obvious ways to improve runtime:\n    (1) Learn a fast pairwise comparison model and filter using that. The number of candidates is large but not unmanageably large (125K), so it seems possible that you could still get significant wall clock speedups by doing this (especially as this is very parallelizable). Such an approach would also not have to abide by the restrictions imposed by the DiscK framework.\n    (2) Speed up DNorm directly. Based on the original paper (Leaman et al., 2013), it seems that DNorm is slow primarily because of the use of high-dimensional tf-idf vectors. Is this correct? If so, might a simple dimensionality reduction technique, or use of lower-dimensional word vectors (e.g. from word2vec) already make DNorm much more efficient, and thus obviate the need for incorporating DiscK? Relatedly, are other published linkers as slow as DNorm, or much faster?\n- Based on table 5, in practice you would probably choose a relatively high value of K (say ~2000), to maintain near state-of-the-art accuracy. We also know that at high values of K, character 4-gram is competitive with or even better than DiscK. So, what is the runtime profile of the character 4-gram approach? Footnote 8 mentions that it is asymptotically slower, but computing these character overlaps should be very fast, so perhaps speed is not actually a big issue (especially compared to the time it takes DNorm to process the remaining K candidates). This is is related to point (1) above.\n- The authors mention that DNorm is state-of-the-art, but they don\'t provide context for how well other approaches do on this linking task. It would be good to know whether combining DiscK + DNorm is competitive with say, the 2nd or 3rd-best approaches.\n- The organization of this paper was strange. In particular, Section 8 had the most important results, but was put after Discussion (Section 7) and was not integrated into the actual ""Evaluation and Results"" section (Section 6).\n- Measuring MRR in Section 6 is unmotivated if you claim you\'re only evaluating candidate generation, and plan to re-rank all the candidate sets with another system anyways. It is still good to report these MRR numbers, so that they can be compared with the numbers in Section 8, so perhaps all of the MRR\'s should be reported together.', 'rating': '5: Marginally below acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		r1xP1W56pQ	HJebHxu6x4	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper15/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper15/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	r1xP1W56pQ	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper15/AnonReviewer3']	1545596985045		1547662983787	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

How are the feature weights chosen? How are the feature parameters trained? What’s the difference between a feature type and a feature value?

Since examples requiring non-lexical features were a consistent source of error, why do the authors think that non-span-based features failed to influence model performance on these examples?\n \n-\tData: It is unclear to me whether expanding the ontology to include the additional concepts (e.g. Finding) would prevent comparison with other systems for this dataset, and what is gained from this decision.

Since direct comparisons with prior work were omitted, it is hard to gauge the strength of the baselines and proposed system.  \n\nIn addition, it might be useful to test the value of higher MRR in the downstream concept linking task by comparing the DiscK-based candidate generator against one of the baseline approaches with higher coverage but lower MRR. Can DNorm capitalize on a more informative ranking, or are the results similar as long as a basic level of coverage is achieved for a given k?\n\n-\tRelated Work: The authors only briefly mention entity linking work outside of the biomedical domain.

The authors train an LSTM-CRF  model to copy silver labels generated by a rule-based system. They evaluate and train on a diverse set of text sources, and show that their proposed model is able to generalize reasonably well across text sources and from silver labels to manually-annotated gold labels. The main flaw of this paper is that no previous botanical NER systems, such as a rule-based approach, are evaluated in comparison with the LSTM approach.\n\nPros:\n- Well-written paper with thorough description of system and data collection; good use of illustrative examples (though as an English reader I might appreciate more English examples).\n- Sensible distant supervision approach to get labels for training\n- Text pulled from a variety of sources (Wikipedia, academic articles, blogs) to ensure applicability to a wide variety of documents. Both within-domain and cross-domain accuracy are reported (Table 7), with accuracy remaining quite high in the cross-domain setting (mid 80s to low 90s F1).\n- Includes gold test data annotated by humans, on which the proposed method does reasonably well (82.4 F1)\n\nCons:\n- No comparison to existing botanical NER systems, such as those mentioned in the related work section. In my opinion, this is the main flaw of the paper; if the LSTM does improve over the previous systems on the gold-labeled data, this paper should be a clear accept. At the very least, I would like an evaluation of using the dictionary-based annotations alone (Section 3.3) as test-time predictions. If I understand correctly, this would obtain 100% accuracy on the ""silver-labeled"" data, but there is an open question of how well it generalizes to the gold labels. This would simulate a comparison with SPECIES (Pafilis et al., 2013), but using the same set of gazetteer resources.\n\nOther comments:\n- This type of distant supervision strategy often encourages neural models to memorize the set of strings in the dictionary. In relation extraction, you would commonly mask out entity names (replacing them with a type token) to combat this. Did you observe similar issues? This seems related to your observation that higher dropout helps in a cross-domain setting, as higher dropout makes it harder to memorize the dictionary.\n- I would appreciate a little more discussion of the difference between distant supervision and human-annotated labels, given that the difference in F-scores in Table 9 is very significant.

776	1546975456642	"{'title': 'Useful datasets but insufficient experimental evidence to support proposed approach.', 'review': 'This work targets NER for both scientific and vernacular plant names across languages and domains. Solving this task is important for integrating information from both formal scientific texts and low-resource sources like folk medicine and ethnobotany. The task is difficult because of 1) the paucity of prior work on vernacular plant name recognition and 2) the broader problem of applying NER systems to low-resource settings.\n\nThe authors’ approach is two-pronged. First, they use semi-supervised learning, i.e. they collect a large corpus of noisily-labeled data using an automated system. Second, they train a LSTM-CRF model that integrates both word- and character-level input. They hypothesize that their approach will lead to better generalization across domains without relying on expensive hand-crafted/domain-specific features.\n\nIn order to test their hypothesis, they gather several semi-supervised datasets from four different genres and two languages (English and German), annotating them using several different gazetteers that the authors also collected from various data sources targeting both scientific (Latin) and vernacular names. In their experiments, they compare the LSTM-CRF architecture trained with vs. without initialization to pre-trained FastText word embeddings. \n\nPro’s:\n-\tThe authors collect several different corpora and gazetteers. The former could serve as benchmark datasets for future work on this task. The corpora vary in formality, content (w.r.t. scientific vs. vernacular plant name mentions), and publication time (recent vs. historical). These are all productive axes along which to compare NER system strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, the gazetteers will provide an valuable resource for future system comparisons. The authors note that all of these resources will be publicly available.\n\nCon’s and Suggestions:\n-\tStyle: Much of the writing in this paper is poorly organized. In the Introduction and Related Work sections, the authors tend to jump around to several different topics within the same paragraph. The result is that the information presented lacks cohesion, so it is difficult to elucidate the motivation for this work and, more importantly, its contribution to the task at hand in the context of prior work. Some of the sections are also poorly organized: for example, in the Method section (3), the authors start to summarize how they used their gazetteers to annotate data (3.1.1), then they jump into the specifics of the corpora that they collected (3.1.2), then jump back to describing their annotation methodology (3.3). \n\n-\tRelated Work needs more work: The authors describe many prior results and systems in the Related Work section, but are inconsistent about directly comparing these to facets of their approach. \n\nFor example, though the authors claim that little prior work has been done on extraction of vernacular plant names, they do not address this point cohesively in the Related Work section (e.g. they don’t mention that CoL includes both scientific and vernacular names). Which systems/datasets have attempted to address this issue? If there is truly no prior work in this area, state this fact clearly and talk about the research process.\n\nI recommend organizing the Related Work into several clear sub-sections, for example: “NER” (quickly summarize the task and describe common approaches e.g. rule-based, dictionary-based, first generation ML, neural taggers); “Biological/botanical NER” (talk about problems specific to the domain e.g. it’s low-resource setting, as well as major results in the area); “Vernacular plant name extraction”; and “Semi-supervised learning for NER”. \n\nThe authors should cite the “original” LSTM-CRF paper: Huang, Zhiheng, Wei Xu, and Kai Yu. ""Bidirectional LSTM-CRF models for sequence tagging."" arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.01991 (2015).\n\n-\tExperiments: The authors’ experiments do not show compelling evidence that supports (or negates) their hypotheses. \n\nClaim #1: “This approach is based on both character-level and token-level word representations, which are especially valuable when processing morphologically rich languages like German. Hence, we are able to identify taxonomic mentions not only a scientific (Latin) but also on a vernacular level (German or English).” \n\nTo test this claim, they examine the impact of changing the size of the character embedding dimension from 25 to 29. They conclude that “augmenting the embedding size…has only a very small and not significant positive influence…”. However, in my opinion, a better experiment would have been getting rid of the character-level input entirely and comparing word-only vs. word+character vs. character-only. \n\nAlso, the dimension of the character representation is not the only axis of variation. Presumably, the character-level representations have a large effect on model predictions for out-of-vocabulary words. The authors could test whether character-level representation actually helps generalization to new domains by testing on a set of held-out plant name mentions that are absent from the training data (and thus the learned word-level vocabulary) and see if performance improves over using word-level information alone.\n\nFinally, comparing 25 vs. 29 seems arbitrary in the first place – why did the authors choose 29 over, say, 1000? Why didn’t they run the same experiment for English, which is presumably less morphologically inflected? If varying properties of the character representations have a greater effect for German than English, then at least part of their claim would have supporting experimental evidence.\n\nClaim #2: “ We claim that our approach combining automated data annotation based on dictionary lookups and the subsequent training of neural models can guarantee good performance even without the availability of large precompiled language-specific gazetteers.” \n\nIn other words: domain-specific gazetteers are expensive and must be kept up-to-date. The authors claim that systems only need access to such gazetteers at training time (to get noisy “oracle” labels), because their LSTM-CRF will generalize. \n\nThey attempt to show this by training their model on a Wikipedia-based corpus and testing on the other corpora they collected. However, they don’t guarantee that entities mentioned in the training data are actually absent from any of the test corpora. In other words, while their experiments show that the LSTM-CRF is able to generalize to a variety of unseen entity contexts, they fail to show that their model can also generalize to unseen entities. However, generalization to unseen entities is the crux of the problem: this is why gazetteers need to be updated in the first place.\n\nThey also do not show to what extent gazetteer size and quality affect downstream performance. Briefly, they note that, for German, “we assume model performance is higher due to the larger datasets and cleaner gazetteers”, but they fail to explore this in detail. What would happen if the gazetteers they used for weak supervision only contained a few entries? How noisy can their noisy labels be? \n\n-\tInadequate baselines: The authors fail to compare their LSTM-CRF approach to adequate baselines. In the results section, they focus on comparing only the LSTM-CRF architecture initialized without (baseline) vs. with pre-trained FastText embeddings.\n\nThe most straightforward baseline is their dictionary-based annotation system itself. Briefly, they note that their automatic annotator assigned tags with an F1 of 85.05 on a hand-annotated, gold-standard test set. It is unclear from the context whether this evaluation targeted German, English, or both. Later, in the Results section, their results for their best German LSTM-CRF were substantially worse than this baseline (Table 9 reports an F1 of 82.42). \n\nThe problem is that, while 85.05 F1 is probably the best possible score for the system presented in this work, it is unclear whether 1) 85.05 F1 is a competitive result for this task overall and 2) whether the LSTM-CRF is well-suited to this task. How would a system trained on a smaller but fully-supervised dataset perform on this test set? How does a non-neural architecture with hand-crafted features stack up? \n\nIt is also unclear to me why they do not report corresponding results for a hand-labeled English test set. They also omit details about how many and what variety of entities are included in this test set, and don’t report quality metrics like inter-annotator agreement.\n\nFinally, they fail adequately address prior work in their experiments. In the Discussion, they briefly note that “Habibi et. al. (2017) report a f-score of 83.60% for the species label”, but it is unclear to me whether this is a fair comparison; however, this is the only direct comparison with previously published work that the authors provide. While it is true that the authors created several new datasets for this task, it would have been informative to re-implement and re-run previously-published systems/approaches on these new datasets. \n\nFurthermore, since the authors propose a system for extracting both scientific and vernacular names, and since there seems to be plenty of prior work on scientific name extraction, they could run their system on an existing corpus containing only scientific names and compare to published results along that axis. This would be an informative sanity check for the relative performance of the LSTM-CRF vs. other systems.\n\n-\tOther issues with the experiments: Although they train using 5-fold cross-validation, they fail to report error bars for their results and they do not note whether the results presented represent the average test performance or just the best runs. \n\nWhile they note that they use “default hyperparameters” for their baseline, as far as IO can tell, they do not note whether or not they tuned the hyperparameters for their non-baseline system (and if they did tune, they don’t note what the final hyperparameter settings were, nor how many runs of tuning were required to get the results presented).\n', 'rating': '3: Clear rejection', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		rkeFyWcTTm	S1gK1F_fMN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper16/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper16/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	rkeFyWcTTm	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper16/AnonReviewer2']	1546975456642		1547662983063	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The review embedding represents the difference between users and items and can be used for rating prediction. The author conducted experiments on Amazon user review dataset and demonstrated improved performance compared with other state of the art methods.  The method is straightforward and works better than other methods in most cases on Amazon dataset.\n\nHowever, the proposed method depends heavily on review data, which in real world application is usually very sparse and hard to acquire compared with other user behavior such as clicks and views. The author broke down Amazon dataset into different groups based on item category and ran experiments separately on each group. As a result, all the experiments were essentially done on one dataset, but the author claim “TRANSREV outperforms state of the art recommender systems on a large number of benchmark data sets”. The author should also extend evaluation on other datasets. \n\nAlso, by grouping data based on their category, each subset has only one topic, which makes sense for training the model. However, because review embedding learnt from one product category, which can hardly be used for predicting ratings in the other category.

As in, does the IE system retrieve all possible facts on a given domain? They motivate their framework with a number of interesting applications.\n\nI thought the idea was really cool, and the motivations were compelling. The paper was well-written. Additionally, authors go to lengths to provide explanations using their interpretable classifier, SVM, which I appreciated. Admittedly, I did not find the results super compelling, but I think that\'s passable as it\'s a novel idea that can be expanded upon.\n\nA primary concern was that, perhaps because this is a new approach as the authors say, the reader would be better served if the problem statement on page 6 were clearer. Despite introducing notation, the authors do not make much use of the notation for developing their problem statement. \n\nAs I understand, the forumation is:\n\nt: input text\nF: facts extracted from input text\nall facts\n\nIn paragraph 2 of page 6, should ""t"" be ""F""? Authors simply say ""all these facts"" in that paragraph, but the preceding paragraph mentioned two sets of facts: ""facts in t, F"" and ""all facts in the world about a topic"".\n\nOn first read, it was totally unclear that the authors are using the text to infer, linguistically, whether a set of facts is complete or not. I urge the authors to put some more time in clarifying this. Maybe one way to do this would be to write a simple equation showing the prediction task?\n\n\nMy next point:, authors define the prediction problem as binary: whether t contains all known facts (1) or not (0). Authors mention later on that this is an imbalanced set. That is an interesting discussion point. I\'m curious also what implications this has for training. Did authors try balancing their data before training? What is the distribution over probabilities that their classifier gives to training examples? Are they OK-looking? Perhaps not necessary for the paper, I\'m just scratching my head over whether there might be pathological training errors here. Some deeper discussion into class imbalance at train-time would be nice.\n\n\nFinally: authors give an interesting linguistic hypothesis for why t should signal towards this problem. They then compare to human annotation. What about comparing to a known closed IE set? Granted, Recall-Assessment classifiers is clearly meant for OpenIE settings, but I\'d be curious to see how was a recall-assessor, f( t, F) performs relative to closed IE settings where recall can be wholly observed. Is it close?\n\nOverall, it\'s an interesting idea but I think it could be developed more. There\'s a lot in this paper that doesn\'t seem to lead anywhere.

781	1546608382531	"{'title': 'Doubts in methodology; mainly engineering work', 'review': 'This paper uses a variant of the transformer encoder for relation classification. In particular, entity representations are used to calculate attention weights for the context words. The authors achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets.\nDespite that, I have two major concerns: (1) about the methodology (attention using entities only), (2) about the engineering effort. In the following paragraphs, I will describe them in more detail.\n\n(1) methodology: I do not see why entities should be useful for extracting context words that indicate a relation. That would mean that relation-specific information is encoded in the entity names already. In fact, this might be the case for ELMo embeddings since they are context dependent but would not work with other embeddings, especially when an entity is rare and has not been mentioned in the context of a specific relation in the training dataset for the embeddings. This is basically the result the authors get when they compare ELMo embeddings + attention only with GloVe embeddings + attention only on the SemEval dataset. However, entities in SemEval are nominal phrases which might actually be very indicative of their possible relations already. I would expect an even more severe drop in performance for the TACRED dataset which includes persons, organizations and locations as entities. Just the name of a person, for example, does not indicate all possible relations it could participate in. Thus, it would be good if the authors evaluated GloVe + attention only on TACRED as well. In this setting, I would expect that the impact of the position encodings and the named entity embeddings increases a lot and would be much higher than the impact of the actual entity embeddings.\nThe authors repeatedly claim that their results are interpretable and write that they find it ""exciting"" that their results are good but it would be better if the authors could quantify whether their approach only works because ELMo already encodes the relation context within the embeddings for the entities, and if the attention weights are assigned to some words because of the entity embeddings or because of the position or named entity embeddings.\nAnother side note on interpretability: ELMo is a bidirectional RNN model, thus the authors actually use a bidirectional RNN + attention, which is not easier interpretable than other neural networks with attention (since the authors only analyze the attention weights but not the embeddings from the bidirectional RNN model) or even CNNs without attention (from which it is also possible to extract the pooling results).\n\n(2) engineering: The paper does not include any technical contribution. Instead, it seems to be the result of a lot of engineering effort, such as reducing the transformer architecture to something that worked for them, adding and tuning a lot of different regularization techniques, adding named entity information to one of their datasets (without an ablation study), adding class weights also to only one of their datasets (without an ablation study), etc. Moreover, it is not clear how the authors tune the hyperparameters (listed in the appendix) on the SemEval dataset since they mention that they do not use a development set.\n\nAdditional comments:\n- Are the relative positions in Equation 2 fed into an embedding layer? If not, this means that these values can get very large for long contexts which might affect the neural network negatively.\n- ""slot filling"" is NOT ""relation classification"" (see introduction): relation classification is: ""find r in r(e1,e2)"" while slot filling is: ""find e2 in r(e1,e2)""\n- In 2.1 it should be ""defining a relation mention to start at ..."" instead of ""defining an entity mention...""\n- There are several typos, grammar mistakes and format issues: some examples: ""paramteer-free"", ""ensmeble"", figures not readable without color, ""if we would want"", tables too wide, wrong format of words in equations, etc.', 'rating': '3: Clear rejection', 'confidence': '5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature'}"		S1xlgbcT6X	SJgDZJ1aZV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper19/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper19/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	S1xlgbcT6X	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper19/AnonReviewer1']	1546608382531		1547662981653	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Such an additional information is extracted via a neural architecture inspired by the transformer, using multihead attention using the two entities as queries and the context as keys and values. The context and entity representations are computed via ELMo embeddings. The proposed approach achieves SOTA results on two relation extraction benchmarks, namely SemEval-2010 and TAC. Furthermore, authors show that the model can provide some sort of  explanations, in terms of attention masks.

The method is tested on the SemEval2018 and TACRED datasets yielding competitive results with prior work. \n\nThe experiments are interesting, though of limited substance and do not fully support the claims made in this manuscript. In particular, the hypothesis of attention mass falling on dependency paths is not quantitatively tested at all. The writing is at points imprecise or unclear -- see comments below.\n\nFurthermore, there appears generally to be only limited novelty in the proposed method.

It is too weak to stand as a justification, and not fully convincing. Has this been shown? A reference would be useful.\n\n- ""We find it exciting that these patterns emerge from learning supervised relation classification."" -- \nIn fact, the second example (Figure 6) you give does not quite support this. I disagree with the claim that ""the two tokens paid attention to the most (”died” and ”February”) describe the relation [”per:date of death""] very accurately"", since a) the token ""dissident"" receives a similar amount of attention to ""February"", and b) ""February"" does not define the relation type.\n\n""In comparison to RNNs, especially their gated, deep and bidirectional version, we do not have long, incomprehensible information flow.""  -- I do not believe this to be quite true, since you are using ELmo representations, which stem from precisely that: bidirectional gated RNNs. Not continuing to train the parameters of these also does not change this.\n\n- Elmo representations do already include context information, so attributing the classification decision to individual tokens via their assigned attention weights has to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n- Table 1 -- Is this difference significant? 2.7K test samples is only a limited size (although there exist smaller test sets), yet the numbers are relatively close. I suggest running, for example, a t-test.\n\n- Unclear writing: ""We think that a bidirectional LSTM on top of ELMo embeddings (which are produced by bidirectional LSTMs too) can not extract much more information which it could not have learned by training it on GloVe embeddings in the first place.""\n\n- page 10: initially unclear/ambiguous what is meant by ""the heads of the entites"", only becomes clear in the last line before 4.3\n\n- Equation 7: Surely there is a simpler way of stating that mathematical expression with one numerator and one denominator?\n\n- Table 3: Improvement in F1 may be due to better balance of precision and recall. It is speculated that this has to do with the way of setting class weights. Removing this would then be an interesting side experiment, and would help understand if this is where the F1 improvement comes from, or from the other model components.\n\n- ""we completely move away from tedious feature engineering"" -- while I agree with the general point, this statement is not fully true, given that NE information is used (which is even acknowledged).\n\n- Regarding interpretability -- how does the method add something new compared to standard biLSTM+attention? Previous approaches have also used attention weights for interpretation.\n\n- The ""evidence"" for what the model is paying attention to consists in 2 (randomly picked?) examples. This is far from being substantial enough to support the claims made in the paper about the focus on shortest dependency path. I do however believe this to be an interesting hypothesis. Can this be quantified? Can this then be computed for more than 2 examples and put to the test? \n\n- ""we achieve State of the Art results on two established benchmarks in relation classification."" -- This is not immediately obvious.

The authors seem to be unaware of a growing body of recent work in biomedical machine reading using indirect supervision, e.g., Deep Probabilistic Logic (EMNLP-18). These methods have demonstrated success in extracting biomedical relations across sentences and beyond abstracts, using zero labeled examples. Likewise, in discussing semi-supervised approaches and cross-view learning, the authors should discuss their obvious connections to recent progress such as Semi-Supervised Sequential Modeling with Cross-View Learning (EMNLP-18) and EZLearn (IJCAI-18).\n\nAdditionally, the authors seem to pitch the proposed method against standard weak supervision approaches. E.g., the paper stated ""For the creation of the weak labels, we use classifiers pretrained in a small labeled dataset, instead of large Knowledge Bases which might be unavailable."" Effectively, the authors implied that distant supervision is not applicable here because it requires ""large knowledge bases"". In fact, the precise attraction of distant supervision is that knowledge bases are generally available for the relations of value, even though their coverage is sparse and not up-to-date. And past work has shown success with small KBs using distant supervision, such as recent work in precision oncology:\n\t- Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction beyond the Sentence Boundary (EACL-17)\n\t- Cross-Sentence N-ary Relation Extraction with Graph LSTMs (TACL-17)\n\nA labeled dataset contains strictly more information than the annotated relations, and arguably is harder to obtain than the corresponding knowledge base. Some prior work even simulated distant supervision scenarios from labeled datasets, e.g., DISTANT SUPERVISION FOR CANCER PATHWAY EXTRACTION FROM TEXT (PSB-15). These won\'t detract significance in exploring ensemble learning, but the proposed direction should be considered as complementary rather than competing with standard weak supervision approaches.\n\nThe paper should also discuss related datasets and resources other than BioCreative. E.g., BioNLP Shared Task on event extraction (Kim et al. 2009) is influential in biomedical relation extraction, followed by a number of shared tasks in the same space.\n\nAnother major area that can be improved is the technical and experimental details. E.g.:\n\nThe ensemble of base learners is key to the proposed method. But it\'s unclear from the paper how many base learners have been considered, what are their types, etc. At the high level, the paper should specify the total number of candidate base learners, distribution over major types (SVM, NN, ...), the types of chosen centroids, etc. For each type, the paper should include details about the variation, perhaps in supplement. E.g., SVM kernels, NN architectures. \n\nTable 3 shows the mean F1 score of base learners, which raises a number of questions. E.g., what\'re the top and bottom performers and their scores? If the mean is 53, that means some base learner learning from partial training set performs similar to LSTM learning from the whole training set, so it seems that out right some learner (supposedly not LSTM) is more suited for this domain? It\'s unclear whether LSTM is included in the base learner. If it was, then its low performance would mean that some top performers are even higher, so the ensemble gain could simply stem from their superiority. In any case, the lack of details makes it very hard to assess what\'s really going on in the experiment.\n\nA key point in the paper is that high-capacity methods such as LSTM suffers from small dataset. While in general this could be true, the LSTM in use seems to be severely handicapped. For one, the paper suggested that they undersampled in training LSTM, which means that LSTM was actually trained using less data compared to others. They did this for imbalance, but it is probably unnecessary. LSTMs are generally less sensitive to label imbalance. And if one really has to correct for that, reweighting instances is a better option given the concern about small training set to begin with.\n\nThe paper also didn\'t mention how the word embedding was initialized in LSTM. If they\'re randomly initialized, that\'s another obvious handicap the LSTM suffers from. There are publicly available PubMed word2vec embedding, not to more recent approaches like Elmo/Bert. \n\nMinor comments:\n\nIn Table 3, what does it mean by ""F1 of weak labels""? Does it mean that at test time, one compute the ensemble of predictions from base learners?\n\nThe paper uses D_G in one place and D_B in another. Might be useful to be consistent.\n\n""Text trimming"" sounds quite odd. What the paragraph describes is just standard feature engineering (i.e., taking n-grams from whole text vs. in between two entities).\n\nFig 3: it\'s unclear which line is which from the graph/caption. One has to guess from the analysis, \n\nFig 5: what was used in tSNE? I.e., how is each instance represented?

Is there a rationale for this? In particular, Sayyadi et al. (2009) and Melvin et al.

811	1547018267379	"{'title': 'Elegant Method, Neat Result, Manuscript Needs Major Reorganization ', 'review': 'This paper presents a simple model for representing lexical relations as vectors given pre-trained word embeddings.\n\nAlthough the paper only evaluates on out-of-context lexical benchmarks, as do several other papers in lexical-semantics, the empirical results are very encouraging. The proposed method achieves a substantial gain over existing supervised and unsupervised methods of the same family, i.e. that rely only on pre-trained word embeddings as inputs.\n\nIn my view, the main innovation behind this method is in the novel loss function. Rather than using just a single word pair and training it to predict the relation label, the authors propose using *pairs of word pairs* as the instance, and predicting whether both pairs are of the same relation or not. This creates a quadratic amount of examples, and also decouples the model from any schema of pre-defined relations; the model is basically forced to learn a general notion of similarity between relation vectors. I think it is a shame that the loss function is described as a bit of an afterthought in Section 4.4. I urge the authors to lead with a clear and well-motivated description of the loss function in Section 3, and highlight it as the main modeling contribution.\n\nI think it would greatly strengthen the paper to go beyond the lexical benchmarks and show whether the learned relation vectors can help in downstream tasks, such as QA/NLI, as done in pair2vec (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08854). This comment is true for every paper in lexical semantics, not only this one in particular.\n\nIt would also be nice to have an empirical comparison to pattern-based methods, e.g. Vered Shwartz\'s line of work, the recent papers by Washio and Kato from NAACL 2018 and EMNLP 2018, or the recently-proposed pair2vec by Joshi et al (although this last one was probably published at the same time that this paper was submitted). The proposed method doesn\'t need to be necessarily better than pattern-based methods, as long as the fundamental differences between the methods are clearly explained. I think it would still be a really exciting result to show that you can get close to pattern-based performance without pattern information.\n\nMy main concern with the current form of the paper is that it is written in an extremely convoluted and verbose manner, whereas the underlying idea is actually really simple and elegant. For example, in Section 3, there\'s really no reason to use so many words to describe something as standard as an MLP. I think that if the authors try to rewrite the paper with the equivalent space as an ACL short (around 6-7 pages in AKBC format), it would make the paper much more readable and to-the-point. As mentioned earlier, I strongly advise placing more emphasis on the new loss function and presenting it as the core contribution.\n\nMinor comment: Section 2.2 describes in great detail the limitation of unsupervised approaches for analogies. While this explanation is good, it does not properly credit ""Linguistic Regularities in Sparse and Explicit Word Representations"" (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) for identifying the connection between vector differences and similarity differences. For example, the term 3CosAdd was actually coined in that paper, and not in the original (Mikolov, Yih, and Zweig; 2013) paper, in order to explain the connection between adding/subtracting vectors and adding/subtracting cosine similarities. The interpretation of PairDiff as a function of word similarities (as presented in 2.2) is very natural given Levy and Goldberg\'s observation.\n', 'rating': '7: Good paper, accept', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		r1e3WW5aTX	rklXmgmXMV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper30/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper30/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	r1e3WW5aTX	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper30/AnonReviewer1']	1547018267379		1547662974440	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The GraphIE model proposed in this paper can be viewed as a natural generalization of the SeqIE model, by augmenting the original features with the long-distance information propagated through the graph structure.\n\nOn the other hand, while the paper demonstrates the superiority of GraphIE over SeqIE, it nevertheless lacks some analysis to present solid evidence on whether the particular graph structures are truly the main source of improvement.  Specifically, since GraphIE generalizes SeqIE, it is not surprising that the performance is better.  However, because of differences are not huge, there could be possibly different explanations on why the proposed method ""works"" and whether some model design choices are actually important or needed.  Some examples of analysis include:\n\n\t• Trivial feature augmentation\n\t\n\tBecause in the experiments, GCN only uses 1 or 2 layers, which means that only information from the linked node, or its immediate neighbors are passed. This suggests a simple baseline, which is just to use the original embeddings of these nodes (without the GCN layers) in the SeqIE model.  The results can shed some light on whether a formal graph convolution and the additional parameters are required, or it\'s more important to pass some information from the legitimate long-distance chains.\n\t\n\t• Random connections\n\n\tA common question on the performance gain from a more complex neural model is whether it\'s primely due to a bigger model.  One baseline to test this hypothesis is to use a somewhat random graph structure.  For instance, instead of following the obvious connections, try to construct the graph with roughly the same density, but randomly.  While personally I don\'t expect it to work, it will be nevertheless interesting to see the results.\n\nOther comments:\n\n\t1. Some of the model decision choices are not justified\n\t\t• At the end of Sec. 4.1, the sentence embedding is created using the average hidden vectors.  Why didn\'t you use the concatenation of the vectors from both ends of BiLSTM as commonly done?\n\t\t• Sec. 4.3, why did you split the GCN vectors instead of providing it directly as input for both forward and backword LSTMs?\n\n\t2. Sec. 6.3 Generalization, I feel this part is not described clearly.  What do you mean by template exactly?\n\n\t3.

820	1547073550856	"{'title': 'This paper proposes a belief propagation approach for knowledge graph construction. Specifically, the paper models event/entity extraction via a factor graph and applied belief propagation for inference. The approach is able to model uncertainty in grounding by considering distributions as variables. Most interestingly, the approach can bias extraction results by assigning higher confidence to some documents than others.', 'review': 'The motivation for the paper is well articulated: in scenarios where we extract knowledge from different documents with multiple possibly conflicting interpretations, we would like to propagate the uncertainty to the end-user applications instead of  performing maximum a posteriori inference selecting only one interpretation. \n\nThe problem definition is important and I believe I have not seen much work along these lines, so the problem statement is novel IMHO.\n\nThe ""trick"" applied that took me some while to understand is that variables in the factor graph are actually distributions rather than variables ranging over sets of entities. The authors could have made this much clearer in my opinion. I think this very basic idea is hidden behind the ""en passant"" note on page 4 that they use open sets as values for variables. So variables encode distributions and thus uncertainty. This is quite an important point that I practically missed in the first reading of the paper. \n\nIf this understanding is correct, then I find Figure 4 misleading. In particular, I do not understand why observation 1 is connected via the factor to three variables where each of these variables corresponds to a distribution. This is really unclear to me. I would have expected that the observation is connected to one variables that encodes the distribution over entities. But the figure seems to suggest otherwise. Figure 4 seems to suggest that P1 stands for Truck 1, P2 for truck 2 and T for a maximal uncertainty in which truck if could be. T seems to represent thus the uniform distribution, the others, P1 and P2 represent specific choices of truck 1 and truck 2. \n\nIf variables represent distributions, how many variables are there actually for each observation? Is the number of variable bound.\n\nThe approach works as follows: it uses preprocessing to determine the relevant candidates in a sentence and then instantiates a factor graph with corresponding variables where each of the variables stands for a distribution over entities of the corresponding type. This process is what the authors call ""grounding"". Actually, it is inference, unless with grounding they mean actually ""rolling"" out the factor graph. The terminology is quite unclear and misleading I find here. \n\nI understand that inference is performed using belief propagation. First of all, the authors mention that they graphs are loop-free. However, I do not see really why this would be the case. This would served some further explanation. Further, I do not see how exact inference can be tractable as there is an infinite number of possible distributions. There is some discretization involved, but this is not mentioned. \n\nGiven the doubts I have about how the model works, it was difficult for me to understand how the source reliability and mention uncertainty are really modeled, so I have to pass here and hope that other reviewers got this right. \n\nThe evaluation shows that the approach delivers good results, but does not compare the results to other state-of-the-art approaches. I was puzzled by the fact that the authors only provide Precision and Recall figures, but no F-Measures. Why is this the case? The results simulating the biases in Table 4 are interesting, but I wondered why the results do not come even close to the results in Table 2. \n\nIn general, the approach is interesting and promising, but large parts of the paper are imprecise, do not introduce properly the relevant notions, use non-standard terminology and obfuscate/omit important details. A factor graph is not described properly. The type of factors is not defined. One can assume that standard log-linear factors are used as in most works. But it is not made clear.\n\nOne example, on page 6 the authors say ""LEAPFROG has several common observation models with pre-built factors and local functions"". This means that LEAPFROG uses standard models that are independent of the actual model. Fair enough. But the models need to be described properly. \n\nWhat I found inappropriate are the unwarranted and unjustified claims about how people infer interpretations, e.g.  ""People often tend to stick to their existing belief regarding an interpretation unless a compelling evidence causes them to change it"". There are other unjustified claims along these lines in the people about human inference and interpretation abilities.\n\nOverall, the paper needs to be substantially improved along the lines mentioned above before it can be accepted at any conference.', 'rating': '5: Marginally below acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper'}"		SJeHzZqapm	BkeDfugVMN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper34/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	SJeHzZqapm	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper34/AnonReviewer2']	1547073550856		1547662972058	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

Technique-wise, this work is a bit hard to follow. For instance, the basic definitions, e.g., the definitions of “mentions”, “events”, “attributes” and “relations”, are not clearly given. As a result, it can become confusing when the construction details are elaborated. More confusions can be found in the detailed points.\n2.

What is the difference between this work and Pujara’s works?\n3. The experiment is comparatively weak since there is no baseline or competitors. Plus, the scale of the dataset is relatively small as far as a normal KG is concerned. In consequence, it is hard to judge whether this method can achieve superior results on this problem.\n\nDetailed Points:\n1. What is the exact difference between “relation” and “event” in this work? It seems that much more emphasis is laid on “events”, while “relations” are barely mentioned.\n2. In the subsection “Event and Relation Grounding”, it is said that “Across multiple documents, such a heuristic adds irrelevant candidates so we add a more restrictive constraint by having candidates match at least the patient argument”. Why is this approach effective and why should “patient argument”, instead of “instrument argument” be required?\n3. In the subsection “Event and Relation Grounding”, it is said that “In our domain, relations usually encode affiliations and location hierarchy, so the arguments can be considered to have a parent-child analogy”. What about broader scenarios?\n4. In the “Factors” subsection of Section 2.3, the given example seems not to be matched with Fig.4. In the description, the “variables” connected by the factor are obs.name, obs.affiliation and obs.target, while they become T, P1, P2 in the Figure.

For instance, in the second line of page 10, we “don’t” might as well be changed to “we do not”.\n6. Are there any measures to control the error propagations?

834	1546952201205	{'title': 'interesting direction but both the results and motivation are not very convincing', 'review': 'The general idea of using Bayesian modelling for link prediction is not as new, and the discussion of related work does not seem to be quite adequate.\nThe authors should contrast their approach with previous work rather than simply mentioning a small subset of the work and saying that their proposal is different. Variatonal mean field methods haven been studied actively in this context (e.g., Nakajima and Sugiyama, 2011). Blackbox VI / reparametrization trick has also been used in the related word embedding context (see, e.g., Brazinskas et al (2017)).  Bayesian versions of tensor factorization have also been proposed, e.g., Nakajima (2012) and  Zhang, Salwen, Glass, Giles, (EMNLP 2014). It needs to be clear what the differences between then proposal and the previous work are.\n \n\nUnfortunately, the paper and the approach is in many respects counter-intuitive / ad-hoc. E.g., an embedding for each entity is drawn from its own prior (i.e. from a distribution with hyper-parameters specific to each entity or each relation), the corresponding hyperparameters are estimated from data (i.e. empirical Bayes). E.g., the prior distribution for the entity USA will end up different from that of UK and then only a single vector will be drawn from each prior (e.g., an embedding for the USA will be drawn from the prior for the USA and the embedding for UK from the prior for UK). Using EM with single-sample-per-paramterized-prior is an unorthodox choice which would generally result in degenerate solutions (the prior will simply match the posterior). It does not happen here as they use a specific restricted type of priors. These priors are not flexible enough as their mode is fixed (centred Gaussians), so they could not only match if the posterior modes are left at 0. With more flexible priors (interestingly more appropriate from the modelling perspective!) the method would have failed.  This construction is different from what has been done in BMFs / TMFs where the priors are normally shared across entities (or at least entities of the same type).\n\nThe actually used method is a pipeline: MAP (stage 1) -> VMF to determine hyperparamters (stage 2) -> MAP with new hyperparamters (stage 3). It is not clear how the hyperparameters are set in the first MAP iteration.  Given that Bayesian modelling is not used, I do not understand why the authors claim that they “keep track of parameter uncertainty”. In the end their approach is not Bayesian.  (See “we argue that the parameter uncertainty in knowledge graph embedding models can be significant, calling for a Bayesian approach”). \n\nThe empirical results are somewhat mixed as the improvements from using the method are not particularly impressive. However, the improvement for DistMult seem more convincing. However, I was confused by the statement (in Table 1) that the parameters of the ComplEx baseline are tasks from the Lacroix paper, whereas nothing was said about DistMult. Does it imply that the DistMult model is less tuned? What hyperparameters do the authors refer to? Does it include frequency based weighting of the regularizer? Has frequency based weighting been used for Complex only, not DistMult? \n\nI am not entirely sure that their claim that their approach is a simpler alternative to previous parameter selection methods is well supported. E.g., the cited method of Lacroix et al. relies on frequency and does not seem any harder to tune.\n\nIt may seem surprising that the VMF method alone (i.e. stage 2) is less effective than the pipeline. The authors mention it only in conclusions (should really be mentioned earlier, together with extra discussion / analysis). Whereas one may have expected that the improvements from Bayesian modelling should be greater for less frequent entities / relations, a degradation in performance (rather than the lack of significant improvement) for frequent entities probably points to some problems of the model. Why would it then work within a pipeline? I guess the reason is that the posteriors for infrequent entities will have large variances (essentially the effect of the entropy term) -> hence the prior dispersion parameters will also decrease with frequency (in average) -> hence the terms with higher frequency will be more heavily regularised. This matches the recipe of Lacroix et al / Serbs & Salakutdinov et al. The hope is that there is more to it than simply following this recipe. As far as I understand, the ComplEx baseline has already used the frequency-based weights so some improvements over this baseline may suggested that the induced weighting is more appropriate. However, I am not sure if the DistMult baseline has already used them (unclear).\n\nThe initialisation for stage 1 (the first iteration MAP) is not described. How sensitive the model was to the initialization? If the initialization of the dispersion parameters is uniform (and the regularisation is sufficiently strong), I could image that it would result in small variance for the variational paraders for infrequent items and potentially break the method? Or, does it only slows down inference?\n\nWhat are termination conditions? How is T chosen? Has the method actually converged?\n\nOverall, the paper has not convinced me that this approach is well motivated and less brittle than previous alternatives. There are just too many aspects which seem ad-hoc, and not properly discussed / motivated in the submission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'rating': '5: Marginally below acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}		rylPm-5a67	Byl-M0GfzV	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper40/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper40/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	3		['everyone']	rylPm-5a67	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper40/AnonReviewer3']	1546952201205		1547662968483	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

It also proposes a deterministic algorithm for answering WSC problems based on the representation chosen for the statement and knowledge. For background, the WSC contains statements such as “The man could not lift his son because he was so weak.” with the question being to resolve the pronoun to its correct reference. Correctly resolving the pronoun requires world knowledge; to resolve ‘he’ in the example above, one needs to know that if a person is weak they might not be able to lift something. Wrongly resolving the pronoun to the son in the example would entail that things that are weak cannot be lifted. \n\nThe paper uses the representation produced by the K-parser [Sharma et al. 2015] to represent the input statement, which parses the statement into a directed acyclic graph which action (verbs), entity (nouns), property (adjectives), etc. nodes. Based on this representation, the paper identifies 12 different categories of knowledge required to solve the WSC problems. For example, A knowledge category is “Property prevents Action” whose instantiation is weak person ‘prevents’ person lifts. Apart from similar categories to these, correlation amongst actions and properties is needed, and knowing whether a statement is more likely than another statement. \nThe paper proposes a deterministic algorithm to answer WSC problems by using the K-parser representation and the required knowledge. \n\nOf the 12 different categories of knowledge required identified in the paper, the proposed method can only handle 10 of those. It cannot handle problems that require knowing when a statement is more likely than another statement, or when a problem requires multiple different kinds of knowledge. Another limitation of the proposed approach is, of the 10 types that can be handled, all of them require knowledge in similar propositional form, ‘sentence1 predicate sentence2’. For example, ‘action causes property’, ‘action1 follows action2’. These limitations seem prohibitive. Empirically the paper finds that only 69% of the problems in the Definite Pronoun Resolution (DPR) Dataset can be solved if only the top categories of knowledge are used. It would have been useful if other question-answering datasets, or coreference resolution datasets are analyzed together to form a comprehensive categorization of required knowledge to improve coverage across problems and datasets.\n\nAnother major limitation of the proposed approach is the semantic representation used (K-parser). The semantic representation produced by the K-parser is not error-free and requires identifying non-trivial semantic relations. For example, identifying ‘weak’ is a ‘trait’ of ‘he’. The limitations of the closed class of semantic relations used is not discussed in the paper. Empirically, 18% of the problems solvable in the DPR are incorrectly answered due to parser errors.

The knowledge in these patterns is represented as a (dependency) graph, relying on the same representation used for representing the sentence and question.\n\nIt is also good to see an algorithm proposed to ingest these knowledge pieces to determine the answer to a problem from the Winograd challenge. The algorithm essentially merges a dependency / graph representation of a sentence and question with the background knowledge in the form of patterns and performs a number of merging operations until the question pronoun in the question is resolved to some entity in the text. The answer retrieval is implemented using Answer Set Programming. \nK-Parser is used to translate natural language text into graphical representations.\n\nThe evaluation shows that the 12 knowledge types can ""cover"" all examples from the Winograd challenge and 82% in the DPR dataset. It is unclear to me here if the authors really mean here that their algorithm found the correct solution in 100% of the cases for the Winograd dataset given the hard-coded knowledge.\n\nWhile the main focus of the paper is not on automatically inducing the knowledge in question, they perform a small experiment testing in how many cases they find sentences containing the knowledge in a larger corpus. They success to find relevant sentences in 100 out of 161 problems for the Winograd dataset; this is a promising result.\n\nWhat I found quite cumbersome and in need for improvement is the description of the ""reasoning algorithm"" that essentially merges representation. The procedure as it is describe looks a bit adhoc. I was wondering if the authors instead could describe the underlying principles that are applied for merging. As it stands, the procedure is hard to trace and to understand. \n\nOverall, this is an interesting paper sheding light on types of knowledge that could play a role in more challenging machine reading tasks.\n', 'rating': '6: Marginally above acceptance threshold', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		r1gyNZ9Tam	ryxFxMlEGE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper43/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	r1gyNZ9Tam	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper43/AnonReviewer3']	1547071984867		1547662967093	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

In particular, given the unavoidable information loss when transforming text into fixed-relation triples, keeping KBs open is often desirable - predicting links in such open KBs then is an interesting challenge.\n\nThe paper provides a solid contribution in terms of discussion of related work, 2 benchmark datasets, and the evaluation of several baselines. It is also generally well-written and free of typos.\n\nMy concerns are mainly on three points: 1) I have issues understanding the evaluation methodology, 2) a technical concern about the datasets, and 3) the qualitative evaluation of the results is very brief, limiting insights on whether the datasets and results are useful or not. I believe that addressing 2) and 3) could greatly increase the impact of the paper.\n\n1) Methodology:\n(Disclaimer: I am no expert in embedding models) It is not clear to me how the link prediction is performed technically - can the embeddings in Figure 1 be inverted (from embeddings back to surface text)? As I naively understand classical embedding models, one would take embeddings of subject and predicate, apply a transformation, then output those entities as candidate objects whose embeddings are closest in embedding space to subject+predicate (or more complex transformations). Given the unrestricted nature of open surface forms, I don\'t see how now to ""search"" for embeddings of entities near subject+object. Or are you iteratively testing the distance to the embeddings of all entities of the open KB (but in this way, there would be no way to predict new entities/surface forms as objects)? I would appreciate a clarification/walk-trhough how top-k predictions are computed for a given test triple.\n\n2) The dataset description is a bit unclear, what exactly does each dataset consist of, and what is extracted from it? In some way a set of synonymous entity mentions (paraphrases) is computed? I would suggest to make the components of the datasets more formal (e.g., ""each dataset is a tuple of ...""). Also, treating different mentions as paraphrases appears somewhat in conflict with an argument made on the top of page 7 - that different mentions carry semantically interesting information. I imagine that could also play a role at the prediction stage - if (Senator Obama, worked for Bill Clinton), but ""President Obama"" did not, can this be modelled?\n\n3) The qualitative evaluation of the results is rather unsatisfactory and does not allow me to judge what happens. There are still 2.5 pages of space so that should be easy to address. The only example, professors at Princeton, cannot be intuitively understood (probably not even by people at Princeton). I\'d suggest to add several examples about known topics, e.g., movies by Tarantino, states of the US, Italian dishes, or something similar that allows an intuitive understanding.\nAlso, I would greatly appreciate examples that show which influence variations in subjects or predicates have - are predictions for (Trump, visited, x) different from (President Trump, often visited), (Donald Trump, has been to), and so on. \n\nMinor comments\n - Capitalization of systems please check, e.g., ""WikiPedia"", ""DBPedia"", ""freebase""\n - Notation is a bit cumbersome. Why are there letters i, j, k, additionally head entities, tail entities? Why not intuitive s, p, o? Being in the head of a triple is not a property of an entity, just a role - entities can appear both in the subject and object position, so the distinction between ""head entities"" and ""tail entities"" appears incorrect.\n - last paragraph of Section 2: Add ""and k is a paraphrase of r""\n - ""as representative of such models"" - before 3 categories are introduced, clarify whether this is a representative of all 3 categories?\n - ""an KG"" -> ""a""\n - ""filtered setting"" is unclear to me\n - what is an ""oracle link function""?\n - ""a state of the art model which ..."" - state of the art for which task?\n - ""gold annotation for entity links"" - what are ""entity links""?', 'rating': '7: Good paper, accept', 'confidence': '3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct'}"		HJl_NZ5T67	HJxSY6ISgE	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper46/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper46/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	HJl_NZ5T67	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper46/AnonReviewer2']	1545067901175		1547662965984	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

The results on TAC dataset are very strong, in most cases improving on the state of the art. However, the positioning of the proposed approach with respect to the literature and the description of the algorithm is rather confusing, thus it is difficult to assess the novelty and contributions made. Here are a few points for the authors to consider in revising their work:\n\n- generative adversartial imitation learning is a framework proposed by Ho and Ermon, as cited. They propose an algorithm to optimize the objective defined using trust region policy optimization, however the approach proposed  in this paper does not follow that algorithm. Is there a reason for this? Assuming the approach was named as it followed the work of Ho and Ermon, it would make sense to explain and justify the deviations from it. GAIL in the original paper does not assume access to an expert for supervision, but the algorithm proposed here does, so there are substantial differences.\n\n- the approach proposed is also referred to in the title as end to end. However, there are two separate training steps: one with Q learning for trigger extraction and one for argument detection trained with policy gradient.\n\n- in GAN training, the generator creates datapoints and the discriminator classifies them. However here we have a classifier (a set of them to be precise) that predict the labels for entities and triggers and the arguments, and an extractor that assigns rewards, a regressor. I think this is much more similar to the actor-critic approaches, see here for example: https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07086\n\n- the argument prediction is modeled as independent classification steps. What's the reason to use an RL algorithm such as policy gradient? Cost sensitive classification is well studied, see: https://cling.csd.uwo.ca/papers/cost_sensitive.pdf and the motivation is often to address class imbalance\n\n- for the entity and trigger tagging, the natural baseline is to apply CRF-biLSTM style approaches, e.g. : https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1030\nIt takes into account context from the whole sentence as well as the actions themselves. As far as I understand the paper proposes a different training objective from cross entropy in equation 5, however the loss there is not defined with respect to the gold standard so it hard to follow.\n\nOn the whole, while the results presented are very strong, at the same time I can't understand the approach even though I went through the relevant literature and I consider myself rather familiar with the topic."", 'rating': '4: Ok but not good enough - rejection', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		BJlsVZ966m	HJx_vdORbN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper47/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper47/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	1		['everyone']	BJlsVZ966m	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper47/AnonReviewer3']	1546713184371		1547662965503	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']
848	1546874334292	"{'title': 'Slightly flawed idea with confusing descriptions. ', 'review': 'The paper introduces generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) for event and argument extraction. A discriminator is trained to distinguish between gold labels and system predicted labels to estimate rewards given to the extractor for its predictions during training. The general idea of the paper is unfortunately flawed as the task of event extraction is not a suitable setup for GAIL, at least how the paper presents it. Please find detailed comments in the following. Furthermore, the writing is quite confusing and it is hard to follow especially the methods section. The results are surprisingly good, however, the paper lacks theoretical justification for why this is the case. Finally, a proper baseline is missing, that is using the same model with standard supervised learning and teacher forcing. Therefore, I cannot recommend this paper for acceptance. \n\n==Concerning RL==\nI have trouble with how the paper presents the used techniques. This is not a classical RL setup and I am not sure that using Q-Learning for sequence labeling is all that useful if not compared to the standard way of doing things which is to use the gold labels during training as input to the unidirecitonal LSTM and train using cross-entropy (teacher forcing). Argument role prediction is also not really an RL problem. Calling this policy gradient is confusing because in RL there is usually no direct supervision over the policy but only a reward the comes from an environment. The formulation here is thus very artificial.\n\n==Concerning GAIL==\nI like the idea of having dynamic rewards or losses. However, there is something very strange going on in this setup. If the discriminator can better estimate what a good reward is than the extractor given a state and a label, why can we not use the discriminator to predict the correct label in the first place? In fact the extractor will learn exactly the same behaviour as the discriminator which is trained on the actual task as it learns to score gold labels higher than labels predicted by the system, that is, if the system is wrong. This would only make sense if computing D(a,s) for all a is not feasible, ie. the action space is too large. However, it is not too large in this case. I am quite concerned by this but the paper doesn\'t offer any answers as to why the extractor should be better than the discriminator and why such a training should be at all better than normal supervised learning. I believe that this might be due to the ranking loss of D and the way the extractor is used to sample negative examples for ranking. A possible scenario where it makes sense would be if the extractor was trained on unlabeled data. Maybe it also makes sense in case past actions are actually used to compute future states and affect does future actions to discount for the fact that past actions may have caused false future actions. But there is a clear lack of evidence in the paper that this is really the case.\n\nSuggestions:\nIn my opinion the paper needs to tone down the RL part and instead focus on adopting ideas from inverse RL and GAIL to scale standard supervised losses dynamically. This, however, requires a theoretical justification why it should be better than teacher forcing and unscaled cross-entropy loss, which needs to be the baseline.\n\n\nComments and questions:\n\n- notation could be clearer, e.g., v_t_tr v_t_ar, the extra \'t\' is confusing\n- unecessarily complicated notation and description of method\n- many confusing formulations: e.g.: \n-- ""In event extraction task, entity, event and argument role labels yield to a complex structure with variant difficulties.""\n-- ""Equation 12 reveals a scenario of adversary between ground truth and extractor and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) [Ho and Ermon, 2016], which is based on GAN [Goodfellow et al., 2014], fits such adversarial nature.""\n- why scaling the reward with alpha? Why use sigmoid and not tanh for the reward coming from function D(s,a)?\n- why using 5 and -5 as reward? When you use -0.1 and 0.1 as thresholds for the dynamic reward model, why don\'t you use this as a fixed threshold?\n- how are the ""actions"" used in the future? Are they fed into the uni-directional LSTM at the top of Figure 2? This is not clear from text or image. If actions are not used as additional input, then this is not RL because the actions taken wouldn\'t affect the future states.\n-- If actions are taken into consideration I would like to see a baseline with teacher forcing, where the model is always given the correct label as input during training time in the uni-directional LSTM, the way it is usually done.', 'rating': '3: Clear rejection', 'confidence': '4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct'}"		BJlsVZ966m	Bye81CJbfN	AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/-/Paper47/Official_Review	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper47/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	2		['everyone']	BJlsVZ966m	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference/Paper47/AnonReviewer1']	1546874334292		1547662965278	['AKBC.ws/2019/Conference']

For a given relation in the knowledge graph, the system first finds text that is relevant to either the entities involved or the relation type. It then encodes the text by averaging the pretrained vectors for each token, and concatenates this average with a small set of binary features indicating which portions of the relation are present in the text. This encoding is then passed through a two-layer MLP, and the result of that is passed separately through a sigmoid layer to predict credibility of the relation, and a softmax layer to predict a correction for the relation type.\n\nPros:\n- The system appears to achieve good performance, but the systems used for comparisons don’t seem very strong. The numbers would be more convincing with a stronger baseline.\n\n- The task/approach is somewhat novel. Jointly modeling credibility and corrections on a standalone knowledge graph is new. However, just modeling them jointly doesn’t have much of an improvement over the independent training in the evaluation. It’s not clear to me that the approach is significantly different from a pipeline in which an information retrieval system is used to find relevant sentences which are then passed through an IE system. \n\nConcerns:\n1) Did you consider other approaches for combining the sentences? Given that a single good sentence is sufficient to indicate a relation, and the only requirements for the selected sentences are that they contain a single aspect of the relation, it seems like averaging the sentences potentially just adds noise. This appears to be supported by the “number of sentences” ablation.\n\n2) The negative sampling for wikidata could be improved. Given that the model is based on the provenance, and the provenance is randomly assigned to negative examples, it seems like the negative examples in wikidata will be easy to identify.\n\n3) The model description is not completely clear to me:\n- How are the binary features from different sentences combined?\n- Is the credibility prediction aware of the proposed relation beyond the binary features? As it’s described, the text encoding seems like it would be a very noisy signal given that it might credibly describe a relation different from the proposed one.\n\n4) I would like to see more analysis as to why shared gumbel noise has such a large impact? What kinds of problems does it fix?\n\n5) Given that the model relies pretty heavily on it, I would like to see some analysis of how strong the sentence retrieval/featurization is. Some helpful things to include might be:\n- Statistics of how many sentences are retrieved on average, and some statistics about which features are triggered on them (ie how often do you see a sentence containing both entities and triggering the relation).\n- One baseline that would be helpful would be to run a state-of-the-art IE system on the retrieved sentences (or provided provenance for TAC), and compare the output to the proposed relation.\n\n\nMinor things:\n- It’s not entirely clear to me what the outer product ablation is, or why it’s included given that it doesn’t seem to have any effect.\n- The writing is not very polished.

The paper presents heuristic methods,\na set of applications, and initial experiments. Overall, I like the approach\ntaken in this paper; it\'s a nice initial step towards AALG. However, the paper\nsuffers from a fuzzy presentation and a highly incomplete discussion of the\nexperimental study. As a consequence, key points of the paper remain somewhat\nmysterious to me and I am hesitant to recommend acceptance.\n\nPros:\nS1. Introduces adversarial attacks to KG models\nS2.

The definition of the loss function is imprecise. What is summed over? What\nabout negative sampling? This is important because the loss function is used\nlater to find attack triples.\n\nD2. The optimization problems of Sec. 3 do not aim for maximum change of the\ntarget triples as claimed. Instead, they aim to lower the score of the target\ntriple as much as possible. This is a mismatch to the motivation given in the\npaper (which should be appropriately adapted) and makes formulas unnecessarily\ncomplicated: the paper seems to solve $\\argmin \\bar \\psi(s,r,o)$.\n\nD3. The focus on fixed-object attacks appears reasonable, but is mentioned\nsomewhat late. Moreover, the ""easily expandable"" claim needs justification.\n\nD4. I found Sec. 4.1. very hard to follow. This is partly due to suboptimal\npresentation; e.g., the notation also mixes constants (i.e., optimum solutions)\nand variables (in derivatives) and is inconsistent (e.g., $\\cdot$ vs $\\times$ for dot\nproduct). The decomposition of the loss function is unclear (partly because it\'s\nnot well-defined) and needs to be spelled out. More importantly, it remains\nunclear what assumptions are really made, which surrogate function is optimized\nand how, and why this is a good choice. This crucial section needs revision and\nperhaps additional material in the appendix.\n\nD5. I do not buy the argument that the most adversarial triple for (s,r,o) is\nlikely to have the same object. I prefered if the authors just state that they\nfocus on this case or provide further justification.\n\nD6. The idea to find z_{s\',r\'} of an added triple is appealing. Due to the issues\nin 4.1, it\'s not clear how this is found though and which assumptions are made.\n\nD7. I suggest to add a study on the accuracy of the inverter network. For\nDistMult, the network probably isn\'t needed and one can use maximum\ninner-product search instead.\n\nD8. Is the effect of normalization (e.g., to unit norm) of the embeddings\nconsidered in any way?\n\nD9. The description of the experimental setup is largely missing. How have the\nmodels been trained? What was the serach grid, which hyperparameters have been\nselected and based on what criteria? How have models been retrained? From\nscratch? For how long? For how long have the AALP-methods (which are also\ngradient based) been run? Were there any hyperparameters (such as step size or\noptimizer)? If so, wow were they selected?

The influence function as well as the relationship to Koh and Liang [2017]\nshould be discussed in more detail in the main part of the paper (Sec. 4.1).\n\nD12. In Tab 6.1, what are the scores correlated to? Why are there sometimes\nsmaller and sometimes larger differences between AALP and the influence\nfunction? What are the targets? Have results been averaged in any way? Is it\nfeasible to compute the best adversarial triple on these datasets without the\nfixed-object limitation (see D5)?\n\nD13.

This is surprising, because one would expect pre-training on a massive corpus to yield substantial improvements, as seen in ELMo and BERT. Assuming that the model is indeed learning important information during pre-training, I think that adding perhaps more difficult benchmarks, such as zero-shot relation extraction (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04115), could help convince the reader that this kind of pre-training is worth the effort.\n\nI also think there is a missing experiment in 4.2 to support any claims that the proposed approach improves performance: if you combine labeled data (e.g. the kind used to train GloRE) with the proposed unsupervised approach, can we get better results than GloRE? If not, wouldn\'t that undermine the whole idea of pretraining?\n\nIn the related work, the authors write: ""To summarize, no previous work has targeted general embedding of textual relations by learning on large scale corpora.""\nI believe the authors are unaware of the work on hypernymy detection (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06076), and especially the more recent work on relation representation by Washio and Kato (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03411 & https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03401), as well as some more contemporary work (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08854). It would be great to see an empirical comparison with these papers and a discussion of their differences from the proposed approach.\n\nI also found the loss function a bit weird. In reality, there is exactly one relation that each instance refers to, and it can (theoretically) be inferred from looking at the entities as well. The model is given these entities as input, but the loss is telling the model to ignore that information, and essentially misleading it to always predict some kind of entity-oblivious average. If you have (from distant supervision) the specific Freebase relation that this particular instance refers to, why not use it as the target?\n\nMy other concerns are mainly about writing. The paper is extremely verbose, and I think much of the content could be conveyed in half the page count. There are also some specific points that need to be clarified:\n- Intro: ""However, neither of these objectives is very meaningful for textual relation embedding."" - that\'s an unbased hypothesis, which I don\'t believe is true.\n- What is GloRE? Both a citation and a quick explanation are missing.\n- What is the difference from Su et al., 2017? This needs to be made crystal clear. Under my current interpretation, it\'s (a) using transformers instead of RNNs, (b) training on ClueWeb. These differences need to be properly ablated in the paper as well.\n- What exactly are the global co-occurrence statistics?

Although being a widely-adopted approach, using cross entropy as the primary objective exploits mostly the information from the ground-truth class for maximizing data likelihood, and largely ignores information from the complement (incorrect) classes. We argue that, in addition to the primary objective, training also using a complement objective that leverages information from the complement classes can be effective in improving model performance. This motivates us to study a new training paradigm that maximizes the likelihood of the ground-truth class while neutralizing the probabilities of the complement classes.

""Minimal images"" are the smallest regions of an image that remain recognizable for humans. Ullman et al. (2016) show that a slight modification of the location and size of the visible region of the minimal image produces a sharp drop in human recognition accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that such drops in accuracy due to changes of the visible region are a common phenomenon between humans and existing state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), and are much more prominent in DNNs. We found many cases where DNNs classified one region correctly and the other incorrectly, though they only differed by one row or column of pixels, and were often bigger than the average human minimal image size. We show that this phenomenon is independent from previous works that have reported lack of invariance to minor modifications in object location in DNNs. Our results thus reveal a new failure mode of DNNs that also affects humans to a much lesser degree. They expose how fragile DNN recognition ability is in natural images even without adversarial patterns being introduced. Bringing the robustness of DNNs in natural images to the human level remains an open challenge for the community.

To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method: agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. We introduce ACD using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, in order to diagnose incorrect predictions, identify dataset bias, and extract polarizing phrases of varying lengths. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs.

In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network.

We also argue how this identity can be used in the so-called ""highly over-parameterized"" nonlinear setting (where the number of parameters far exceeds the number of data points) to provide insights into why SMD (and SGD) may have similar convergence and implicit regularization properties for deep learning.

However, at this point we were not able to achieve results with AdaShift that are comparable to or better than the results with Adam or AMSGrad and given that this is an interesting problem that is much more realistic than training a generator against a fixed discriminator that could be used to study the behavior of an optimizer, we find this experiment more useful. We note that training a discriminator against a fixed generator essentially leads to training a neural network to distinguish dataset images from noise which is a peculiar setting. We conducted experiments in two settings when training both discriminator and generator. First is the typical setting WGAN-GP with penalty coefficient equal to 10 and the second is WGAN max-GP with penalty coefficient equal to 0.1. While in the first setting we were able to train the generative model with all optimizers (albeit with AdaShift performing worse than both Adam and AMSGrad), we found that in the second setting the results are much worse for all optimizers and the generative model does not train well (we were not able to achieve Inception Score of at least 4 after 100 epochs of training). In our case making learning rate for AdaShift 10 times bigger than the learning rates of Adam and AMSGrad lead to divergence in the first setting. We also tried a number of other learning rates and again were not able to achieve results for AdaShift that are comparable to the other optimizers in the first setting. We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide further details that may lead to comparable results between different optimizers.\n', 'title': 'WGAN experiment'}		HkgTkhRcKQ	rkgAZSb9ME	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1028/Public_Comment	[]	4		['everyone']	BygUdM1fGE	['~Mikhail_Konobeev1']	1547470086161		1547470086161	['~Mikhail_Konobeev1', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

Some recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation instead when trained on 'Stylized-ImageNet', a stylized version of ImageNet. This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560 psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions, highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation."", 'keywords': ['deep learning', 'psychophysics', 'representation learning', 'object recognition', 'robustness', 'neural networks', 'data augmentation'], 'authorids': ['robert@geirhos.de', 'patricia@rubisch.net', 'claudio.michaelis@bethgelab.org', 'matthias.bethge@uni-tuebingen.de', 'felix.wichmann@uni-tuebingen.de', 'wieland.brendel@bethgelab.org'], 'authors': ['Robert Geirhos', 'Patricia Rubisch', 'Claudio Michaelis', 'Matthias Bethge', 'Felix A.

This requires the high-level semantic features should be alike among samples, despite a wide span in resolution, texture, deformation, etc. Previous works focus on re-designing the loss function or proposing new regularization constraints on the loss. In this paper, we address this problem via a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two sets in the feature space: one with more reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher’s behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the high-dimensional space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become more closer within the same category - implying that it is easilier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed the spirit into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass. We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is achieved by minimizing the distribution divergence between two sets. We design a historical buffer to represent all previous samples in the reliable set and utilize them to guide the feature learning of the less reliable set. The design of obtaining an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) algorithm into the framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with the reliable set with aid of OT metric.

Then we provide upper bounds on the number of weights and the memory size for a given approximation error bound and the bit-width of weights for function-independent and function-dependent structures.

In this work, we derive an analogous equivalence for multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) both with and without pooling layers, and achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 for GPs without trainable kernels.

Moreover, signals can exist in different topological structures as, for example, points, lines, surfaces and volumes. It has been challenging to analyze signals with mixed topologies (for example, point cloud with surface mesh). To this end, we develop mathematical formulations for Non-Uniform Fourier Transforms (NUFT) to directly, and optimally, sample nonuniform data signals of different topologies defined on a simplex mesh into the spectral domain with no spatial sampling error. The spectral transform is performed in the Euclidean space, which removes the translation ambiguity from works on the graph spectrum. Our representation has four distinct advantages: (1) the process causes no spatial sampling error during initial sampling, (2) the generality of this approach provides a unified framework for using CNNs to analyze signals of mixed topologies, (3) it allows us to leverage state-of-the-art backbone CNN architectures for effective learning without having to design a particular architecture for a particular data structure in an ad-hoc fashion, and (4) the representation allows weighted meshes where each element has a different weight (i.e., texture) indicating local properties.

Instead, we revisit the empirical analysis of heuristics through the lens of recently proposed methods for loss surface and representation analysis, viz. mode connectivity and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and hypothesize reasons why the heuristics succeed. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation and learning rate heuristics of (cosine) restarts and warmup using mode connectivity and CCA.  Our empirical analysis suggests that: (a) the reasons often quoted for the success of cosine annealing are not evidenced in practice; (b) that the effect of learning rate warmup is to prevent the deeper layers from creating training instability; and (c) that the latent knowledge shared by the teacher is primarily disbursed in the deeper layers.', 'keywords': ['deep learning heuristics', 'learning rate restarts', 'learning rate warmup', 'knowledge distillation', 'mode connectivity', 'SVCCA'], 'authorids': ['akhilesh.gotmare@epfl.ch', 'nkeskar@salesforce.com', 'cxiong@salesforce.com', 'rsocher@salesforce.com'], 'authors': ['Akhilesh Gotmare', 'Nitish Shirish Keskar', 'Caiming Xiong', 'Richard Socher'], 'TL;DR': 'We use empirical tools of mode connectivity and SVCCA to investigate neural network training heuristics of learning rate restarts, warmup and knowledge distillation.', 'pdf': '/pdf/e9289f90a3af3f458b6b8331b8080c3e5793812b.pdf', 'paperhash': 'gotmare|a_closer_look_at_deep_learning_heuristics_learning_rate_restarts_warmup_and_distillation', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\ngotmare2018a,\ntitle={A Closer Look at Deep Learning Heuristics: Learning rate restarts, Warmup and Distillation},\nauthor={Akhilesh Gotmare and Nitish Shirish Keskar and Caiming Xiong and Richard Socher},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r14EOsCqKX},\n}'}		r14EOsCqKX	r14EOsCqKX	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	347	SkxY3CPKFX	['everyone']		['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']	1538087788235		1547112924218	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

However, how to enforce the Lipschitz is currently a not well-addressed problem.

Researchers recently propose several algorithms to avoid the issue of non-convergence of Adam, but their efficiency turns out to be unsatisfactory in practice. In this paper, we provide a new insight into the non-convergence issue of Adam as well as other adaptive learning rate methods. We argue that there exists an inappropriate correlation between gradient $g_t$ and the second moment term $v_t$ in Adam ($t$ is the timestep), which results in that a large gradient is likely to have small step size while a small gradient may have a large step size. We demonstrate that such unbalanced step sizes are the fundamental cause of non-convergence of Adam, and we further prove that decorrelating $v_t$ and $g_t$ will lead to unbiased step size for each gradient, thus solving the non-convergence problem of Adam. Finally, we propose AdaShift, a novel adaptive learning rate method that decorrelates $v_t$ and $g_t$ by temporal shifting, i.e., using temporally shifted gradient $g_{t-n}$ to calculate $v_t$. The experiment results demonstrate that AdaShift is able to address the non-convergence issue of Adam, while still maintaining a competitive performance with Adam in terms of both training speed and generalization.

While we replicated the optimizer and the experiments in PyTorch, we would like to thank the authors for sharing their implementation in TensorFlow as that made verification of the results easier. Overall, our findings are close to the results from the paper and we summarize them as follows:\n\n* While the authors have not experimented with the sequential online optimization problem proposed by Reddi et al. (2018) since it did not fit their assumptions, we found that the proposed AdaShift optimizer is able to converge but is slower than AMSGrad. At the same time we also confirm the results of the experiment with a stochastic counterexample on which Adam fails.\n\n* In the logistic regression and MLP experiments on MNIST the results of all optimizers are quite similar in our experiments as well as in the paper.\n\n* We also tried to reproduce more complex experiments such as WGAN-GP and NMT. In WGAN-GP we note the atypical way in which the authors conducted their experiments with a generative model, specifically, by fixing generator and training only discriminator. We trained both discriminator and generator and in our experiments using AdaShift lead to worse Inception Score than using either Adam or AMSGrad which in turn had quite similar results. Additionally, we note that the authors set a penalty coefficient to 0.1 which is significantly different from its value in the paper that proposed this method where it was equal to 10. We also note that authors use maxGP version of the loss function in their code. In our opinion, motivation and discussion of these choices would be beneficial. At the same time for the translation model, AdaShift showed the best result which is similar to the author’s experiment and the difference from other methods is even more significant.\n\n* We found a discrepancy between the implementation of the AdaShift provided by the authors and its description in the paper: in the paper it is repeatedly stated that the result of applying the function \\phi to the gradient should be squared, while in the code the function is applied to the square of the gradient. Could you please elaborate on this?  While we found that on the synthetic and MNIST experiments both orders lead to very similar results, we think that clarification is still needed.\n', 'title': 'ICLR Reproducibility Challenge'}		HkgTkhRcKQ	BJglD8rbzV	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1028/Public_Comment	[]	3		['everyone']	HkgTkhRcKQ	['~Mikhail_Konobeev1']	1546896984506		1546896984506	['~Mikhail_Konobeev1', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

Given no available code for the project, we implemented the variational autoencoder architecture described in the paper from scratch.  We validate the experimental results and further propose improvements or future research directions that may contribute to the machine learning community. A link to the full report, as well as the repository with code, can be found at the end of this message.\n\nThe authors' main motivation for this work lies in developing a model able to learn sparse representations that are informative (for further classification tasks) and interpretable (by exploring the latent sparse space). In this line of thought, they propose an improvement over the Variational AutoEncoder model, explicitly modeling sparsity in the latent space with a Spike and Slab prior distribution and drawing ideas from sparse coding theory.\n\nOverall, the paper describes in enough detail the Variational Sparse Coding (VSC) model implementation. Only some details in the optimization hyperparameters and initialization mechanisms would be ideal. However, given enough training epochs, the VSC model we implemented was able to converge and produce the desired results in the different tasks described in the paper. \n\nFurther development on testing the model and comparing it against other sparse models on well-known benchmarks is critical. In order to assess how interpretable the learned latent features are, we could extract ideas from disentangled representations, to measure the effect of sparsity on a disentanglement metric, against benchmark models such as β-VAE or Factor-VAE. Without a proper benchmark, we are not able to understand how the learned representations can be interpretable. Although for small latent dimensions, visual inspection is enough, there must be a metric for comparison.  \n\nFinally, we suggest using convolutional architectures to obtain less blurry images and richer sparse representations. In addition, by applying the model to the Disentanglement testing Sprites dataset, we may observe and measure the interpretability of the learned latent sparse representations. \n\nWe conclude that the model hypothesis was validated through corroborating results in different experimental setups with our model implementation.

Our presentation has room for improvement and again thank you for the suggestions on this.\nFor reference, we summarise the major questions raised by the reviewers, and our answers to them.\n\n\nQ1: “prior work (Schott et al., 2018) not mentioned”\nA1: We thank the reviewers for pointing out Schott et al., (2018) which is concurrent. Our work is concurrent with Schott et al., (2018). The first version was submitted to arXiv in Feb 2018, and the previous version was presented at ICML 2018 TADGM workshop (oral) in July 2018. \n\nWe cited this paper in revision and discussed the major differences:\n1a) We performed extensive evaluation on both MNIST and CIFAR-10. Schott et al., (2018) only tested their method on MNIST and reached to similar conclusions as ours.\n1b) We investigated different graphical models for both generative and discriminative classifiers. Schott et al., (2018) only tested one architecture.\n1c) We amortized the cost of inference with a recognition network, and the importance sampling only needs K=10 latent variable samples. By contrast, Schott et al., (2018)’s model requires K=5000 samples and 50 optimisation steps to predict y for a single x.\n1d) We proposed new detection methods utilizing the learned model and evaluated their effectiveness in experiments. Schott et al., (2018) did not discuss this.\n1e) We proposed the generative-discriminative fusion model as a scalable solution to big data and big networks. Schott et al., (2018) did not discuss this.\n\nQ2: “focus on minimum perturbation distance only, and take out the whole detection part”\nA2: In revision we added visualisations and tables on the min distortion of the L_inf attacks. However:\nOur detection method is the first to make the classifier and detector use the **same generative model manifold** (as a proxy to the data manifold). This is distinct from all previous attempts, which train a **separate** generative model and thus have no guarantee to have an aligned manifold representation. Therefore previous success on attacking detection methods (Carlini & Wagner 2017, Athayle et al., 2018) do not directly transfer to our proposal, and would need to be reassessed. Our results clearly show that as the perturbation size increases, the robustness of the models naturally decreases but the detection rates increase as well. This means it is hard to fool both the classifier and the detection simultaneously.\n\n\nQ3: ""off-manifold conjecture pre-assumed""\nA3: We did not pre-assume the correctness of the ""off-manifold"" conjecture:\n3a) We were interested in verifying the ""off-manifold"" conjecture for both generative and discriminative classifiers. If for small epsilon the classifiers have high error, then this conjecture might not be true in practice.\n3b) The detection methods depend on the correctness of the ""off-manifold"" conjecture. Therefore, if empirically the detection methods don\'t work even when we have a very good generative model (which is the case for MNIST), then, this conjecture might not be true in practice. \n3c) Our empirical results clearly show that (i) generative classifiers are more robust than discriminative ones (especially when epsilon is small); (ii) the marginal/logit detection methods did work.\n3d) Observing the above, we are confident to say we have empirically verified the ""off-manifold"" conjecture on generative classifiers.\n\n\nQ4. ""two class CIFAR-10 results are not particularly convincing""\nA4: We presented the CIFAR-binary example because:\n4a) Carlini & Wagner (2017b) stated that MNIST results might not transfer to natural images. Therefore we wanted to see if our findings on MNIST is still true on natural images. \n4b) We did try full CIFAR-10, but none of the existing generative models (VAE/GAN/flow-based/autoregressive models) can achieve satisfactory **clean accuracy** on it. Therefore we instead studied this two-class CIFAR-10 problem in order to evaluate **fully generative classifiers**\n4c) We then presented the fusion model for full CIFAR-10 to address the scalability issue. The baseline there was a VGG-16 network. The generative-discriminative fusion model is more robust than VGG-16 and other discriminative classifiers, showing that the robustness properties of generative classifiers do extend to CIFAR-10. \n\nQ5: “possible gradient masking issues”\nA5: We added the SPSA attack (a state-of-the-art score-based attack by Uesato et al. 2018) in revision. We tried our best to make SPSA strong, by using M=2000 ES samples to estimate a single gradient, and it took 3 days on a Tesla P100 GPU to perform attacks against a generative classifier on 1,000 clean MNIST inputs. Both the distillation-based attacks and the SPSA attacks worked worse than the white-box attacks, suggesting that gradient masking is not the explanation of the robustness of the tested generative classifiers.'}"		HygUOoC5KX	HJxzKI2eGV	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper356/Official_Comment	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper356/Reviewers/Unsubmitted']	27		['everyone']	HygUOoC5KX	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper356/Authors']	1546860154216		1546860154216	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper356/Authors', 'ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

However, learning representations for point clouds is particularly challenging due to their nature as being an unordered collection of points irregularly distributed in 3D space. Graph convolution, a generalization of the convolution operation for data defined over graphs, has been recently shown to be very successful at extracting localized features from point clouds in supervised or semi-supervised tasks such as classification or segmentation. This paper studies the unsupervised problem of a generative model exploiting graph convolution. We focus on the generator of a GAN and define methods for graph convolution when the graph is not known in advance as it is the very output of the generator. The proposed architecture learns to generate localized features that approximate graph embeddings of the output geometry.

Deep neural networks have proven to be successful in many identification tasks, however, from model-based control perspective, these networks are difficult to work with because they are typically nonlinear and nonconvex. Therefore many systems are still identified and controlled based on simple linear models despite their poor representation capability.\n\nIn this paper we bridge the gap between model accuracy and control tractability faced by neural networks, by explicitly constructing networks that are convex with respect to their inputs. We show that these input convex networks can be trained to obtain accurate models of complex physical systems. In particular, we design input convex recurrent neural networks to capture temporal behavior of dynamical systems. Then optimal controllers can be achieved via solving a convex model predictive control problem. Experiment results demonstrate the good potential of the proposed input convex neural network based approach in a variety of control applications. In particular we show that in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks, we could achieve over 10% higher performance using 5 times less time compared with state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning method; and in the building HVAC control example, our method achieved up to 20% energy reduction compared with classic linear models.\n', 'keywords': ['optimal control', 'input convex neural network', 'convex optimization'], 'authorids': ['yizechen@uw.edu', 'yyshi@uw.edu', 'zhangbao@uw.edu'], 'authors': ['Yize Chen', 'Yuanyuan Shi', 'Baosen Zhang'], 'pdf': '/pdf/a300126e215f3ee78390d89b9c64294ff1049e72.pdf', 'paperhash': 'chen|optimal_control_via_neural_networks_a_convex_approach', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\nchen2018optimal,\ntitle={Optimal Control Via Neural Networks: A Convex Approach},\nauthor={Yize Chen and Yuanyuan Shi and Baosen Zhang},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1MW72AcK7},\n}'}		H1MW72AcK7	H1MW72AcK7	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	1332	B1gGTliYYm	['everyone']		['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']	1538087961051		1546848273591	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']

In this work, we introduce a novel on-policy temporally consistent exploration strategy - Neural Adaptive Dropout Policy Exploration (NADPEx) - for deep reinforcement learning agents. Modeled as a global random variable for conditional distribution, dropout is incorporated to reinforcement learning policies, equipping them with inherent temporal consistency, even when the reward signals are sparse. Two factors, gradients' alignment with the objective and KL constraint in policy space, are discussed to guarantee NADPEx policy's stable improvement. Our experiments demonstrate that NADPEx solves tasks with sparse reward while naive exploration and parameter noise fail.

Rather, the pre-computation is done by the server (in a trusted enclave).\n\nLet me clarify the setting we consider. We consider a remote client that interacts with an untrusted cloud server. This server hosts a trusted enclave that runs ML workloads on client data (we assume no enclave on the remote client\'s machine).\n\nWhen the client sends an input $x$ to the enclave, we can accelerate the private computation of $F(x)$ on the server by leveraging an untrusted GPU, as long as the enclave has previously computed $F(r)$.\nAs you correctly observe, computing $F(r)$ takes as long as computing $F(x)$, but the advantage is that $F(r)$ is independent of any client data, and can thus be pre-computed by the server\'s enclave at any time (e.g., during periods of low client usage such as outside of business hours). \nOur protocol thus consists of an ""offline phase"", in which the server\'s enclave slowly pre-computes values $F(r)$ and securely stores them, followed by an ""online phase"" in which the enclave can very quickly and privately compute $F(x)$ on a remote client\'s data.\n\nProtocols with such dual offline and online phases are very common in the secure multiparty-computation literature (e.g., if you look at many of the MPC protocols proposed for the 2017 edition of the iDash competition you linked above, you\'ll find that many require an offline pre-computation phase).\nRequiring such an offline phase is a possible limitation of our protocol which we discuss and acknowledge in our paper. Whether the ""price"" of pre-computing on random values in an offline phase in order to accelerate the online phase is worth it will depend heavily on application requirements.\n\nWe\'d also like to note that the ""lifetime"" of the pre-computed values $F(r)$ need not be very long, as these values can be discarded as soon as they are used (e.g., the enclave could compute values $F(r)$ outside of business hours, and then consume them all a few hours later).

SGX enclaves can of course use RDRAND (or even better RDSEED) to generate a secure random seed to be used with any other software-implemented CSPRNG (the SGX developer guide even suggests this in its section on Random Number Generation).

It is because an attacker could easily read the value of $u+r and $r when enclave passes them to the graphic card. So $r **HAS TO** be pre-calculated by one user remotely.\n\nSo I agree that $r is a one-time pad and it masks secret data. But, $r here is a long-lasting one-time pad and its lifetime is much longer than crypto-safe one-time stuff because a client needs to precompute F(r) offline with poor computing performance. Obviously, if the client has the ability to compute F(r) efficiently and quickly, he can directly compute F(x). So in your proposed approach, one potential assumption is that the one who chooses $r does is a poor guy and can only compute slowly.\n\nSo now it turns out to be another problem -- the lifetime of the one-time pad $r. The user needs to protect his $r in a rather long period of time in an untrusted environment -- contradicting with the target of SGX. This is the limitation and you mentioned it in the paper.\n\nThe only solution may be -- to generate $r in user's enclave and calculate F(r) in an SGX enclave slowly -- using only 128MB memory on an i7 or E3 CPU. How many users would like to pay for this price? such as 1000 hrs of local CPU time in exchange for a short predict calculation?\n\nbtw: the proposed solution relies on seedable PRNG.

Conventional algorithms like stochastic gradient descent optimize the neural networks in the vector space of weights, which is, however, not positively scale-invariant. This mismatch may lead to problems during the optimization process. Then, a natural question is: \\emph{can we construct a new vector space that is positively scale-invariant and sufficient to represent ReLU neural networks so as to better facilitate the optimization process }? In this paper, we provide our positive answer to this question. First, we conduct a formal study on the positive scaling operators which forms a transformation group, denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$. We prove that the value of a path (i.e. the product of the weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling and the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the neural networks under mild conditions. Second, we show that one can identify some basis paths out of all the paths and prove that the linear span of their value vectors (denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$-space) is an invariant space with lower dimension under the positive scaling group. Finally, we design stochastic gradient descent algorithm in $\\mathcal{G}$-space (abbreviated as $\\mathcal{G}$-SGD) to optimize the value vector of the basis paths of neural networks with little extra cost by leveraging back-propagation. Our experiments show that $\\mathcal{G}$-SGD significantly outperforms the conventional SGD algorithm in optimizing ReLU networks on benchmark datasets.

Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time.\nTo address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space.\nThis model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty.\nWe evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set. Our learned representations compare favorably with competitor methods and facilitate downstream tasks on the real world data.', 'keywords': ['deep learning', 'self-organizing map', 'variational autoencoder', 'representation learning', 'time series', 'machine learning', 'interpretability'], 'authorids': ['fortuin@inf.ethz.ch', 'mhueser@inf.ethz.ch', 'locatelf@inf.ethz.ch', 'heiko.strathmann@gmail.com', 'raetsch@inf.ethz.ch'], 'authors': ['Vincent Fortuin', 'Matthias Hüser', 'Francesco Locatello', 'Heiko Strathmann', 'Gunnar Rätsch'], 'TL;DR': 'We present a method to learn interpretable representations on time series using ideas from variational autoencoders, self-organizing maps and probabilistic models.', 'pdf': '/pdf/15c8cbb113daa27eb888054e58b057bcfeb1a203.pdf', 'paperhash': 'fortuin|somvae_interpretable_discrete_representation_learning_on_time_series', '_bibtex': '@inproceedings{\nfortuin2018deep,\ntitle={Deep Self-Organization: Interpretable Discrete Representation Learning on Time Series},\nauthor={Vincent Fortuin and Matthias Hüser and Francesco Locatello and Heiko Strathmann and Gunnar Rätsch},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rygjcsR9Y7},\n}'}		rygjcsR9Y7	rygjcsR9Y7	ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission	[]	562	HJeFJOcqF7	['everyone']		['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']	1538087826744		1546612154333	['ICLR.cc/2019/Conference']
